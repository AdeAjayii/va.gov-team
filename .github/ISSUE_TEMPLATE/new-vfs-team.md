## Welcome and Introduction
Welcome to the Veteran's Administration (VA) Veteran Facing Services (VFS) team! 
As a new VFS team member, you will be working in the web ecosystem we call the VA.gov Platform (or "**The Platform,**" for short).  The tasks on this list are designed to get you up to speed on the role of Platform, making it easier for you to do your job.

Because the VA is a huge organization that serves millions, the Platform it runs on is equally big, complex and multilayered. Most people find that even learning the basics for their own practice area entails a significant learning curve.  The tasks on this checklist will help you acquire those basics as quickly and efficiently as possible. 

## User Story
As a new VFS team member, I need to complete onboarding activities so I can successfully work on my project and support the VA.gov Platform.
