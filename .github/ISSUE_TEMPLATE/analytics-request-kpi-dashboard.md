# Request a Standard KPI Dashboard

## What this form is for

Use this template to request a Standard KPI dashboard ([example](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/447193050)) on Domo for your product.

- Every VFS team should be using the Standard KPI dashboards. If your product *does not* have a Standard KPI Dashboard, please fill this out this template for a Standard KPI dashboard first.

Additional Info

- Please use the [KPI Framework](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/analytics/Analytics%20Playbook/va-gov-platform-analytics-kpi-framework.pdf) for more information on the metrics used in the Standard KPI dashboards.

Your Standard KPI dashboard request will be added to the Platform Analytics & Insights team's customer support queue, and we expect tickets at the top of the queue to be pulled in every Platform Sprint Planning & Refinement (every Wednesday). We appreciate your patience.
