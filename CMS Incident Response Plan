# VA-CMS Incident Response Plan Overview

*This plan is based on the CivicActions SSP Toolkit, under the terms of its GPL and Creative Commons Zero licensing, and the ‘A-CMS Response Procedure Overview’ and adapted for the purposes of the VA-CMS Incident Response Plan project.*

###The basic principle of this document is to provide a response plan based on various system outage incidents and incident types.

In this document, an ‘incident’ refers to system outages - from global to local, weather-based, Citrix, and/or network issues. A Quick Reference Mural can be found at this link.
