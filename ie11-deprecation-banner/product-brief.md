# Product Outline Template
*Iterating on a product? Have a new feature? Check out the [Initiative Brief Template.](https://bit.ly/initiative-brief-template)*

---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

We're creating a banner to conditionally alert Internet Explorer users that IE11 support has been deprecated and they should use a more modern browser to get the best experience on VA. The banner will show on all web properties that use the modernized header (i.e., including legacy Teamsite pages that use the injected modernized header).

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*

VA is ending support for IE11. Vets on IE11 need to switch browsers to avoid issues.

*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*

How might we alert the small number of visitors using IE11 without bothering the vast majority of visitors with unnecessary distraction? 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

We hope users will use a different browser they already have installed, or potentially install a new one.

## Undesired User Outcomes

Keep using an usupported browser.

## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

For the week ending 5/23, IE visitors counted 23,758 (0.83%) per GA report of "All VA.gov website Data."

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

- Objective: Reduced use of IE11 over time.
  - Key result: reduce IE11 traffic by 25% over 3 months

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

- Users will know how to use or obtain another browser.

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

We plan to leverage the design system component [va-alert: Warning](https://design.va.gov/storybook/?path=/docs/components-va-alert--warning).

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*
