# VA COVID-19 Chatbot

## Summary
In conjunction with the VHA Office of Connected Care and Veterans Experience Office, the VA Office of the CTO is developing a COVID-19 FAQ interactive “chatbot” tool to better serve Veterans’ increased demand for information and services during this global pandemic. 

## Problem statement
As the medical provider for millions of Veterans, the VA is the first point of contact for many Veterans with questions about their health and wellbeing. The unprecedented coronavirus pandemic has led to a surge in calls to VA’s contact centers and other communication channels. Veterans and their families have concerns about COVID-19, and about how VA’s response will impact their existing VA health care and services. Additionally, VA is encouraging Veterans to reschedule or convert non-urgent appointments to telehealth appointments, a transaction often completed over the phone. This increased call volume has led to frustrating hold times for Veterans, staffing challenges, and delayed access to clinical expertise for callers with an urgent health care need. Many of the top Veteran questions do not require clinical staff to answer.

## Proposed Solution
We hypothesize that by creating an interactive digital tool (commonly referred to as a “chatbot”), VA can more quickly and directly provide answers to many common questions and direct Veterans to appropriate resources without requiring a phone call. Many healthcare organizations across the country have deployed such tools in recent days. Based on a rapid assessment of potential tools for building a chatbot, we are developing a COVID-19 FAQs chatbot using the Microsoft Healthbot QnA maker. This solution will be offered to VA at no cost for six months (through September 30, 2020). 

The following are in scope for the first iteration of this solution: 
- Multiple choice, decision-tree style interaction (no free text response) 
-	Simple symptom checking based on current CDC tool and Tier 1 non-clinical call center scripts
-	Standardized COVID-related FAQs from VA.gov and Tier 1 contact center scripts in eGain 
-	Hand-offs via offering phone number to call for more information 

The following are out of scope for the first iteration of this solution: 
-	Personalized experience requiring patient “log in”
-	“Warm” hand-offs (i.e. being transferred directly from the chatbot to a human interaction), with chat context shared
-	Integrations with electronic health record 
The chatbot will likely be available to Veterans first through VA.gov, and later through other sources including MyHealtheVet and individual medical facility websites. 

## Team 
The core team for this work is as follows: 
-	Kathy Frisbee (VHA Office of Connected Care) – Business owner 
-	Denise Kitts (Veterans Experience Office) – Business owner 
-	Charles Worthington (VA Chief Technology Officer) 
-	Lauren Alexanderson (Office of VA CTO, health portfolio lead) 
-	Dr. Kaeli Yuen (Office of VA CTO, chatbot project lead) 

The work to build and integrate the chatbot will be completed using an available OIT contract, and managed by the Digital Experience Product Office within the Office of the VA CTO. Deployment will be supported by the VA.gov Platform contract and team.

## Next steps 
Over the coming weeks, we plan to rapidly develop and deploy the first iteration of this chatbot on VA.gov. The Office of Connected Care, Veterans Experience Office, and VA Office of the CTO are working closely to develop this product, develop and capture success metrics, and iterate and expand as necessary to best serve the needs of Veterans.
