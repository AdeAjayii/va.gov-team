# COVID-19 Chatbot Conversation Guide
**3/30/2020**
## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Todd and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about ways to find important information about COVID-19.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, letâ€™s start with a few questions.
- How often do you visit the VA website?
- How often do you call the VA?
- Have you used VA resources for information related to COVID-19?
 - If so, what information were you looking for and where did you find your answer?
 - If not, what resources would you use if you had a question about COVID-19?

## Transition to Tasks
I am going to share a prototype with you. This is an early stage prototype and not everything will function as you may expect. I will give you control of my screen to walk through the prototype. Please talk through what you see, what you are doing and thinking as you interact with the prototype.  
**Backup:** I'm going to send you a link to open. Once open, please share your screen as we walk through the prototype.

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
