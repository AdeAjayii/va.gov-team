# COVID-19 Chatbot Research Report

Prepared by Todd Stanich on April 21, 2020

## Summary
Based on our [first round of research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/covid19-chatbot/blob/master/docs/research/covid-19-chatbot-research-report.md), we validated a click-through decision tree chatbot is an appropriate interaction model for delivering COVID-19 information. The goals of this research focused on the usability of the chatbot and content organization.

During this round, we continued to see some of the same themes from the first round. In addition, we were able to validate the value of topics covered by the chatbot, understand what motives users to use or not use a chatbot, and better understand Veteran's expectations for interacting with a chatbot.



## Goals
- Validate the content the chatbot provides is relevant, helpful, and categorized as expected.
- Validate users are able to successfully interact with the chatbot to find desired information.
- Identify usability shortcomings and potential improvements for interacting with the chatbot.

## Methodology
Interviews were conducted with eight Veterans over three days (April 16, 17, and 20, 2020). During the interviews, Veterans were asked about the types and sources of COVID-19 information they were currently referencing or looking for. Participants then interacted with the chatbot by running through a series of guided tasks.

**Participants**
- Veterans
- Four female and four male
- Between the ages of 25-74

## Findings

Of the three themes from our first round of testing listed below, themes one and two continued to prove true with this round of participants. Theme three was not relevant to this study.  
**Round 1 Theme 1:** There is an overwhelming amount of information available about COVID-19 making reputable and "official" sources highly valued.  
**Round 1 Theme 2:** Chatbots provide an effective method of navigating and communicating a broad range of COVID-19 topics Veterans are seeking.  
**Round 1 Theme 3:** Click through decision tree interaction is favored over strictly free text entry.

### Themes

#### How quickly information can be located is a primary motivator when choosing a tool to answer a question.
We heard many participants use speed to getting an answer as motivation for either using a chatbot or not using a chatbot. The COVID-19 chatbot competes with google searches, pages on va.gov (such as FAQs), phone calls, and secure messaging or emails when Veterans are looking for information from VA.

##### Key Takeaways
1. Participants who said they were likely to use the chatbot often cited long wait times and the hassle of calling as their motivation for considering the chatbot.
2. Participants who said they were **not** likely to use the chatbot believed they could find their answers quicker without the use of a chatbot. During our study, these were the youngest (under 45) participants of the group.
3. If participants would call the VA, they generally looked for a direct number for their need as opposed to a general number.

**Quotes**  
"Is this better than a regular FAQ page? Maybe not. For me I think it would be quicker to scroll through a page without clicking on prompts." - P2

"I would rather call local. Always faster to deal local than someone out in California" - P3 talking about finding a local phone number over the general VA phone number.

"My first instinct would be to click 'ask another question' [as opposed to contact representative] because the call centers are usually backed up" - P4 talking about how they would proceed if they did not see their question listed.

"I like that it provides direct numbers. But I would be hesitant to call." - P4

"I find that phone calls to government agencies are just a loop of answering questions and often you can get answers to those questions quicker elsewhere." - P6

"How quickly can they [Veterans] get to this. Do they have to look for it on the VA homepage, is this like a link directly from the VA newsletter so they can find it and find it quickly." - P6 talking about accessing the chatbot

"Some of these numbers I think would take time for someone to answer since there are so many people calling" - P7

"With my experience with chat I would probably go there [chatbot] first [before calling]. I would probably be able to get it quicker with the chatbot." - P8


#### Expectations of functionality for "chatbots" widely vary.
For some participants, this was their first interaction with a chatbot tool like this. Others have used chatbots before and had certain expectations for how a chatbot should function.

##### Key Takeaways
1. Participants who have not interacted with a chatbot quickly understood the concept and how to interact with the tool.
2. Some participants expected to be able to type questions to the chatbot. When probed, these participants said if they could type free text they might use it in conjunction with the predefined selections.
3. Some participants did not consider this a chatbot since they were clicking prompts and not truly conversing.
4. Some participants expected the chatbot to be in a "chat window".

**Quotes**  
"You’re not conversing, just clicking through prompts, it’s not a chatbot" - P5 describing expectation for a chatbot

"My first thought is that a chatbot would be an actual chat box and prompt me rather than a survey type interface" - P2 describing expectations for a chatbot

"You're calling it a chatbot, but it is really just branching. It would be nice to type a question or search and have your question recognized." - P2

"Old people like to interact, especially when you're home alone, you'll interact with anything. The Vets I go out to breakfast with once or twice a month, we're all computer challenged. Yeah we all have smartphones and can show each other hunting photos with our grandkids, to have this type of program where it would lead you to a crossroads of [what to do] would be good." - P3

"Yes, if I was directed here from a previously trusted site and I came across it, I'd use it. If I was sick, I'd probably do this before the nurse triage line since it is less human to human contact that builds anxiety for me." - P1

"I typically tend to avoid it [chatbots] because it seems like the information answered by chatbot seem to be typical questions that you could find on the website." - P4

"I like that you can't type a question. I think that is where the headache comes in. I've seen some pretty clear questions be misinterpreted by chatbots. I would try to avoid the typing at all costs" - P4

"I would like to be able to go back to see what the other response would be." - P6 describing the desire to scroll back and choose a different option.


#### Topics covered by the chatbot met Veteran's expectations for COVID-19 information.
The topics of information covered by the COVID-19 chatbot met participant's expectations and there were not any major topics missing.

##### Key Takeaways
1. Most participants correctly identified what topics would be covered under the top level categories.
2. Some participants looked for non-COVID information.
3. All participants found answers to be reasonable based on the selection they made.
4. Two participants expected more self help resources (tips and ideas) under the anxiety topic.

**Quotes**  
"The epidemiology of it probably wouldn't be there. I like to look at higher level facts and make my own decisions. I would expect this to share basic information." - P1

"I think it [question answer] is appropriate, it is kind of minimalistic to medium which is probably where it needs to be. It isn't too much information and I'm not overwhelmed." -P1 talking about the level of detail in the answers

"That covers off everything" - P3 talking about topics presented in chatbot

"It looks straightforward. This has both of my questions." - P4

"I like how brief it is." - P4

"I would be looking for more information [clicked on feeling overwhelmed question]. If I wanted a mental health appointment, I would have clicked on that. I'd want more tips and information or maybe links to resources on what I can be doing or how I can relax." - P5

"I feel like it covers the gamut if they are coming to the VA to answer these questions." - P6

"I would prefer, as a Veteran, just seeing information about the VA." - P7

"That covers it pretty well" - P8 in reference to the chatbot topics


### Additional findings
- Some participants appreciated the brevity of some responses.
- Some participants were confused by the initial 911 message. Some thought the symptoms listed were the list of COVID-19 symptoms.
- Some participants wanted the 911 message to be styled differently or called out separately.
- One participant did not notice information was loading at the bottom of the screen after clicking a button. Another user (when we were on a version that did scroll to the bottom) missed that there was information above that was scrolled past.
- Looking and feeling like a trusted VA website is important. Our test was done on a prototype with the a minimal header and one participant wasn't comfortable with it until he saw the full VA logo in the footer.
- Several participants mentioned reading VA email newsletters coming in their email and using that as an entry point to the website.
- Some participants wanted to be able to scroll back through the conversation and click a different button, but the previous buttons were disabled.
- Having external links within the answers was received well.
- The CDC is viewed as a trusted source and we did not experience any negative reaction to the CDC being referenced during the symptom checking flow.
- We received several comments on the CDC checker content:
 - Second paragraph in the introduction about CDC and Microsoft Azure partnership was deemed unnecessary by one participant.
 - There is not a question before the "I agree" and "I don't agree" buttons so it is not clear what the user is agreeing to.
 - In the intro message, it says this is only meant for people in the United States. "Why then does it ask if you live in the US?" one participant asked.
 - "Are you ill, or caring for someone who is ill?" some participants questioned the definition of "ill" and if it was specific to COVID symptoms.

## Future research
- There is an opportunity to conduct research around the discoverability of the chatbot on va.gov to inform link placement and calls to action.
- Throughout our testing, some participants have expressed a desire to input free text. Further research should be conducted to better understand users' expectations for free text entry.
- Our decision to put the chatbot on a standalone page vs some type of overlay or chat window was driven by the need to link from a variety of sources, timeline, technical considerations, and accessibility. Research to include user input in this decision will inform future iterations.
- After launch, monitoring analytics will help identify opportunities to use user research to better understand behaviors we are observing.
