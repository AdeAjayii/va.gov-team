# COVID-19 Chatbot Research Report

Prepared by Todd Stanich on April 7, 2020

## Summary
The purpose of this research was to understand the type of COVID-19 information Veterans are seeking, where they are looking for that information, if a chatbot provides an effective method of discovering and communicating this information, and what interaction model for a chatbot is most effective.

Our research validated that Veterans are actively seeking out information about a variety of topics related to COVID-19. The chatbot prototypes tested were received positively by the participants. The decision tree prototype was viewed more favorably over the free text entry prototype.

## Goals
The goals of this research include:  
- Understand how Veterans seek out information about COVID-19.
- Validate if a chatbot provides satisfactory information and a positive experience.
- Identify the preferred experience to interact with a chatbot (through guided prompts, free text, or hybrid).

## Methodology and Participants

Interviews were conducted with five Veterans over two days (April 2-3, 2020). During the interviews, Veterans were asked about the types and sources of COVID-19 information they were currently referencing or looking for. Participants then interacted with two chatbot prototypes - one with free text entry and the other following a clickable guided decision tree pattern.

**Participants**
- Four male one female
- Ages 55-75+
- Geographically diverse across the US and Puerto Rico

## Findings

### Themes

#### There is an overwhelming amount of information available about COVID-19 making reputable and "official" sources highly valued.
Veterans have no lack of information about COVID-19. Some described the amount of information as, "overwhelming". Sources referenced include the news, facebook, government agencies, healthcare providers, and friends and family.
##### Key Takeaways
1. The source of information is important. Most participants mentioned specific sources of information they avoided or considered to not be reputable. Participants placed value on information from "official" sources such as government agencies.
2. The VA is not always considered for COVID-19 information, but when it is, it is viewed as a reputable source. Some participants had significant interaction with the VA and looked to the organization for COVID-19 information. Participants with less involvement with the VA were less likely to have considered the VA for COVID-19 information.

**Quotes**  
"I listen to the news, but filter a lot of it out. [I get my information] from a website my son sent and a friend who is a doctor" - P1

"Need to be cautious about everything you read. Some are true, some are not. I am not seeking any advice or cure, but those given by local authorities I consider official info." - P3

"I haven't looked for too much information because it is overkill and too many sources" - P5

"Since I've interacted with the VA recently, they have a bar you can click on for more information. I haven't really used it, but it is nice to know that it is there." - P5


#### Chatbots provide an effective method of navigating and communicating a broad range of COVID-19 topics Veterans are seeking.

The chatbot prototypes tested well with all participants finding some value. Participants who regularly interact with the VA found the most value in the chatbot prototypes.

##### Key Takeaways
1. Each Veteran has specific topics about COVID-19 that they find more important and relevant. Participants were looking for information such as symptoms, precautions to take when leaving the house, VA appointments and facilities changes, and statistics about infections and spread. All participants were able to find information about their desired topic while interacting with the chatbot.
2. Most participants said if they were aware of this tool, they would consider using it before calling the VA with a question. The most common reason for considering the chatbot over calling was being able to avoid a long wait.
3. Some participants responded favorably to the chatbot directing them to other VA services, such as secure messaging and telehealth.

**Quotes**  
"This is helpful. Never used secure messaging or telehealth before. I've done everything through the phone until now" - P3 in response to the chatbot providing information about telehealth and secure messaging

"It doesn't say how exactly you get it [COVID-19] from someone else. This response makes me think animals could also be involved, what if I have a pet?" - P3 after entering a free text question about how COVID-19 spreads from person-to-person and receiving an unhelpful answer about the origin of COVID-19 causing confusion

"I avoid calling a government agency if I can. I would rather use apps" - P4

"Oh absolutely!" - P2 in reference to if they would use a chatbot


#### Click through decision tree interaction is favored over strictly free text entry.
Participants were more successful obtaining a suitable answer using the decision tree prototype over the free text prototype. Participants were also less likely to encounter undesired or confusing responses during the process.

##### Key Takeaways
1. When the free text entry prototype responded with a relevant answer, participants responded positively. When it failed to understand the question or returned an answer that was only somewhat relevant, the participants responded negatively and often failed to recover and get back on track. When interacting with the free text entry prototype, several participants input single keywords as opposed to full questions rich with keywords.
2. The click through decision tree prototype was more likely to lead to the desired information without a mismatch in expectations between the chatbot and user.
3. Some participants identified use cases for both free text and the decision tree interaction model. When the free text chatbot responded with an appropriate answer it was reached more quickly by entering free text.

**Quotes**  
"I like this one better [decision tree]. It is setting up the context" - P1

"Clicking the prompt is much easier. Typing, especially for those of us with a language barrier, sometimes it is difficult to write English." - P3

"I like this one better [decision tree], but I want to be able to ask questions too. This one [decision tree] rewards you as you go through it." - P4

"I like the type in better even though it didn't take me to what I wanted to find out. Probably because I'm more familiar with computers." - P5



### Additional Findings
- Some participants entered single keywords in the free text prototype instead of fully formed questions.
- One participant entered proper names of stores instead of generic names (CVS instead of pharmacy) in the free text prototype which caused the chatbot to not understand the question.
- Some participants expected to be able to scroll back through the conversation and click on any button in the previous conversation.
- Some participants missed that they needed to type "yes" or "no" to be able to ask another question.
- Some participants expected to be able to ask follow up questions that were in context of the original question.
