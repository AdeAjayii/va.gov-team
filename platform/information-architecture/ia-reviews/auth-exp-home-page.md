### Meetings Notes and Background Info

**10/8/2020 - Regroup**

- Will no longer replace the home page, will live as iteration of dashboard
- Page includes
  - Name/badge section includes link to profile and small bits of info - dis rating, claims in progress and upcoming appointments
  - Health care section
  - Upcoming appointments, active prescriptions, link to lab and test results, secure message/inbox
  - Learn more about your VA health benefits
- Questions posed
  - My VA and My Health - with initial heavy focus on health care, what what will the relationship between these entities?
	- "Go to" links / "Learn more about your VA health benefits"
    - Hub pages give primary focus to getting benefits, what is the most relevant destination for each?
    - Hub page is very focused on getting benefits, is there a more helpful place to take users or something they may be commonly looking for from this experience?
	- CTAs
    - Scheduling takes you into tool
		- Others take you to MHV
    - Recommend minimizing CTAs

**9/24/2020 - Design intent**
- Meg attended: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/13415

**4/16/20 - Kick-off**
- when logged in you have the home page and the My VA Dashboard - they compete for attention with the Veteran
- Dashboard is supposed to be a personalized space with VA - many don't use or know about it
- Current dashboard is designed like a content page, doesn't utilize the design system
- User goals:
  - easy access to tools/tasks specific to my VA experience
  - easily see status updates and notifications
  - quickly complete tasks the user came to do and move on
- Biz goals: 
 - lay a foundation for a personalized home page that is relevant to the user type and their tasks
 - have a place to highlight status updates and notifications
 - retire My VA
- Future thoughts for authenticated tools navigation 
- Logged in home page vs profile?
- Timeline - launch before end of year would be awesome, doing discovery phase now, this will likely be broken down into a couple projects
