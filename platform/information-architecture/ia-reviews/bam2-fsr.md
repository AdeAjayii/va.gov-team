## <a name="notes"></a>Meetings Notes and Background Info

10/20/2020 - 
- FSR is used by other departments, although submission process may be different (where its routed to)
- FSR not needed for every debt, once filled out it is good for 6 months, can be used for multiple debts (its the same information)
- A veteran may want different payment plans for different debt - i.e. a waiver for C&P and monthly plan for education
- SSN and File # identifiers
- Team is unsure how health copays/debt play into this, separate process likely, although health care sends users to a pdf of the FSR for submitting a waiver.  
  - Health care has waiver (asking us to stop collection action on the debt), write-off (asking us to cancel the debt), or compromise (asking us to accept a lower amount of money as full payment of the debt)
- Discussed "the buddy form" 21-4138, sort of a generic form that is submitted with many forms as supplemental, mostly open text field
- Discussed the option of using a wizard as potential gating to direct user to correct process/form
- Need to include linking between debt management and health care to ensure users are directed appropriately, even though they may be very different things



10/13/2020 - Content/IA Strategy kick-off - Leah, Danielle, Riley, Rebecca, Matt, Brian L, Peggy

- Rewrite debtman to funnel the the veteran into the correct option and then to fill out the FSR form the first time
- The full FSR needs to be completed regardless of the resolution
- Need
  - Ia/content strategy for unauthenticated content
  - Ia/content support for tool/form
- Early calendar year/Q1 release - they will be sending out debt letters that may/may not realize they have debt due…anticipating overload of calls.  
- Discovery work with stakeholders is complete, talking with VSOs will be done this week, will go into design after that


10/7/2020 - Kick-off
- Debt collection has been suspended for coronavirus since march. There are 1.2 million veterans that are going to find out they have debt when it resumes
- The Financial Status Report (FSR) is the starting point of the debt resolution process
- Includes
	- Fill out FSR form
	- Write a justification letter to submit with FSR (for waiver or compromise) - unsure if this will be part of the FSR form flow or on its own
- Peggy: Where do you see this form living - within debt management section?  Team was unsure
- Mikki: Debt man site - what content needs to come over to support this tool??
	- debt man needs to be retired since it’s a heavy focus with this work and should move with this
- Early Q1 timing
