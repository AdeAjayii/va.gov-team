## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
The digital form will live next to the 'How to apply' page on the same level. Currently, the eBenefits form is housed under 'How to apply', but we have removed links to this feature from the proposed site map below. This form will need to be retired and redirected accordingly, so we recommend working with stakeholders to ensure this flow is accounted for.

## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs

**1) H1 of page - New**
- URL: www.va.gov/housing-assistance/disability-housing-grants/apply–grant-form-26-4555
- Breadcrumb: Home > Housing assistance > Housing grants > H1 of page
- Notes: We are proposing "grant" in the link as an identifier for this form. We believe 'housing' may not be specific enough for this form and using acronyms, such as SAH or SHA, may not be easily recognizable by Veterans who are not yet familiar with the different forms. In addition, [information on /introduction]
