### IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements. *

**Approach:**
- With the launch of BDD, all disability claims will be handled on va.gov and we will no longer need to link to eBenefits for any claim scenarios.
- The static content for this application already exists on va.gov, IA and Public Websites team has reviewed existing content for changes/restructuring needed to best support the new claim scenario. This content currently exists as part of the "How to file a claim" page and child pages. 
- The site map below shows the before and after of existing content pages and changes to the IA - some pages have been merged and some removed/retired

### Navigation Changes and Entry and Exit Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*

- ENTRY POINTS ALREADY EXIST WITHIN THE DISABILITY HUB, SERVICE MEMBER HUB AND BEST BETS WITHIN SEARCH.  NEED TO REVIEW SEO DATA AND RESEARCH TO DETERMINE BEST LABELING AND KEYWORDS, AND ANY OTHER PLACEMENT OPTIONS.  OUR STANDARD IS TO AVOID USING "BRANDED" NAMES (I.E. BENEFITS DELIVERY AT DISCHARGE), BUT THIS WILL NEED TO BE REVIEWED. 

Entry points to pre-discharge
Priority | Placement | Description
--- | --- | ---

***Priority:** Must = Required; Should = Strongly encouraged/best practice; Consider = Suggestion/at your discretion/possible enhancement* 

<hr>

### Redirects <br>
*Identify if any redirects are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

- REDIRECTS WILL BE NEEDED FOR ANY URL CHANGES TO ENSURE OLD URLS ARE REDIRECTED TO THE NEW URLS.  

Please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis&labels=content-ia-team%2C+ia&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance. 
*For more information, see the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).*

### Meetings Notes and Background Info

6/18/20 - User research and SEO findings
- Research did show that users struggled to find the pre-discharge page - they utilized search, disability menus and service member hub
- SEO data shows more activity for "BDD" and "benefits delivery at discharge", less for "pre-discharge claim"
