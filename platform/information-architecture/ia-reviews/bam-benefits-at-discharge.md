### IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements. *

**Approach:**

- STATIC CONTENT FOR THIS APPLICATION ALREADY EXISTS, NEED TO WORK THROUGH CONTENT STRATEGY AND IA TO DETERMINE IF ANY CHANGES TO EXISTING CONTENT ARE NEEDED. LIKELY WE WILL NEED TO SIMPLIFY EXISTING CONTENT AND LOOK AT LABELING AND TERMINOLOGY USED. 
- THE CLAIM FORM WILL BE PART OF THE EXISTING 526

Page | URL | Breadcrumb
--- | --- | ---


**General Details**
- Please connect with your writer/editor on the proper verbiage and capitalization of the last element of the breadcrumb

### Navigation Changes and Entry and Exit Points <br>
*The primary entry points and changes to global navigation, as well as any potential crosslinking opportunities*

- ENTRY POINTS ALREADY EXIST WITHIN THE DISABILITY HUB, SERVICE MEMBER HUB AND BEST BETS WITHIN SEARCH.  NEED TO REVIEW SEO DATA AND RESEARCH TO DETERMINE BEST LABELING AND KEYWORDS, AND ANY OTHER PLACEMENT OPTIONS.  OUR STANDARD IS TO AVOID USING "BRANDED" NAMES (I.E. BENEFITS DELIVERY AT DISCHARGE), BUT THIS WILL NEED TO BE REVIEWED. 

Entry points to pre-discharge
Priority | Placement | Description
--- | --- | ---

***Priority:** Must = Required; Should = Strongly encouraged/best practice; Consider = Suggestion/at your discretion/possible enhancement*

### Redirects <br>
*Identify if any redirects are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

- REDIRECTS WILL BE NEEDED FOR ANY URL CHANGES TO ENSURE OLD URLS ARE REDIRECTED TO THE NEW URLS.  

Please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis&labels=content-ia-team%2C+ia&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance. 
*For more information, see the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).*

### Meetings Notes and Background Info

6/18/20 - User research and SEO findings
- Research did show that users struggled to find the pre-discharge page - they utilized search, disability menus and service member hub
- SEO data shows more activity for "BDD" and "benefits delivery at discharge", less for "pre-discharge claim"
