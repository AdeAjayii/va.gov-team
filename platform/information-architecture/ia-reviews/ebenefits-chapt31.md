# IA Review and Recommendations
**STATUS: IN PROGRESS**

**Team:** eBenefits

**Product/Featue:** Chapt 31/Veteran Readiness and Employment (formerly Voc Rehab)

**Background/Context:** Migrating the ability to apply for chapter 31 benefits from eBenefits to va.gov

**IA Completed Date:** 

**IA Request:** https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/9086

### IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements. *

**Approach:**

- This work effort includes the addition of an online application.  Static content for this benefit already exists, the new online application will replace the existing link to eBenefits. 
- In addition to the launch of this application, the VR&E program has changed names.  The name change will be implemented by the time the form goes live.  In discussions with stakeholders it was agreed upon to leave the URLs at "/vocation-rehabilitation". This decision is based on guidelines for using keywords, descriptive words and non-branded terminology for URLs.  A vanity URL will be established for a shortened URL and use of the acronym "VRE".

Page | URL | Breadcrumb
--- | --- | ---
VR&E Static content page | https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/ | Home > Careers and employment > Veteran Readiness and Employment | This is an existing content page.  The program name is changing, resulting in a change to the breadcrumb, but the existing URL will remain the same. 
Application | https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/apply-vre-form-28-0588/  | Home > Careers and employment > Veteran Readiness and Employment > Apply for VR&E form 28-0588

### Redirects <br>
*Identify if any redirects are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

- The eBenefits team will coordinate the redirect of the eBenefits version of the application with that technical team.  VSP will not be handling any redirects from eBenefits. 

Please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis&labels=content-ia-team%2C+ia&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance. 
*For more information, see the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).*

### Meetings Notes and Background Info

**7/20/2020 - Design Intent**

- enter form auth or unauth, can continue through form unauth
- form wizard - routes to chapt 36 or 31
- discussed the different scenarios of the wizard resultingin links versus buttons
- using similar wizard on ch 36 form, will usability test the call-outs vs buttons to ensure users know what is expected of them next
- have feedback on the purpose of the wizard here - validating eligibility versus routing to correct form
- IA feedback documented here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/11441
