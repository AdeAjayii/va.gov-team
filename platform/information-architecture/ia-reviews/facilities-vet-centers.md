9/3/20 - Vet center kick off  

- Vet centers are part of VHA, community based centers that offer many services for Veterans and families, frequently the first touch point a Veteran has with VA, integral with the transition into VA, do help with full journey, help with major adjustments after Veterans return from combat
- Relationships with the vet center can be long term/life long
- There is no online presence except basic page facility locator
- Started services taxonomy, looking to shift into the page design and then shift back to taxonomy to fine tune
- Drupal managed content and authoring experience, basic information through API
- Pages should look like VA but look like a Vet Center
- Ryan T - there was work done on this earlier; Michelle - we decided to start from scratch to hear what it is they need and to not start biased, will reference
- They have a lot of events
- Success measures - increasing utilization of services (not sure how to get at that), traffic to pages, consider focusing in on behaviors we can drive from these page (i.e. the CTAs we have)
- 300 stand alone facilities, a handful of outstations, many informal access points, mobile vet centers.  Will likely focus on the primary vet centers, not as formal as a network as VAMCs, this structure is a bit TBD yet, sent earlier IA work to Meg
