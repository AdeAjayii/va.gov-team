## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
*Identify if any redirects are needed.  This is not intended to be a complete and final list of redirect needs, but directional information only.*  

-  Redirects will be needed for almost all pages in the existing copays and debt experiences based on a top level page change, hierarchical changes, and movement of pages from the health care sub-directory to the debt sub-directory. 
-  Two pages on getting assistance for copay debt will be redirected to a new single content page.
-  All redirects will be detailed out in a rediret request once URLs are finalized.

Please submit a request for the redirect using the [Redirect Request Issue Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=mnorthuis&labels=content-ia-team%2C+ia&template=redirect-request.md&title=Redirect+Request) at least 2 weeks in advance. 
*For more information, see the [Redirect Request Process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/information-architecture/request-redirect.md).*
