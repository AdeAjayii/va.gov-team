### Background & Meeting Notes

**Content/IA synch - 6/23/2020**
- need to go through FAQs to determine what should be part of static content page and what should be part of tool. Do we move FAQs over at all or do we continue to link to legacy page?
- Are there entry points needed from existing content to tool, or does the tool lead to the other content for how to pay?
- Danielle to convert intake ticket to an epic, next step will be content strategy work to define how much content do we need to work with, then we can refine IA/flow as necessary
- team is hoping to do usability testing in early July

**Kick-off - 3/17/2020**
- This is an MVP effort based on the Veterans Fair Debt Notice Act passed in 2018
- VEO engaged DEPO
- Many different benefits create financial relationships with VA and can create Veteran debt - i.e. VA makes education payment to Veteran but Veteran does not complete credit they were paid for so they need to pay VA back. 
- VA Central Debt Management Center "DMC" - manages all of these debts
- There are different types of debt letters (possibly 50ish) - new debt, delinquent, 3rd notice, etc - each business line might have a variation of those types
- Only a small subset of letter types have been digitized and will be part of this work effort (they are part of eFolder)
- Solution ideas from team: static content page for digital management of debt, notifications of new debt letters, online viewing of letters, updated content of letters - all focused on MVP subset of letters initially
- there is an office page https://www.va.gov/debtman/
- There is pay.gov and pay.va.gov

Thoughts/Questions: 
- Even though only a few are digitized, will there be an effort to create standardized categorizations/taxonomy of all the letters in prep or as part of this work?
- How does this integrate with Profile?
