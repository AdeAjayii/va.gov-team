# IA Design and Recommendations
**STATUS: IN PROGRESS**

**Team:**  Public websites

**Product/Featue:** Resources and support

**Background/Context:**   Originally referred to as "Learning center", the team is creating a space on va.gov to house resource and support content that will be published via Drupal. 

**IA Request:** https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/14445

**On this page:**
- [User flows](#flows)
- [IA structure, URLs and breadcrumbs](#ia)
- [Navigation and entry points](#nav)
- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Meeting notes](#notes)


## <a name="flows"></a>User/Page Flows <br>
*Description of how users will flow through the experience*


## <a name="ia"></a>IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements.*

### Structure
- The resources and support experience will live within a sub-directory of VA.gov that will allow use of a Search.gov feature to execute a scoped search within just the resources and support content/experience.  
- All URLs and breadcrumbs will be generated by Drupal based on the primary category label, tag label and article title entered by the content publisher.  System rules must be in place to ensure proper formatting of the URL (i.e. all lower-case, all words separated by dashes, no special characters, etc)
- Article titles (H1s) should have a character limit of no more than 60 characters
- Once content is published, URLs should not change even if the category, tag or H1 is modified.  Any URL changes will need to be requested through the redirect process to ensure the change is vetted for any issues/conflicts and redirects can be put into place.

### URLs and breadcrumbs 
- The recommendation is to include the primary category in the breadcrumb and URL to aid users and search engines in understanding the context of the article. However, with the currently defined primary categories, the following things should be considered:
  - The benefit categories are not mutually exclusive but only 1 can be selected.   This would likely create a situation where content publishers may not assign similar articles to a consistent primary category resulting in articles not being displayed in an expected category list, or being displayed in a category that seems in accurate.  (i.e. an article about decision reviews may be categorized "decision reviews" most of the time, but some may be categorized "disability"; a user looking for information pertaining to their education appeal may not find it or may be confused that the information does not apply to them). 
  - The "other topics" category does not provide helpful context or description for users or search engines.  Given there are only 2 categories in the initial launch, this may not provide much benefit. 
  - The future amount and type of content that will be moved into the resources and support experience is still a bit unclear, which means that the categories could evolve requiring a reclassification of articles.
