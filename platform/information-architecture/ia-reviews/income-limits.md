## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*

This illustrates an additional user flow for Veterans who wouldn't qualify due to their income (above $90k).


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>

The Income Limits tool will be a new page in the More info and resources section of the health hub. It will be after /copay-rates and before /health-needs-conditions



## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*


**1) Income Limits Tool - New**
- URL: TBD based on H1
- Breadcrumb: Home > Health Care > [H1 of page]
- Notes: H1 TBD by Sitewide Content. Also, all consecutive pages in the flow (like the steps in the flow) will build from this root URL. For those additional URL slugs, you can follow our URL standards in word selection and formatting (you don't need to ask us for those -- they're in design system > content style guide). Let us know if you need help with that!


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
*A list of new internal entry points, as well as changes to any existing entry points. This list focuses on the primary entry points and does not include all possible crosslinking opportunities.*
