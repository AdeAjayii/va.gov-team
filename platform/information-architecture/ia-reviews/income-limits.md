This illustrates an additional user flow for Veterans who wouldn't qualify due to their income (above $90k) -- we want to make sure that all income levels are represented, so that there is no 'dead end' for a veteran who doesn't see their income listed.

The Income Limits tool will be a new page in the More info and resources section of the health hub. It will be after /copay-rates and before /health-needs-conditions



## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs


**1) Income Limits Tool - New**
- URL:  www.va.gov/health-care/income-limits
- Breadcrumb: Home > Health Care > [H1 of page]
- Notes: Also, all consecutive pages in the flow (like the steps in the flow) will build from this root URL. For those additional URL slugs, you can follow our URL standards in word selection and formatting (you don't need to ask us for those -- they're in design system > content style guide). Let us know if you need help with that!


## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

3. Your health care costs - Update link
  - Note: Content will take care of this change, but we wanted to reiterate that we think replacing the link on this page with the link to the new tool and updating the content is important. We guess that most users will find the tool either on this page or the Eligibility page --> we recommend verifying this in user testing.
