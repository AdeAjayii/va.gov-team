This illustrates an additional user flow for Veterans who wouldn't qualify due to their income (above $90k).

The Income Limits tool will be a new page in the More info and resources section of the health hub. It will be after /copay-rates and before /health-needs-conditions



## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs


**1) Income Limits Tool - New**
- URL: TBD based on H1
- Breadcrumb: Home > Health Care > [H1 of page]
- Notes: H1 TBD by Sitewide Content. Also, all consecutive pages in the flow (like the steps in the flow) will build from this root URL. For those additional URL slugs, you can follow our URL standards in word selection and formatting (you don't need to ask us for those -- they're in design system > content style guide). Let us know if you need help with that!

Content and page hierarchy for the updated link TBD by Sitewide Content.
