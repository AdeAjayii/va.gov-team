# IA Review and Recommendations
**STATUS: IN PROGRESS**  

**Team:** eBenefits

**Product/Featue:** Personalized Career Planning and Guidance / Chapt 36 (formerly known as Education & Career Counseling)

**Background/Context:** Online application for chapter 36 benefits

**IA Request:** https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/9082

**IA Completed Date:**

### IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements. *

**IA/Content Strategy Approach:**
- This work effort includes the addition of an online application. Static content for this benefit already exists, the new online application will replace the existing link to eBenefits.
- Included in this work is the update to the program name to "Personalized career planning and guidance".  The existing URLs, which are not intended to be a branded program name, will continue to utilize "/education-and-career-counseling". This is the same approach taken with the rebranding of the VR&E program.
