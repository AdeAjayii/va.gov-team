### IA Structure, URLs and Breadcrumbs <br>
*Description of IA or link to site map documentation, the final URLs to be used and breadcrumb requirements. *

**IA/Content Strategy Approach:**
- As part of this work, a separate content effort is also happening to update the program name to "Personalized career planning and guidance".  The existing URLs, which are not intended to be a branded program name, will continue to utilize "/education-and-career-counseling". This is the same approach taken with the rebranding of the VR&E program.
