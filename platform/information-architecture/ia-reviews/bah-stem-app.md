### Meetings Notes and Background Info

**6/1/20 - Usability testing prep**
- Include findability task within research
- the breadcrumbs and URLs on the existing education forms were never modernized/updated as part of WBC, this new application should be launched with correct IA
- Legacy page on STEM still exists, should this be moved over?
- Feedback documented here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/9699


**4/21/20 - kick-off**
- breaking out the STEM application into its own stand alone application
- currently part of the 1995, will be the 22-10203
- how to apply wizard will be modified to direct users appropriately
- hoping to reduce/eliminate submissions for this scholarship from  users that are not eligible
- this is a lower priority on the education list, timing is tbd but possibly early July
- Open questions:
  - Existing legacy page wasn't migrated during WBC: https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/fgib/stem.asp; need to determine if this content should be migrated over, it currently links directly to the 1995
