### Meetings Notes and Background Info

8/4/2020 - Design intent
- Questions
  - Is there a landing page in addition to the registration page?
  - FAQ page?
  - Search optimized or hidden?
  - Cross-linking from any content?


7/30/2020 - kick-off meeting
- exception for usability testing collab point
- help getting veterans in the door to participate in covid19 related clinical research - potential vaccines, therapuetics, plasma, etc.
- VA is well positioned to be big contributor of this research, largest health network and large patient population, but not fully prepared to jump in
- looking for assistance on building awareness, providing information on opportunities and giving a digital mechanism to participate
- plan is to use evergreen content to reach a large population, point to a research landing page, main CTA to submit limited info to "register interest" in one or more studies
- info is then delivered to research facilitators and they take from there in terms of contacting and getting consent
- this is national level research, different from local facilities, possible cross-linking but viewed as national registration single front door and then sent out
- MHV newsletter, VETtext, will be fairly large campaign
- crosslinking on va.gov - covid faqs, chatbot, other places that users are reading/learning about covid
- interested in reaching communities underserved in research
- looking for participants that haven't been diagnosed, currently in treatment, people who have recovered
- PW/Danielle writing content, focused on high level research type, not specific initiatives
- MVP is unauthenticated users
- research is next week, talking with million veteran program
