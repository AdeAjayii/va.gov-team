### Meetings Notes and Background Info

7/29/2020 - Kick-off
- how does a Veteran complete pre- and post-appointment questionaires and screeners
- discovery research revealed Veterans are doing a lot of docs on paper and normally not doing it ahead of time, lots of repetitive questions asked
- want info to be leveraged across all VA and community providers - needs to meet needs of Veterans and clinical teams
- ability to do forms when, where and with what device they choose
- questionaires are based on appointments, based on VAOS scheduling integration, will trigger the type of form they need and then hopefully utilizing the VETtext to send notification that the form is out there.  
- want it to be a part of the va.gov experience
- Collecting info will be focus, MHV will control sharing of data and authentication
- forms can be customized by clinic and specialty
- form builder tool is needed, want to standardize where they can but need to allow customizations
