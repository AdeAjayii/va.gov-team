# Vanity URL Guidelines & Request Process

**What is a Vanity URL?** <br>
A vanity URL is a custom URL that exists to help users easily get to a specific page of VA.gov


**When is a vanity URL appropriate?** 

The key purpose of a vanity, or, shortened URL is to provide an easy to read, understand, remember, type, print and share path for content or tools on VA.gov

SUPPORTED SCENARIOS

## Guidelines

**VANITY URLS WILL UTILIZE WWW.VA.GOV/ WITH THE ADDITION OF A KEYWORD SEGMENT AFTER THE "/"**
- We will not create a custom subdomain or top-level domain
- This ensures we maintain the va.gov brand, consistency and authority

URL Keyword Segment Guidelines:
- Keep keyword segment to no more than 3 words
- Use the most descriptive keywords, do not load
- Do not repeat "va" in keyword segment
- Eliminate stop words, unless they add to the context or readability (i.e. memorials-and-benefits vs memorial-benefits)
- Utilize plain language
- Utilize dashes between distinct words - i.e. home loans is 2 words
- Lowercase letters only
- Be specific to the topic or action
- Only use abbreviations when the abbreviation is a well-known acronym or term


**MUST BE SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER THAN THE URL CURRENTLY ON THE SITE**
- If the current URL has only one segment after the top level domain, there is no need to create a vanity/shortened url - i.e. www.va.gov/careers-employment should not be shortened
- Short URLs should be maximum of 50 characters (~70 characters is limit on SERPs)
    
**CONTENT MUST CURRENTLY EXIST ON THE MODERNIZED SITE - NOT A SUBDOMAIN**
- The landing page should clearly answer to the intended topic/question - i.e. if the communication is about home loans, send the user to the home loans landing page, not the housing assistance hub

**WE DO NOT MAINTAIN THE VISIBILITY OF THE SHORTENED URL, ALL SHORT URLS ARE 301 REDIRECTS**
- When a user enters or clicks on the vanity/shortened URL, they will be redirected to the existing content page and the full URL path will be exposed in the browser 

**NO SHORT URLs FOR PDFs OR ANY DOCUMENTS/FILES**
- All shortened URLs must have a landing page to provide context, they should not go to files or documents

**ALL SHORTENED URLS SHOULD BE UNIQUE TO PREVIOUSLY USED URLs**
- Ensure that the new URL isn't already in use for a different purpose
- Ensure that the new URL wasn't already used in the past for a different purpose
- Ensure that the new URL isn't remarkably similar to a URL in use   (i.e. homeloan vs home-loan vs homeloans)
