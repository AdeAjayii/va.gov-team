# VSP Analytics & Insights Process for the Covid Dashboard on Domo

*Overview:* Outline of the rules of engagement for adding data to the Covid dashboard on Domo.

*Audience:* VSP and VA Covid Stakeholders

## Process

### Providing Data

When sending data, please:

**1. Send over email only.** 

*Some of the data can be sensitive, so please avoid adding the data directly to the public repo. Datasets can also get lost in Slack.*
  
  - Send directly to Chante, and carbon copy (CC) the rest of the VSP Analytics & Insights team (Joanne, Amy, Jon, Brian, & Kimberley)
  - Begin the subject line with "DOMO COVID"
  
**2. Send only raw data**
  - Examples: CSVs, Excel, Text (for themes, etc.), API documentation
  
  *PDFs cannot be added*
  
**3. Define the data that is being sent**
  - If the dataset is new, please provide context around the data so that we can properly categorize and visualize it 
  - Questions to aid with context:
    - What is the source of the data?
    - Do the column headers properly explain what the data in that column means?
    - What types of decisions would the data help make?
