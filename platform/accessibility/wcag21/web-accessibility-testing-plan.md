# VA.gov Web and Content Accessibility Testing Plan
Accessibility is a VSP Platform core requirement for all web applications and static content. The purpose of this document is to outline:

1.	The requirements that will guide web application and content builds
1.	The accessibility tools and materials that will be used during testing
1.	The testing protocol and steps that will be taken when reviewing the accessibility capabilities in the app

## Section 1: Accessibility Requirements & Approach
The following items are based on [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) Level A and AA success criteria, organized by product function. Each item description reflects the requirement type, the relevant success criteria and implementation requirements. 

- Items that have “Design”/ “Designs” bolded reflect standards that must be facilitated by the design workstream 
- Items that have “Programmatically” bolded reflect standards that focus on technical implementation 
- Applicable WCAG 2.1 requirements are also included to reference best practice and may be followed in cases where added implementation scope is minimal.
- Accessibility standards that relate to non-existent functionality in the app are marked N/A. In the event that the app’s design changes to include relevant functionality, these standards will be candidates to prioritize as requirements.
