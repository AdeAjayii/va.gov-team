Accessibility testing plan template
This is the template file for teams who need to create an accessibility testing plan for their project on VA.gov. 

- Items that have “Design”/ “Designs” bolded reflect standards that must be facilitated by the design workstream 
- Items that have “Programmatically” bolded reflect standards that focus on technical implementation 
- Applicable WCAG 2.1 requirements are also included to reference best practice and may be followed in cases where added implementation scope is minimal.
- Accessibility standards that relate to non-existent functionality in the app are marked N/A. In the event that the app’s design changes to include relevant functionality, these standards will be candidates to prioritize as requirements.
