# [IN PROGRESS] Writing 508 issue tickets

Accessibility issues may be particularly challenging to document. Communicating why it matters and the potential remediation techniques needs to be coherent for the audience, which may range from product managers to designers to developers. 

## Title

The title of the issue ticket should communicate a few things about the issue:

    * severity
    * category
    * issue itself
    * location
    
Since the issue title appears in various places, it is helpful to communicate necessary details in the title so it isn't necessary to open the issue itself. For example, on an epic for an accessibility review, it's helpful for PMs to know the severity level so they may prioritize for launch, and the location of the issue so the team knows where it needs to be fixed.

## Severity

## Description

## Acceptance Criteria

## Environment

## Possible Fixes (optional)
