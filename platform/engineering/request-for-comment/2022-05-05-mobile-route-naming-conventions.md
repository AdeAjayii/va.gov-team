# RFC: Mobile Routes naming conventions

- Date: 2022-05-05
- Related Issue: https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/va-mobile---backend-61d75d03a7505500147ec7f6/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/2937

## Background
Mobile routes currently have some inconsistencies in their naming conventions, such as:
- Sometimes using snake_case over kebab-case (maintenance_windows, message_drafts)
- :ids are after the resource action rather than before (canceling appointments)
- Not nesting under parent products (the 'health' and 'benefits' app)

## Motivation
Keeping naming consistent will make using the Mobile API much easier to use and is generally a good practice for maintainability. 

## Design
Version all endpoint that do not meet the naming convention as follows:
```
                            maintenance_windows GET    /maintenance-windows(.:format)                                                mobile/maintenance_windows#index

                                                POST   /v1/health/appointments(.:format)                                             mobile/v1/health/appointments/appointments#create

Notes: 
- Only endpoints being changed are shown above
- All of these will be versioned from v0 to v1
- Adding parent products (health, benefits) is adding a namespace so the controllers will be nested in a folder as well.
- Naming conventions will also be documented on mobile documentation site. 

See updated routes file to see implications to controllers:

## Risks
Must throughly test new endpoints to ensure nothing breaks.
