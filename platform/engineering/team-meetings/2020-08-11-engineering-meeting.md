## Meeting goals

_These are aspirational, and subject to change._

- We want a venue for cross-program engineers to engage with one another, share knowledge, present demos/talks, raise concerns, and to solicit advice.
- We want to maintain a safe atmosphere for learning, to foster understanding and empathy. To that end, we do not want to have work subjected to review or judgment, and we do not expect any commitments to be made regarding issues raised.
- We want to provide a clear agenda in advance of the meeting, so that folks can come prepared, and so that we spend each other's time wisely.
