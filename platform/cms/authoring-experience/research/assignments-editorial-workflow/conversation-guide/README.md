# Conversation Guide for Assignments and Editorial Workflow Usability Study

## Introduction

_(About 5 minutes)_

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Jordana, and I'm a designer and researcher for the VA.gov CMS. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes for me. Today we're going to be testing a new way for CMS users to review and move content in the editorial workflow. During this test, I will ask you to share your screen so that I can follow along with you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the new CMS to better meet your needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

* You'll be interacting with a prototype during this session. This means that you will be interacting with a replica of CMS, but some areas may be clickable while others aren't.

* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.

I want to verify that you are okay with me recording screen and audio today.


## Warm-up Questions

_(About 5 minutes)_

* How's your day going so far?

* Have you participated in usability testing before?

[If yes] How'd it go?

[If no] Ok, it's always fun to try something new. Thanks for be willing to participate in this study!


## Main Tasks

#### Task 1: Designate content to be taken care of by a member of your team 

Let's say you're working on the Coronavirus FAQ content, but there has been a change in your work priority and you need your team mate Quinn to update the page content. Using the prototype, how would you pass the content to Quinn?

#### Task 2: Now give the content to someone else to work on

After passing the content to Quinn, you suddenly realized that Quinn had gone on vacation. Point out in the prototype what action you would use to pass the content to another person and why. 

#### Task 3: Designate someone to take a look at a piece of content for approval

You finished working on the Coronavirus FAQ and want your supervisor Jordan to give a thumbs up before you send the final version to a stakeholder. Using the prototype, how would you request Jordan's opinion.

#### Task 4: Send content to an external stakeholder for approval

Now that Jordan gave you a green light, how would you send the content for Tracey (the stakeholder)?

#### Task 5: Request adjustments to a piece of content thatâ€™s in review

Let's say you are responsible for reviewing content before it gets submitted to stakeholders. Looking at the Coronavirus FAQ page you realized that the number of cases per state didn't get fixed and is still wrong. Using the prototype, how would you point that out to you and request the necessary changes?

#### Task 6: Check on where content is in the editorial process

_Present the prototype for this task_

#### Task 7: Check when changes were last made to content and who made the change

_Present the prototype for this task_

#### Task 8: Check who is responsible for working on this content

#### Task 9: Check to see when the content was last published

## Additional Questions

_About 3 minutes_

That concludes the task portion of this session! I have a few follow-up questions before we wrap up.

* What was your overall impression of the new way to move content through the editorial workflow?

* How could this experience have been improved for you?

* How do you see assignments improving the way you work?

* [Time to ask specific questions regarding the session].

* Is there anything else you'd like to share with us?
