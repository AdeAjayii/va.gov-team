Three intersecting governance systems for the basis of content governance in VA.gov CMS

- [Content creation roles](content-creator-roles.md) determine what content you can create.
- [Content moderation roles](content-moderation-roles.md) (Content Editor, Content Reviewer, Content Publisher) determine where you can move content in the editorial workflow, from Draft -> In Review -> Approved -> Published -> Archived.
- [Sections](sections.md) determine what content you can edit, and where you can “put” content that you create.

All CMS editors have a mix of these three things, with the exception of Content admins, to whom none of these rules apply.
