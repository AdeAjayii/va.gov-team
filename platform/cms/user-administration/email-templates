## Drupal CMS self-service training

Subject: Drupal CMS self-service training now available

Body:

Dear VA CMS editor, 

Welcome to Drupal CMS self-service training. Training is required before you get an account on the production (live) environment.



1. Open a browser to the [training environment](https://cms-training-pion6wlxie1t0mckcgwjl4kid1k1haqe.demo.cms.va.gov/help/access-training#available-trainings) and log in.
*   Username: your VA.gov email address
*   Password: drupal8
*   PIV card login doesn’t work on the training environment.
2. On the CMS help center training page, watch training sessions 1 through 5. When instructed, stop the videos and try the activities.
*   Go as far as you can with each training activity. The training environment is updated more often than the training videos.
*   The training environment isn’t an exact copy of the production environment.
*   The training environment is regularly updated, which deletes training activities.
3. Contact Stan Gardner after watching the training videos and trying the activities in the training environment. He will provide next steps.

Please contact our help desk with any questions or feedback or reply to this email.

Thank you,

## Training for webmaintainers

Subject: Drupal CMS self-service training now available

Body:

Welcome to Drupal CMS training.

**Complete self-service training for Drupal CMS access**

After you have viewed the training videos and completed the related activities in the training environment, your username for the production (live) environment will be created and emailed to you. 

**View training videos**

Start viewing training videos at [https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/access-training#available-trainings](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help/access-training#available-trainings)

Access to CMS environments and CMS help center require VA network access. If you are still waiting for VA network access, you can get a head start on training by viewing the videos on YouTube:

Session 1 The new CMS: [https://youtu.be/33AXrfGff98](https://youtu.be/33AXrfGff98)

Session 2 Editing basics: [https://youtu.be/cnePWZ7rHpo](https://youtu.be/cnePWZ7rHpo)

**Complete training activities**

Your Drupal CMS training environment username has been created for you. Your username is your current email address. Your PIV card will not work for login to the training environment. 

The default password for training environment accounts is drupal8

Access the Drupal CMS training environment at [http://training.demo.ci.cms.va.gov/](http://training.demo.ci.cms.va.gov/)

Because the training environment is not connected to the live site, it is a safe place for you to try training activities and to explore. Please note that the training environment is occasionally updated, which deletes edited information.

**Resources**

Additional training resources are available in the CMS help center: [https://prod.cms.va.gov/help](https://prod.cms.va.gov/help)

Please reply to this email if you have any questions about training. Our help desk can also be reached at [https://va-gov.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3](https://va-gov.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3)

Thank you,

Clarence Maeng, Delivery Manager

## CMS Training Environment Link update

Dear Drupal CMS editor:

You may have mistakenly received an email from us with a link to the Drupal CMS production account. Sorry for the confusion - that email was an error.

We want to let you know that URL for the Drupal CMS training environment is changing. 

Starting **Monday, February 15, 2021**, please use this link for Drupal CMS training activities:

[https://cms-training-pion6wlxie1t0mckcgwjl4kid1k1haqe.demo.cms.va.gov/](https://cms-training-pion6wlxie1t0mckcgwjl4kid1k1haqe.demo.cms.va.gov/)

Please update your training environment bookmark if you saved one on your browser.

Your training environment account will be set up on the new training environment. You will log in with your VA.gov email address for the username and use the default password “drupal8”

The Drupal CMS training environment is temporary. It will be refreshed on a regular basis, and at least every Monday at 9:00 a.m. ET, with the latest content and code from the production (live) environment. Any content created or edited directly in the training environment will be lost during the refresh.

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
