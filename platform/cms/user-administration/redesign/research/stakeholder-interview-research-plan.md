# ~~~WIP~~~ Research Plan for User admin service - stakeholder interview research plan

*VFS-CMS team, May 2021*

## Goals

Learn from VA product stakeholders about how they understand the current CMS user admin process for their product, identify gaps, and explore incoming opportunities and threats to inform the governance structure and service design of the CMS user admin service.

- Get input from at least one relevant stakeholder for each product supported by the CMS, excluding the following products whose needs are currently covered by another product: Media library, Q&A Library, Regional Office, and Cemetary.  


## Background

*Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?*

Currently the CMS team manages user accounts on an ad hoc basis, granting new accounts, changing account permissions, and offboarding users when requests come in. This often involves a lot of back and forth to understand who can verify an account request, what level of permissions to assign, and what other requirements (such as training) might be involved. As the number of CMS users has scaled, increasingly our team (and especially our help desk) has struggled with the lack of structure and cross-product consistency for account governance (who can approve accounts, criteria for onboarding/offoboarding, etc) and service process (defined steps to onboard/offboard accounts).

We believe that redesigning a user admin service should start with undestanding how VA stakeholders understand their role in the account approval process and product user admin policy, and understand any constraints or requirements to refining these items. 


## Research questions

*What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?*
- WIP: Should approval happen at section level in addition to product level? 
- WIP: How many user admin roles are there? Just one user admin or a user admin and a point of contact role?
- Do our terminology words make sense for how we're describing it?
- Ultimate goal/behind the scenes research Q: Does OCTODE have the resources in place to govern user amikn for their productS? Results: user admins and section POCs know why this is important to them and how it works

## Hypothesis

*What is your hypothesis for this research?*

- VA product owners and people serving as the product's user admin would benefit from a more clearly defined process for requesting and verifying user accounts, resulting in CMS onboarding that gets their team members in the system and creating content sooner.
- Conveying the security benefits of a well-defined account offboarding plan may help VA product owners see the value of collaborating with the CMS team on this process.
- While a single user admin role may suffice for many centralized / OCTODE level products, some products with a lot of decentralized/field editors, like VAMCs, may benefit from an additional section-based user admins who can help approve accounts. 
   - For example, the Benefits Hubs product might only need a single role for approving account requests and permissions, while VAMCs might need one product-level role for creating + maintaining the user admin policy, and another set of roles - one per VAMC system - who can verify new account request and permissions.
- While standardizing the process steps for user admin will help streamline our service, each product will need to customize some aspects of their own user admin policy to meet the unique needs.

Method


What method of research are you planning?


Sample Methodologies: Directed interviews; ethnographic interviews; observation; card sorts; tree tests; guerilla usability testing; usability testing with low- or high-fidelity prototypes; user acceptance testing.


Also mention: in-person moderated, remote moderated, remote unmoderated
Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
Where are you planning to do your research? If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)
What will you be testing? (Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)
If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)


Participants and Recruitment


Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)
Please list your participant criteria in two categories-

Primary criteria / Must have - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.)

Secondary criteria / Would like to have - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:

If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc.
What is your recruitment strategy? (If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)
When?
Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? (IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.)
Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)
Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.
Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.
Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?
Team Roles
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker

Moderator:
Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):
Participant recruiting & screening:
Project point of contact:
Participant(s) for pilot test:
Note-takers:
Observers: List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work
