# CMS Help Desk overview

## Principles/vision/mission
The CMS Help Desk is here to ensure that all users of the VA Drupal CMS can get a timely, kind and helpful response to their questions or concerns.

## Our customers
We serve the following customers of the Drupal CMS.

### Engineering and other website team members
Primarily these are served via Slack in the #cms-support channel.

### CMS editors (VAMC)
These currently contact us via VACMSSupport@va.gov and/or the "Contact Help Desk" button on the CMS. We'd prefer to move all incoming contacts to the latter, since it allows us to measure our time to first response accurately and is much easier for help desk to track incoming messages.

### CMS editors (other)
These currently also contact us via VACMSSupport@va.gov and/or the "Contact Help Desk" button on the CMS. We'd prefer to move all incoming contacts to the latter, since it allows us to measure our time to first response accurately and is much easier for help desk to track incoming messages.

### Our SLAs
Service level agreements can be found at [Helpdesk Service Level Agreement](service_level_agreement.md) page.

### How do customers contact us?
Support channels
Users can submit requests which will become a Jira Service Desk ticket by using  a help desk javascript “widget” installed into selected pages in the CMS, to allow users to create support requests, which they can then follow up on via a help desk portal website in which users can create and then track the status of their requests (https://va-gov.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3 ).

Some users may submit requests by other channels (e.g. the pre-existing Slack channel), in which case their requests will be manually redirected, or redirected via Slack integration, to a Jira ticket, in order to keep the interaction properly tracked and recorded. 

When a user requests via the help desk portal, a help desk ticket in Jira Service Desk will be automatically created, and outgoing Slack notifications will result so that help desk staff can be easily notified. 

Incoming help desk requests will be immediately replied to, and a first-response and triage workflow will result.
