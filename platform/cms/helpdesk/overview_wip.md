### How a User Contacts the Help Desk

#### Support Channels 

The CMS Help Desk currently offers three methods for Users to create a case and enter the Help Desk Support Queue to have their Issue resolved. 

**Widget**

A javascript widgetized button is embedded on specific pages throughout the CMS that allows Users to create a Case with the Help Desk. Users can track their Case at https://va-gov.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3 

#### **Slack**

Users may also create a Case with the Help Desk using pre-existing Slack channels.Tier 1 currently is responsible for the timely and periodic review of the Channels for new Cases; and enters all Cases manually by copying and pasting the relevant data into a new Case in JIRA.There is currently no method that tracks which Slack messages are Cases or have been entered in JIRA or had any action(s)There is currently no metric that measures performance, accurately, of messages involving Cases that flow through this channel.

#### **Portal**

Users can create a new Case with the Help Desk using the va.gov website using a form found at https://va-gov.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3 JIRA Cases are created once the User submits the form.  Slack sends immediate notifications to Tier 1 upon Case creation.  Performance of the Portal is measured with metrics and reporting is available that is accurate and is delivered monthly by the Help Desk Manager.

#### **Email**		

The address is a member of a distributed list that is hosted by va.gov.

Tier 1 is responsible for reviewing the mailbox’s incoming e-mail for any new items every 30 minutes between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. EST.

All new Cases must be manually entered into the JIRA system often by copying and pasting the related content from the email to a new Case in JIRA.

There currently is no performance metric that reliably and accurately reports this Support Channel.

The Help Desk is not currently tracking where this email address is being published and shared with Users.

There is currently no real-time, automated notification system to alert Tier 1 when a new Case is created or a User sends an email to the address.

Once a Case enters the Support Channels and is received by Tier 1, Tier 1 is expected to follow the expectation for the Support Channel the Case came through and then follow-up with the User(s) related to the Case with an Initial Response. 

Tier 1’s Initial Response is created by using the “Reply to Customer” feature found at the bottom of the Case notes should be sent no more than 30 minutes after receiving the User’s request. Tier 1’s Initial Response will Acknowledge the User’s issue (often parroting or paraphrasing), Align to the User’s specific situation, and Assure the User the Help Desk is here to help. 

Tier 1 should also ask probing questions to help demonstrate Expertise in the subject matter as well as gather more information to better assist in root cause analysis and in the classification of the severity of the issue.

This should look something similar to, 

> Hello Ero,It looks like you contacted the CMS Help Desk today because of an issue logging into your account over on the Training site for va.gov. You mentioned that you are new to the CMS as well and I can appreciate your eagerness to learn the new tool - we’ve spent a lot of time building it so that our Veteran’s have the best experience with the content you are creating and learning how to use the tools is really important for that to work well! No worries, I’m happy to dive-in here with you. First, I’d like to ask a few questions so that I can get you the best answers and fastest solution, then I’ll put together a quick game plan and for issues like this, we usually have you good-to-go in a few hours but first, can you tell me when the last time you were able to login well was? And, if you recall any new changes to your PC like a software update or …? Thanks for taking the time to dive on those questions, I’ll be looking for your reply and when you do I will review what you share and get back to you right away with those next steps.

> Cheers for now,	Tier 1



#### Tier 1 Help desk Agents’ Responsibilities

The Tier 1 Help Desk is responsible for any Issues related to User How-to questions that may include questions about how-to edit, manage, publish, or alter their VA Medical Center’s Public Website, and question about the use any of the CMS’ built-in features such as Password Reset, Governance, Permissions, and Content related features. 

Tier 1 also provides assistance to Training both internally and externally to various requests, and to the various Product Owners and Managers and their various requests as it relates to the CMS. Tier 1 also manages the incoming Support Channel queues by:

Ensure that first responses are delivered to any new Issue between 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. EST

Any In Progress Issues are being actively worked on and resolved in accordance with the time constraints for the Issue’s Priority. 

Escalate any Issue not in scope by engaging the Slack channel  #cms-product-triagePost the issue to the Slack channel and solicit feedback from Product Owners, Managers, Developers, and Engineers.

Warm Transfer Ownership after gaining agreement on the specific Tier 2 Product Owner, or Manager, Developer, or engineer taking Lead leave notes with that same information on the Case.

Ensure that next-steps are taken to create Tier 2 tickets, and convey appropriate requests for assistance from the development team, as needed.

Respond appropriately to follow up on any open tickets.

Ensure that all open Tier 1 tickets are resolved appropriately.

Ensure that any Incidents are reported/escalated immediately, and serve as Incident Commander until/unless an appropriate team member takes over that role

#### Tier 2 Responsibilities

Tier 2 staff consists of engineers, product owners, and developers. 

The scope of their support involves all issues involving defects (critical and non-critical), feature requests, or enhancements. Additionally, Tier 2 will:

Provide Tier 1 with technical information to aid in root cause analysis.

Take ownership of Issues that fall within the scope of Tier 2.

Respond immediately to any Incident reported through the Support Channels and serve as Incident Commander as needed.

#### **The Help desk Manager** 

Review and revise processes and procedures.

Provide stakeholders with reports related to the Help Desk’s performance. 

#### **The Delivery Manager**	

Prioritizes Tier 2 backlog queue.

#### Types of requests

##### User How-tos or User Error

The most common Issue.

Often can be resolved with Tier 1 Enhancement or Feature Requests

Tier 1 will meet and review the Issue with Tier 2. 

Tier 2 will determine if Ownership of the Issue is necessary and create a Github ticket within the backlog. 

The Delivery Manager should be notified after the ticket is created schedule the request for completion in the Tier 2 Backlog

For any follow-up or clarifying questions Tier 1 may be asked to engage the User or Tier 2 may, Ownership of the Issue does not necessarily absolve Tier 1 from the Issue.

Tier 1 may follow-up independently of Tier 2 and notify the User of any updates until the Issue is resolved. Once the enhancement request is well-understood, the next step is to create a Github ticket, add it to the backlog, and bring it to the attention of the Delivery Manager.

#### Defects

Tier 1 will escalate all Critical and Non-Critical Defects to Tier 2.Content questions that require assistance from VA staff
