# CMS Collaboration cycle kickoff request
Before engaging with the CMS Collaboration Cycle, please review the guidance and questions below to help the CMS team determine what level of support, which practice areas, and which touchpoints are needed for your work. If you don’t know the answer to a question, then it’s too early for you to engage with the CMS Collaboration Cycle.

**Are you ready to engage with the Collaboration Cycle?**

If yes, then your Product Manager should submit the [CMS Collaboration Cycle Request ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/new?assignees=BerniXiongA6&labels=CMS+Team%2C+Needs+Analysis%2C+CMS-Collab-Cycle%2C+Epic&projects=&template=cms-collaboration-cycle-request.yml&title=CMS+Collaboration+Cycle+for+%5BTeam+Name%2C+Product+Name%2C+Feature+Name%5D) and answer the kickoff questions. We'll update that Epic with recommended touchpoints and respond in the Slack post that you create.

## Questions about your product or feature:
If you need more information about how to answer some of the questions that are asked in the kickoff ticket, you can find that below. These questions help us determine which practice areas to involve on the CMS team and which touchpoints that we recommend to your team.

## Are you doing user research with CMS editors?

We ask this question to determine if a research review is necessary.

Examples of research with CMS Editors include:

- Usability testing
- User surveys
- Card sorting
  
   
## Will your work result in visible changes to the user experience of the CMS?

Examples of **visible changes** include:

- Any changes that the user will see
- Adding a new form, tool, or page
- Modifying buttons, design elements, interactions, or page layouts
- Reordering content, adding new calls to action, alert boxes, expandable sections, or error messages

Examples of **no visible changes** include:

- Changes to code that the user won’t see
- Changes to accessible labels (aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby)
   
## Will your work require introducing a new Drupal module or changes to an existing module?


## Do you need to capture any analytics or metrics?


## Will this work require creating/editing any CMS Knowledge Base articles?
