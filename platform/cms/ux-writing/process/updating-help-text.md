# Updating help text (WIP)
1. UX writer edits help text in onhelptext.demo.ci.cms.va.go environment. Use Fieldhelptext module as needed for efficent batch updates.
2. UX writer adds any notes to the notes column in the [Drupal Spec Tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vL8rqLqcEVfESnJJK_GWQ7nf3BPe4SSevYYblisBTOI/edit#gid=943298572)
3. UX writer asks a developer to merge changes from the onhelptext demo environment [should I add a ticket for this? / what's the workflow in ZH?]
4. [TK: steps developer would need to take]
5. [TK: something about updating the Drupal spec tool?]
