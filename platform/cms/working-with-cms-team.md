## <a id="whentorequest"></a>When to check-in/collaborate with CMS team

CMS support is available anytime you have questions or want to collaborate on your work, so don't hesitate to reach out at any time. You will find more information on the CMS Collaboration Cycle on the internal team [Confluence] (https://va-gov.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/VAGOV/pages/1791459333/CMS+Collaboration+Cycle). 

### For product designers and managers

**At project kick-off** 
- If your project involves non-authenticated (public) content, it is helpful to get a high level overview of the CMS and its products. 
- Reach out to the CMS team in https://dsva.slack.com/archives/CT4GZBM8F for a CMS Collaboration Cycle Kickoff [ticket] (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/new?assignees=ewashb%2Cdawnpruitt&labels=%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F+Sitewide+CMS&template=cms-collab-intake.yml&title=%5BCMS+COLLAB+CYCLE+INTAKE%5D+%28Team+Name%2C+Product+Name%2C+Feature+Name%29).

**During Discovery** 
- If your product's content may be managed within the Drupal CMS, schedule a CMS Collaboration Cycle Kickoff meeting, around the same time as the <a href="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/working-with-platform-design-team.md#design-intent-check-in">design intent review</a>. 

**During Design and Development** 
- If your product involves additions to the content model and/or the editorial experience, please involve the CMS team through the CMS collaboration cycle. Your designs will need a kickoff where it will be determined if there is additional need for a midpoint review.   

**Staging Review** 
- If your product involved changes to the Drupal interface, you will be required to add a CMS developer for code review as well as a CMS designer for design review in your PR. If you are unsure of who to assign the review, please reach out in the team slack #sitewide-cms-platform.


**Orientation**
