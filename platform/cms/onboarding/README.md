# Welcome to the VFS-CMS Team! ðŸ‘‹
We're thrilled to have you join us on this journey! ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

Our vision is to build and maintain a best-in-class Content Management System that meets the needs of editors, application development teams, and consuming applications in order to empower our users to help Veterans.

We ask that you create a GitHub issue using [this template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/cms-team-member-onboarding.md) which will walk you through the steps needed to onboard.

Have fun and we look forward to getting to know you! ðŸ˜Š
