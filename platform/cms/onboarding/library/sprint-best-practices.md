# VFS-CMS sprint best practices

## Purpose
This document is designed to capture best practices around how the VFS-CMS team approaches each two week sprint and leverages various applications throughout.

## Capacity planning
Before the start of each sprint, team members are expected to go into their respective team’s tab (“Core Team” or “Product Support Team”) on this sheet and enter the number of available days for the sprint.

The default is eight, which translates to eight working days per two week period, and accounts for two days of sprint ceremonies, code review, context switching, and general meetings. Holidays, PTO, and OOO should be accounted for by subtracting one point for each day unavailable. Adding a note to give information on why points were subtracted is appreciated but not required.

The “Summary” tab will convert those days into the team’s total point capacity based on the velocity of the last three sprints (Summary tab, row 14, “V Factor”). This total is the recommended number of points that the team should take on for the next sprint (row 10, “Suggested Goal”).

## Scrum
Team scrums are a vital component of keeping the team connected and informed. The cadence may vary per team but the intent is the same: sharing how you’re doing overall, what you’re working on, and if you have any questions or blockers.

1. Try to keep your update < one minute. Anything that needs to take longer to talk through can be put on as a “16th minute” or moved to a slack thread or separate conversation. We generally try to timebox updates at 15 minutes and leave any other topics for the “16th minute” list.
2. Give your personal [“balance score”](https://medium.com/civicactions/improving-scrum-team-flow-on-digital-service-projects-6723d95eaad8#:~:text=Balance%20is%20about%20self-recognition%20of%20our%20own%20priorities,real%20understanding%20of%20the%20constraints%20of%20our%20situations.) for the day. This is meant to be a quick snapshot into how balanced you’re feeling mentally, spiritually, emotionally, physically, and professionally. We score on a scale of 1-10, with 1 being completely unbalanced and 10 being completely balanced.
3. Use the board during scrum to keep it as updated as possible in regards to status and comments.
