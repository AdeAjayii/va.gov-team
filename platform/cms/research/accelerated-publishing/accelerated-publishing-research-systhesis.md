# Participant Description

- 6 CMS editors:
  - 2 VAMC field editors 
  - 1 VAMC Upgrade Team member
  - 2 Sitewide Content team members
  - 1 VACO stakeholder


# Key Findings

List summary Info here. 3 to 4 bullet points. Consider adding research goals and putting relevant findings under each goal.

1. Poor publishing UX: The CMS interface doesn’t tell editors when their content will go live.
2. Faster = better*: Most editors believed that quicker publishing would benefit their work as long as it didn’t negatively impact complexities with deployments and cross-linked content.
3. Delay = inefficiency + stress: Publishing delays force editors to manage extra coordination and stress in delivering quality content on time.
4. Emergencies happen: A handful of somewhat common situations put particular pressure on editors who are responsible for delivering content to Veterans quickly.
