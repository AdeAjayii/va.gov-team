## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We really appreciate you taking the time to talk with us! 
Today we're going to talk about your experience using three new forms in the CMS - billing & insurance, medical records, and register for care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take 30 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We just want to improve these tools to better meet the needs of site editors and of Veterans. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.We will keep your comments anonymous.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
  * Start recording.
  * I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Interview Questions 

### Intro

* What’s your role at the VA? 
* How long have you been in this role?
* What are your responsibilities for the website?

### Announcement email 

To start, I’d like to hear your take on the emails explaining this project. The first thing editors will receive is an email from VHA digital media announcing this change. It will come one week before the project launches.
 
* Having done this work, what do you think is most important to communicate to editors before the project starts? 

### Instructions email 

Another email will come out on the day of the launch. You received a draft of this email – it contains instructions for how to do the updates, as well as the deadline for the work.   I’m going to share my screen to remind you what it looked like. [share screen] 

* What did you think or feel when you received this email?
* Any suggestions to help editors understand what’s being asked of them?
* After reading the email, what was the first thing that you did? 
* How did you decide when to do this work? 
* Is your supervisor aware of this work? How does it fit in with your other projects?
* Would it be helpful to get reminder emails? 
 
### Training

For training, you had access to Knowledge Base articles and training videos that were linked in the instruction email. [share KB article if needed]

* How did you use the training materials? 
* About how long did you spend with the training?
* Was there anything that was confusing? 
* What was most helpful? 
 
### CMS forms / workflow
[screenshare, logged in as them in staging]
I’m logged into the CMS as you. This is not the live site–I can’t make any changes, so don’t worry. This is just to have a visual aid. 
Once you logged in to Drupal CMS …

* How did you find the forms that you needed to edit?
* [go to edit medical records office] - looking at the labels on this page, was it clear how to add a location? 
* Are the forms missing anything to capture the correct info for your VAMC? 
* How did you gather the address and hours information you needed?
* How long did it take you to make these changes? 

[if time - repeat for billing and insurance]

## Closing

We’re almost at the end of our time. Before we close, 

* [notetaker] do you have anything you wanted to follow up on?
* [Participant], do you have any questions for us? 

Thank you so much for sharing your feedback. It will help us make sure that this update process goes smoothly for all VAMC editors. We will keep you posted about the timeline and let you know when the changes are live and you can publish the new pages.
