# Research Plan for VFS-CMS, November 2020

## Goals
This research plan is for the VFS-CMS - VFS-CMS team.

The VFS-CMS is VA.gov's content management system that provides the structured content templates, workflows and governance that help various teams at VA serve veterans accurate, accessible, up-to-date content.

Our objective for this research is to **gather first impressions about the Claro Admin UI and identify opportunities to mitigate impacts during the transition from the current Drupal design system to Claro Admin UI**. 

#### Solution Hypothesis
...

#### Research Questions
* ...

#### What knowledge will make us feel like the research process has been successful?
Developing an uderstanding of how Claro Admin UI impacts people's experiences in the CMS will show our research process has been successful. In particular, if adjustments to general UI elements needed to be made in order to mitigate the transition to this design system.

## Method	

**What method of research are you planning?**
20-minute remote _5 Second Test_, combined with moderated usability test to have users perform relevant tasks in the context of the Claro Admin UI. 

This session will not be recorded. We'll use verbatim notes to register the session, followed by synthesized notes on our observations.

**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?**
We chose the _5 Second Test_ because it is used to capture the first impressions users have of designs within the first five seconds of exposure to it. In order to gather complementary insights, we'll ask participants to perform relevant tasks in the context of Claro Admin UI's look and feel.

**Where are you planning to do your research?**
Online, via Zoom. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

**What will you be testing?**
Demo environment with Claro Admin UI installed.
