# WIP ---- > Inline Guidance Research Plan for Sitewide CMS team, April 2022

## Product info

Team: Sitewide CMS team
Product: Drupal content management system (CMS)


## Background

CMS content editors tasked with delivering quality, Veteran-centered VA.gov content face many challenges, such as:
- They have to wait to see what their content will look like because the CMS is decoupled from the front end
- Rules and guidelines for their content may be coming from multiple parts of the organization (such as overall content style guidelines as well as product-specific rules) and may be located in multiple locations outside the CMS
- They may need extra guidelines because they lack digital content management experience
- They may use the CMS infrequently and therefore have a hard time recalling training and other guidance.

**Problem we're trying to solve**

Give editors the guidance they need, where they need it, without adding to the existing clutter in the UI.

### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? 

- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
- Platform users can build and deploy high-quality products for Veterans

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

The study only has indirect relevance to the Veteran journey.

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 
1. Interaction design: Understand if CMS editors can successfully use the inline guidance component as intended.
2. Value: Understand if the inline guidance design component reduces effort it takes editors to find and use guidance.

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

**Ideal outcomes**
- Editors get guidance in the place they need it without going to the extra effort of search the knowledge base or other resources
- Fewer CMS Help Desk tickets about rules and guidelines
- Better compliance with rules and guidelines, therefore increase in content quality
- Editors feel more empowered to complete their content tasks
- Concepts introduced in training get reinforced in the UI

**What we'll do with our learnings**
- Inform how / whether we proceed with building the inline guidance component into the CMS interface
- If hypotheses are supported:
   - Apply the inline guidance component to one content type to start (name content type here)
   - Revisit in X months and assess whether to apply to additional content types.
- If hypothesis are not supported:
   - Followup discovery to understand the best way to serve guidance to editors.

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

Goal 1: interaction design
- To what extent is the component noticable to editors? How many choose to open it without prompting?
- To what extent is the additional info / collapsible design of the component effective in the context of the CMS?
- Is the component contextualized correctly? Do editors understand that it applies to the given field?
- How effective is the component label?
- Do editors choose to close the component after reading?

Goal 2: value
- Is the content inside the collapsible element designed effectively?
- What might be missing from the content? What parts are unnecessary?
- Do editors prefer using this component over the KB or other resources?
- Are screenshots / images effective here?


### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

* Editors prefer to access guidance inline over going to external resources
* Guidance is most effect when it is opt-in so as not to slow the experience for experienced users
* Guidance content is most effective when kept to short summaries



## Method	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

Usability testing (Semi-structured, moderated)
Part 1: User context and experience with the CMS
Part 2: Inline guidance component
Part 3: Alternative designs
   - Help text only
   - Help text with links out to the KB


### Location

Conducted remotely via Zoom


### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

## Recruitment	


### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Our intended audience is VAMC editors because we believe they stand to benefit most from additional guidance. We plan to recurit them with the support of VHA digital media. 

Recuritment process
1. Identify 10 or so potential participants, possibly based on past interest in CMS research studies
2. Reach out to participant pool through email. Ideally VHA would support by either sending the email out or serving as a cc to help encourage participation.
3. Confirm participation with Calendly
4. Repeat recuritment reach outs as necessary
5. Conduct interviews
6. Send thank you followup comms


Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

- Number: 5-10 editors
- Product: VAMC
- Experience level: a diversity of experience levels
- Onboarding status: but all should have already gone through training and gotten to work in the CMS independently for at least a few weeks.

### Length of sessions
