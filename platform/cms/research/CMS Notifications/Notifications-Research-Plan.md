# (WIP)Editor-facing Research Plan for Sitewide CMS Notifications - November 2022

This final research plan is published in the [CMS research repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/research) and in the [UX research airtable](https://airtable.com/appmAWA5qxKq9qxFX/tbldzfPsD87QtCmQK/viwFTiq16RNmlQ3GM?blocks=hide).

## Background
This research plan comes from 6102 which aims to update outdated content. Editors will be required to review their content yearly to ensure that information is still relevant. Any outdated content will need to be either updated or removed to comply with 6102. Since editors will potentially need to be notified of a variety of things, we need to figure out the best way to notify them of action items.

## OCTO Objectives 
This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) 

### Office of the CTO (OCTO) North Stars
- Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

### Mission
- Continuously deliver high-quality digital experiences for the benefit of all Veterans and their families.

### Goals
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov

### Numbers
#### Increase
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov
#### Decrease
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
- Time from online benefit discovery to benefit delivery

## Research Goals	
What are we trying to learn from this research?

- Gain a better understanding of how editors would like to receive notifications.
- Gain a better understanding of the things that editors want to be notified of.
- Gain a better understanding of what pain points editors are currently experiencing when receiving relevant information or action items.

### Outcome
The results of this research will be used to develop a future direction for how to inform CMS editors about any relevant information or action items and provide an easy way to directly access the content in order to act on the notification.

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

Reframe these as questions:
- Gain a better understanding of how editors would like to receive notifications.
- Gain a better understanding of the things that editors want to be notified of.
- Gain a better understanding of what pain points editors are currently experiencing when receiving relevant information or action items.

### Hypothesis
Outdated content on VA websites can easily lead to information that doesn't match the operational reality of VA facilities. Veterans trust that the information on VA websites will be accurate and up to date, but when that is not the case veterans will be confused which could potentially lead to a mistrust of the information that is on VA websites.

When the VA is able to notify editors of relevant information in a timely manner that fits into their established workflow, editors will be more likely to use the CMS efficiently. When editors are notified of relevant information or action items and are able to easily access the content, they're less likely to make errors and more likely to follow veteran-centered content guidelines which yield higher quality content for veterans on VA.gov.

CMS notifications will provide a way for us to speak to the editors directly and let them know when information needs to be updated and where. Allowing for a centralized place for all different types of CMS notifications will also provide a flexible space to expand the types of notifications that we send editors if there is a need for that in the future.


## Method	
Potential research methods include the following. Should we just focus on one or can we include multiple as part of the same research plan since we're looking to include prototypes.

- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
- Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
- User acceptance testing (UAT) - required before product release

### Location
Remote via Zoom

### Research materials
Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Intended audience for this research: Editors
How we recruit them: Erika sent out a survey to willing participants. Need more info on this. 

Use snowball sampling when working with VA employees. At the end of our study:

- Ask key informant if thereâ€™s anyone else they know that they would recommend us to talk to.
- Ask if they can introduce us to them or if we can CC them on an email for credibility on contact.


### Recruitment criteria

Number of participants: 5

Experience, geographic location, and scenarios of participants

Not surveyed in the past.

Someone from every facility type.
- VBA
- VAMC
- Vet Center

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is optional. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: TBD

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 30 minutes
