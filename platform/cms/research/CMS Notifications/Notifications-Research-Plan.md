# (WIP)Editor-facing research Plan for Sitewide CMS Notifications - November 2022

This final researh plan is published in the [CMS research repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/research) and in the [UX research airtable](https://airtable.com/appmAWA5qxKq9qxFX/tbldzfPsD87QtCmQK/viwFTiq16RNmlQ3GM?blocks=hide).

## Background
This research plan comes from 6102 which aims to update outdated content. Editors will be required to review their content yearly to ensure that information is still relevant. Any outdated content will need to be either updated or removed to comply with 6102. Since editors will potentially need to be notified of a variety of things, we need to figure out the best way to notify them of action items.

## OCTO Objectives 
This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) 

### Office of the CTO (OCTO) North Stars
- Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

### Mission
- Continuously deliver high-quality digital experiences for the benefit of all Veterans and their families.

### Goals
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov

### Numbers
#### Increase
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov
#### Decrease
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
- Time from online benefit discovery to benefit delivery

## Research Goals	
What are we trying to learn from this research?

- Gain a better understanding of how editors would like to receive notifications.
- Gain a better understanding of the things that editors want to be notified of.
- Gain a better understanding of what painpoints editors are currently experiencing when receiving relevant information or action items.

### Outcome
The results of this research will be used to develop a future direction for how to inform CMS editors about any relevant information or action items and provide an easy way to directly access the content in order to act on the notification.

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

Reframe these as questions:
-Gain a better understanding of how editors would like to receive notifications.
-Gain a better understanding of the things that editors want to be notified of.
-Gain a better understanding of what painpoints editors are currently experiencing when receiving relevant information or action items.

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

Outdated content on VA websites can easily lead to information that doesn't match the operational reality of VA facilities. Veterans trust that the information on VA websites will be accurate and up to date, but when that is not the case veterans will be confused which could potentially lead to a mistrust of the the information that is on VA websites.

When the VA is able to notify editors of relevant information in a timely manner that fits into their established workflow, editors will be more likely to use the CMS efficienty. When editors are notified of relevant information or action items and are able to easily access the content, they're less likely to make errors and more likely to follow veteran-centered content guidelines which yeilds higher quality content for veterans on VA.gov.

CMS notifications will provide a way for us to speak to the editors directly and let them know when information needs to be updated and where. Allowing for a centralized place for all different types of CMS notifications will also provide a flexible space to expand the types of notifications that we send editors if there is a need for that in the future.


## Method	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

Examples of common research methods include: 
- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
- Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
- User acceptance testing (UAT) - required before product release

### Location
Remote via Zoom

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), research recruitment with Veterans. However, you must handle recuitment yourself for research with editors. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Intended audience for this research: Editors
How will we recruit them? Erika sent out a survey to willing participants.

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

Number of participants:

Experience, geographic location, and scenarios of particpants

Someone from every facility type.
-VBA
-VAMC
-What else?

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is optional. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.
