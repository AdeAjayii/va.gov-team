# (WIP)Editor-facing research Plan for Sitewide CMS Notifications - November 2022

This final researh plan is published in the [CMS research repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/cms/research) and in the [UX research airtable](https://airtable.com/appmAWA5qxKq9qxFX/tbldzfPsD87QtCmQK/viwFTiq16RNmlQ3GM?blocks=hide).

## Background
This research plan comes from 6102 which aims to update outdated content. Editors will be required to review their content yearly to ensure that information is still relevant. Any outdated content will need to be either updated or removed to comply with 6102. 

### OCTO Objectives 
This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) 

## Office of the CTO (OCTO) North Stars
- Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

## Mission
Continuously deliver high-quality digital experiences for the benefit of all Veterans and their families.

## Goals
1. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
1. Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov

## Numbers
### Increase
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov
### Decrease
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
- Time from online benefit discovery to benefit delivery

## Research Goals	
What are we trying to learn from this research?
(Reframe these questions as statements.)
-How would editors like to receive notifications? Email? Within the CMS? Both? Other?
-What are some other things that editors could be notified (or would like to be notified of) once notifications for 6102 are implemented?
-Would a dashboard out outdated content be beneficial?
-How do we keep editors from editing over one another?

### Outcome
How will this research advance our product to the next phase in the design process? What will we do with our learnings?

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

Outdated content on VA websites leads to....?


## Method	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

Examples of common research methods include: 
- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
- Contextual inquiry - appropriate for generative research
- Card sorts - appropriate for generative and evaluative research; depending on the study design 
- Tree tests - appropriate for evaluative research
- Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
- User acceptance testing (UAT) - required before product release

### Location
Where will you be holding the research sessions? Be sure to include whether this is remote or in-person research. [Learn more about setting up in-person research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/planning-in-person-research.md)

If remote, include your preferred video conferencing software. Choice of: Zoom, GoTo Meeting; WebEx.

If in person, include:
- Location
- Point of contact
- Equipment used for research

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), research recruitment with Veterans. However, you must handle recuitment yourself for research with editors. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Intended audience for this research: Editors
How will we recruit them? Erika sent out a survey to willing participants.

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria

Number of participants:

Experience, geographic location, and scenarios of particpants

Someone from every facility type.
