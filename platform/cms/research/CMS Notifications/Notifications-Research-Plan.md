# Editor-facing Research Plan for Sitewide CMS Notifications - November 2022

This final research plan is published in the [CMS Research Repo](https://airtable.com/appmAWA5qxKq9qxFX/tbldzfPsD87QtCmQK/viwFTiq16RNmlQ3GM?blocks=hide) and in the [UX research airtable](https://airtable.com/appmAWA5qxKq9qxFX/tbldzfPsD87QtCmQK/viwFTiq16RNmlQ3GM?blocks=hide).

## Background
This research is to provide product requirements for the [MVP Epic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/10477) in response to [VA Directive 6102](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.va.gov/vapubs/viewPublication.asp?Pub_ID%3D1056%26FType%3D2&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1668727018626949&usg=AOvVaw0GMUCcz3wCLL1HcSL_TzhS) which aims to update outdated content on VA websites. This directive requires that CMS editors review their content yearly to ensure that information is still relevant. Any outdated content will need to be either updated or removed to comply with Directive 6102.

Outdated content on VA websites can easily lead to information that doesn't match the operational reality of VA facilities. Veterans trust that the information on VA websites will be accurate and up to date, but when that is not the case veterans will be confused which could potentially lead to a mistrust of the information that is on VA websites.

When the VA is able to notify editors of relevant information in a timely manner that fits into their established workflow, editors will be more likely to use the CMS efficiently. When editors are notified of relevant information or action items and are able to easily access the content, they're less likely to make errors and more likely to follow veteran-centered content guidelines which yield higher quality content for veterans on VA.gov.

Since editors will potentially need to be notified of a variety of things beyond 6102, we need to figure out the best way to notify them of action items. CMS notifications will provide a way for us to speak to the editors directly and let them know when information needs to be updated and where. Allowing for a centralized place for all different types of CMS notifications will also provide a flexible space to expand the types of notifications that we send editors if there is a need for that in the future.

## OCTO Objectives 
This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme). 

### North Star
- Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

### Mission
- Continuously deliver high-quality digital experiences for the benefit of all Veterans and their families.

### Goals
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov

### Numbers
* Increase
  * Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov  
* Decrease
  * Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution  
  * Time from online benefit discovery to benefit delivery 

## Research Goals

### What we're trying to learn:

- Gain a better understanding of how notifications could fit into the editors current workflow.
- Gain a better understanding of what types of notifications would help editors to better serve veterans.
- Gain a better understanding of what pain points editors are currently experiencing when receiving relevant information or action items.

### Outcome
The results of this research will be used to develop a future direction for how to inform CMS editors about any relevant information or action items and provide an easy way to directly access the content in order to act on the notification.

### Research questions
* How familiar are editors with VA Directive 6102?
* What pain points are editors currently experiencing when receiving information or action items from the VA about updates needed in the CMS?
* Which notification format would be most effective in driving editors to take action within the CMS?
  * Email Notifications
  * Notifications within the CMS
  * A combination of both
* Once 6102 notifications are implemented, what are some other things we can notify editors of that will directly benefit veterans accessing VA content?

### Hypothesis
* Editors are familiar with Directive 6102.
* Editors are juggling many competing priorities and only work on their websites when there is a pressing need.
* Notifications can help editors become 6102 compliant.
* Too many notifications will defeat the purpose of having them and we should be judicious with the use of them.
* Our prototype email conveys all the information an editor needs to fix outdated content.

## Method

### Type
We will use semi-structured interviews to conduct generative research.

### Location
Remote via Zoom

### Research materials  
- [Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/cms/research/CMS%20Notifications/Moderated-Interviews-Conversation-Guide.md) (Coming next sprint)
- Email mockup (Coming next sprint)

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Intended audience for this research: Editors
How we recruit them: Erika sent out a survey to willing participants. Need more info on this. 

Use snowball sampling when working with VA employees. At the end of our study:

- Ask key informant if thereâ€™s anyone else they know that they would recommend us to talk to.
- Ask if they can introduce us to them or if we can CC them on an email for credibility on contact.


### Recruitment criteria

Number of participants: 5

Experience, geographic location, and scenarios of participants

Not surveyed in the past.

Someone from every facility type.

### Prepare
A pilot session is optional. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.
