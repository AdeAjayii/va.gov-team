# Vet Centers MVP - usability study results

## Hypothesis

- A task-based dashboard streamlines content findability and task efficiency.
- Bringing together visitor-facing and organizational language reinforces editors to make decisions that serve the VC audience.
- Graphics on cards serve as cues to help with FE recognition on the BE.
- It is valuable for local editors to be able to have national context on the form.
- The pattern designed for editable and non-editable content is clear to editors.
- Proper spacing and grouping of content enhances content readibility.
- Matching the the front-end sequence streamlines content findability.

## Findings by hypothesis

**A task-based dashboard streamlines content findability and task efficiency.**
- True. Participants understood that each section of the dashboard was related to information Veterans see and that they can edit.

>"Looks super easy, user friendly and easy to work with."
 
>"It’s broken down pretty well to be able to fill in specific areas, specific content related to my vet centers day to day operations."

**Bringing together visitor-facing and organizational language reinforces editors to make decisions that serve the VC audience.**
- Still needs further investigation.

**Graphics on cards serve as cues to help with FE recognition on the BE.**
- Mostly true. No upfront comment was made about the graphics. Researcher had to ask about them. 

>"It does - it gives me an idea of what to expect when going into that section."

>"I see the idea. Structurally, how the page is framed out. As far as individual sentences vs info that’s more like a block or list."

>"I don’t recognize those symbols at all. I would guess that they’re associated with their sections, but the only one I remember at all is the featured content one. It seems fairly straightforward to me."

**It is valuable for local editors to be able to have national context on the form.**
- True. Participants saw value in having national content available on the forms.

>"Yes, if it needs to be updated, at least I could visualize it, and we’d contact them if something has to change."

>"It’s important that we be able to see that [national content] in case there’s a mistake, or something isn’t updated. I don’t consider it to be annoying or anything like that."

**The pattern designed for editable and non-editable content is clear to editors.**
- Partially true. By exclusion, participants understood that they could only edit some content blocks.

>"I noticed the pencil but didn’t really notice the question mark. Right off the bat I think there’s things I can control and things I can't. And the question mark would tell me more."

>"I noticed - at the local i wouldn’t have the ability to edit. The question mark is like, “nice try buddy!”

>"Question mark looks like you have that locked down. Don’t want us editing that kind of stuff."

**Proper spacing and grouping of content enhances content readibility.**
- Participants scanned through the form several times voicing each block in order to find content. There were no hesitations regarding they way content was visually organized.

**Matching the the front-end sequence streamlines content findability.**
- People started to recognize on the form the sequence of information displayed on the front-end, e.g. order of operating status field didn't make sense for people.

## Key findings summary
- The dashboard provided clarity to editors about where information could be found.
- Most participants were not so sure about what "Link Text" meant on the Featured Content modal.
- Visitors are seen as clients or contacts, which caused some confusion about the content under "Visitor Information".
- Some participants interpreted "Page Intro" field as being part of the operating status update flow.
- Phone number and hours of operation were associated with "visitor information".
- Some participants were not certain about how the operating status information would show up on the front-end.
- People understood that work done in a modal wasn't automatically saved, and that they needed to go to the bottom of the form to save their work.
- One participant pointed out that w/ operating status, when they get down to normal hours, that could get problematic, since some individual centers might have hours outside of that.
- One participant considered MVC to be a service, not a location, therefore they were likely to search for that information in "Services."
- "Jump" feature was said to be helpful when it comes to find content on the form.
- Editors valued being able to see VAST data in the form so they could verify that is it is correct.

## Recommendations

- Use a different label for "Link text" (e.g. Hyperlink) and reinforce the explanation with examples.
- Keep presenting national content on the forms.
- Provide as much guidance as possible about what to do in case of questions regarding national information.
- Display information about when national content was last updated.
- Differentiate main VC from other locations.
- Add "scroll to top" functionality to the forms.
- Provide visual cue regarding content that was updated, but not saved.
- Adjust "Visitor information" label and/or be specific about what information is to be edited on this category.
- Make it clear that changing the operating status does not influence Location and Contact information information.
- Remove this information from the operating status flow or place Operating Status on its own block.
- Clarify what is there to edit when it comes to services at a VC.
