# ~~ WIP Research Plan for Acclerated Publishing discovery ~~
VFS-CMS team, April 2021

## Goals

*What product & team are you doing this research for?*

The goal of this study is to understand what kinds of needs, painpoints, or expectations exist among CMS editors that might impact the technical solution for accelerated publishing.

**Background**

*Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?*

Currently, the technical architecture that supports CMS content being pushed to VA.gov causes a publishing delay. When a CMS editor saves content as published, there is a X hour delay before it goes live on VA.gov. We believe that rearchitecting the deployment process to reduce or eliminate delays will result in a better experience for editors and ultimately, Veterans.

**Research questions**

*What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?*

- How quickly do users expect their content appear on VA.gov after saving as published?
- What kinds of time pressures exist for various users and products when trying to get their content out there?
- Where do editors experience confusion or difficulty in the current publishing workflow?
- How do the proofing page and preview features enhance or impede the current publishign workflow?
- Would a scheduled publishing feature change users' needs for accelerating publishing? 

**Hypothesis**

*What is your hypothesis for this research?*
- A significant number of CMS editors expect the application to perform like commercial content publishing applications, such as Wordpress or even Facebook.
- The current publishing delay is a problem for a significant number of editors working with timely content, such as banner alerts, news releases, or content related to a new policy.
- The option to schedule publishing would greatly improve some editor's workflow and help them accomplish their content goals.
- The CMS application's proofing page and preview features only partially mitigate the need for better system feedback in the interface.


## Method

*What method of research are you planning?*

**User interviews** with a walkthrough of the current publishing workflow. This will help us identify where the users' content goals intersect with the interface as they go through the publishing workflow (Start in edit form > save as published > review proofing page).  
- Moderated study conducted remotely via Zoom
- We will test the current interface with additional interview questions to understand the users's context and content goals.


## Participants and Recruitment
Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)
Please list your participant criteria in two categories-

Primary criteria / Must have - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.)

Secondary criteria / Would like to have - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:

If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc.
What is your recruitment strategy? (If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)
When?

## Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? (IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.)
- Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)
- Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.
- Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.
- Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?


## Team Roles
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker

**Moderator:**
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):
- Participant recruiting & screening:
- Project point of contact:
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Note-takers:
- Observers: List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work
