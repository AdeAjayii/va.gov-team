# ~~ WIP Research Plan for Acclerated Publishing discovery ~~
VFS-CMS team, April 2021

## Goals

*What product & team are you doing this research for?*

The goal of this study is to understand what kinds of needs, painpoints, or expectations exist among CMS editors that might inform the technical solution for accelerated publishing.

**Background**

*Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?*

Currently, the technical architecture that supports CMS content being pushed to VA.gov causes a publishing delay. When a CMS editor saves content as published, there is a 1 hour delay before it goes live on VA.gov. The CMS team is currently exploring how to rearchitect the deployment process to reduce or eliminate delays. We believe that better understanding the needs and painpoints for CMS editors across the VA ecosystem will help inform a technical solution that improves CMS editor's work. 

**Research questions**

*What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?*

- How quickly do users currently expect/understand that their content will appear on VA.gov after saving as published?
- What kinds of pressure do users experience that impact when they need their content to go live on VA.gov? (e.g. stakeholders, etc)
- How does delayed publishing currently impact users' work?
- If the publishing delay were reduced to 30, 20, or 10 minutes, what kind of impact would editors expect on their work?
- What painpoints in the current publishing workflow may be compounding our editor's experience of delayed publishing?
- How do the proofing page and preview features enhance or impede the current publishing workflow?
- Might a scheduled publishing feature mitigate users' needs for accelerating publishing? 

**Hypothesis**

*What is your hypothesis for this research?*

- A significant number of CMS editors expect the application to publish instantly, similar to their experience with commercial content publishing applications, such as Wordpress or social media platforms.
- Despite good training, the "decoupled" idea and the idea of a delay may be difficult to retain for many editors.
- The current publishing delay may be a problem for a significant number of editors working with timely content, such as banner alerts, news releases, or content related to a new policy.
- The option to schedule publishing would greatly improve some editor's workflow and help them accomplish their content goals.
- The CMS application's proofing page and preview features do not provide adequate system feedback in the interface.


## Method

*What method of research are you planning?*

**User interviews** with a walkthrough of the current publishing workflow. This will help us identify where the users' content goals intersect with the interface as they go through the publishing workflow (Start in edit form > save as published > review proofing page).  
- Moderated study conducted remotely via Zoom
- We will test the current interface with additional interview questions to understand the users's context and content goals.


## Participants and Recruitment
Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?

**User segments**
In progress, [identified in this mural](https://app.mural.co/t/vagov6717/m/vagov6717/1617047958544/3dbc389b51891b47d460ae01860a0df4c3316433)

**Primary criteria / Must have** 

- Represents a user segment identified above.
- Is a current CMS editor who has experience publishing live VA.gov content as part of their job.
- Can meet remotely

**Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

-

**What is your recruitment strategy?** 

Solicit help from VA product owners identified in the segmentation section.

When?

## Timeline: 

What dates do you plan to do research? 
TBD


**Prepare:** When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)
Demo environment available immediately or staging environment if not available. 

**Length of Sessions**
30 minutes

**Availability** If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.

TBD

**Pilot** 

*Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?*

TBD

## Team Roles
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker

**Moderator:**
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):
- Participant recruiting & screening:
- Project point of contact:
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Note-takers:
- Observers: List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work
