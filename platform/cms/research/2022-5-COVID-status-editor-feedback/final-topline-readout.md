# Research Goals

The primary goals of this research are to understand from the perspective of VHA Public Affairs Officers (PAOs):
* how the COVID-19 facility operating status content aligns with the on-the-ground policies and procedures at each facility
* what parts of the messaging are successful
* what parts of the messaging is confusing/conflicting or resulting in additional contact load for staff at the local facilities

# Research Questions

* What specific language is working or not working at the facility level? Why? 
* What other COVID messages do PAOs want to convey to Veterans, that are not covered by the national language? 
* How do PAOs decide on additional COVID messages about visitation they want to add to the website?  
* What feedback have Veterans given about the COVID messages on the website? 
* When editors need to convey info about their facilities, how do they choose among facility status, COVID status, system operating status, and banner alerts?  

# Methodology 

* Semi-structured interviews 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

The standardized COVID health protection guidelines do not reflect the actual policies and practices at local VAMC facilities. This creates multiple problems for Veterans and staff including: confusion for Veterans both before a visit and when they arrive, an increasing the burden on the the VA staff who may have to clarify the policies. This confusion and misalignment can slow the Veteran's ability to receive care.

# Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)_

1. The COVID-19 masking/distancing, screening and virtual care language generally works.

2. Because the national language is broader than local policies, there are discrepancies in communication with Veterans.

3. Because editors can’t customize the COVID language, they add additional details to a variety of other places on their websites.

**Finding 1: The COVID-19 masking/distancing, screening and virtual care language generally works.**

Labels: PRDT: Facilities, PRDT: VA Medical Centers (Websites), RESRCH: Interviews, RESRCH: Remote, SFTW: Website 

The masking/distancing, screening and virtual are language generally works for VAMCs. The broad nature of the visitor language however creates the potential for confusion, with the unintended consequence of a Veteran making a physical visit and being turned away.

“I think it’s fine the way it is. We try to keep it simple.” - P1

“I understand what you're trying to do. It's hard to make blanket statements even inside of our facility, let alone across the country that apply to every situation.” - P3

“I haven’t heard any positive or negative feedback about the wording.” - P5

“[the language] didn’t directly conflict [with our policies], but it didn’t completely align. It left ambiguity.” - P2_

**Finding 2: Because the national language is broader than local policies, there are discrepancies in communication with Veterans.**

Labels: PRDT: Facilities, PRDT: VA Medical Centers (Websites), RESRCH: Interviews, RESRCH: Remote, SFTW: Website 

From the VA design principles: The VA.gov customer experience should be consistent across tools, applications, and devices. A Veteran should be able to access the same content and user experience regardless of how they engage with their data.

“We want it to be consistent across all our channels that we’re putting this out on.” - P3

"[The national language] risked creating more confusion. It was a solution to a problem we didn’t have." - P2

"Veterans didn't understand [the new messages] either. They were like 'So how is this different?' Our response was 'It's not.'” - P3

**Finding 3: Because editors can’t customize the COVID language, they add additional details to a variety of other places on their websites.**

Labels: PRDT: Facilities, PRDT: VA Medical Centers (Websites), RESRCH: Interviews, RESRCH: Remote, SFTW: Website  

A scan of VAMC sites indicated that editors published COVID status-related content in banner alerts and in detail pages. As of August 3, 2022, there were 71 system banner alerts with situation updates related to COVID. The content may repeat the national language or include specific details pertinent to that facility as it relates to COVID measures.

“[It would be nice to have] the ability to pick and choose [language] that matches this level for your facility” - P4

“In the banner at the top, I put a message about ‘check the operating status for each location’ and I put the link there.” - P1 

“[Medical grade masks] is the part that we were trying to get on our banner.” - P2
"I guess I could add something on the home page" - P5

# Additional Insights

_Any additional insights that aren't "key findings." These can be powerful comments from users that don’t represent a pattern in this study, but may be part of one outside this study._


# Recommendations

* Remove the COVID facility status feature from the VAMC product
    * _Supporting evidence_
* Use the facility operating status for facility-specific restrictions
* Provide approved COVID-related messages that editors can customize
* Research and test solutions with editors before launching initiatives of this scale
* Do research with Veterans about the how the website prepares them for a visit (i.e. “How would you figure out whether you can bring your kid to your visit?”)
* Share research results with editors about how Veterans are using their sites
