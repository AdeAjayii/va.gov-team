# Research Goals

The primary goals of this research are to understand from the perspective of VHA Public Affairs Officers (PAOs):
* How the COVID-19 facility operating status content aligns with the on-the-ground policies and procedures at each facility.
* What parts of the messaging are successful.
* What parts of the messaging is confusing/conflicting or resulting in additional contact load for staff at the local facilities.

# Research Questions

* What specific language is working or not working at the facility level? Why? 
* What other COVID messages do PAOs want to convey to Veterans, that are not covered by the national language? 
* How do PAOs decide on additional COVID messages about visitation they want to add to the website?  
* What feedback have Veterans given about the COVID messages on the website? 
* When editors need to convey info about their facilities, how do they choose among facility status, COVID status, system operating status, and banner alerts?  

# Methodology 

* Semi-structured interviews 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

The standardized COVID health protection guidelines do not reflect the actual policies and practices at local VAMC facilities. This creates multiple problems for Veterans and staff including: confusion for Veterans both before a visit and when they arrive, an increasing the burden on the the VA staff who may have to clarify the policies. This confusion and misalignment can slow the Veteran's ability to receive care.

# Key Findings

1. The COVID-19 masking/distancing, screening and virtual care language generally works.

2. Because the national language is broader than local policies, there are discrepancies in communication with Veterans.

3. Because editors can’t customize the COVID language, they add additional details to a variety of other places on their websites.

**Finding 1: The COVID-19 masking/distancing, screening and virtual care language generally works.**

Labels: PRDT: Facilities, PRDT: VA Medical Centers (Websites), RESRCH: Interviews, RESRCH: Remote, SFTW: Website 

The masking/distancing, screening and virtual are language generally works for VAMCs. The broad nature of the visitor language however creates the potential for confusion, with the unintended consequence of a Veteran making a physical visit and being turned away.

“I think it’s fine the way it is. We try to keep it simple.” - P1

“I understand what you're trying to do. It's hard to make blanket statements even inside of our facility, let alone across the country that apply to every situation.” - P3

“I haven’t heard any positive or negative feedback about the wording.” - P5

“[the language] didn’t directly conflict [with our policies], but it didn’t completely align. It left ambiguity.” - P2_

**Finding 2: Because the national language is broader than local policies, there are discrepancies in communication with Veterans.**

Labels: PRDT: Facilities, PRDT: VA Medical Centers (Websites), RESRCH: Interviews, RESRCH: Remote, SFTW: Website 

From the VA design principles: The VA.gov customer experience should be consistent across tools, applications, and devices. A Veteran should be able to access the same content and user experience regardless of how they engage with their data.

“We want it to be consistent across all our channels that we’re putting this out on.” - P3

"[The national language] risked creating more confusion. It was a solution to a problem we didn’t have." - P2

"Veterans didn't understand [the new messages] either. They were like 'So how is this different?' Our response was 'It's not.'” - P3

**Finding 3: Because editors can’t customize the COVID language, they add additional details to a variety of other places on their websites.**

Labels: PRDT: Facilities, PRDT: VA Medical Centers (Websites), RESRCH: Interviews, RESRCH: Remote, SFTW: Website  

A scan of VAMC sites indicated that editors published COVID status-related content in banner alerts and in detail pages. As of August 3, 2022, there were 71 system banner alerts with situation updates related to COVID. The content may repeat the national language or include specific details pertinent to that facility as it relates to COVID measures.

“[It would be nice to have] the ability to pick and choose [language] that matches this level for your facility” - P4

“In the banner at the top, I put a message about ‘check the operating status for each location’ and I put the link there.” - P1 

“[Medical grade masks] is the part that we were trying to get on our banner.” - P2
"I guess I could add something on the home page" - P5

# Additional Insights

## What specific language is working or not working at the facility level?
Masking
* 5 of the 6 said the language works
* 1 said that a medical-grade mask is required at their facilities
* 1 observed that community acceptance of masks differs from their facility’s protocol

Screening
* 6 of the 6 said the language does apply 
* “May” is the operative word
* 2 facilities allows self-screening at level High
* No concerns about significant confusion for Veterans

Visitors
* Only 2 of the 6 said the language works
* 1 person is unsure
* 3 people pointed out the way the language creates conflict

Virtual Care
* 4 of the 6 said language works
* 1 person is unsure 
* 1 person pointed out a possible conflict

## What other COVID messages do PAOs want to convey to Veterans, that are not covered by the national language?
Masking = medical-grade mask required

Screening = exact screening location, self-screening options, screening is or is not required (vs. “may be required”)

Visitors = age restrictions, types of visitors allowed, policies for particular departments or floors

Virtual care = clarity that this is in addition to physical visits

## Research Questions - Answered
**How do PAOs decide on additional COVID messages about visitation they want to add to the website?**
Participants take direction on COVID messages from medical director, public affairs, and other facility leadership.
**What feedback have Veterans given about the COVID messages on the website?**
Some reports of questions about discrepancies in old/new policies. One PAO fielded questions via social media. Most participants do not have direct contact with Veterans.  
**When editors need to convey info about their facilities, how do they choose among facility status, COVID status, system operating status, and banner alerts?**
Approaches vary. Participants choose based on their own perception of what is the most visible. More research is needed.

# Recommendations

* Remove the COVID facility status feature from the VAMC product.
    * Editors described a clear gap between the national language and the operational realities at their facilities.
* Use the facility operating status for facility-specific restrictions.
* Provide approved COVID-related messages that editors can customize.
* Research and test solutions with editors before launching initiatives of this scale.
    * There were no interviews with editors prior to launching the initiative.  
* Do research with Veterans about the how the website prepares them for a visit (i.e. “How would you figure out whether you can bring your kid to your visit?”)
* Share research results with editors about how Veterans are using their sites.

# Next Steps

* New language for COVID facility status will be developed and approved centrally.
* The CMS user interface will be updated to reflect the new guidance and messaging.

## Tools used for Synthesis

## Secondary research

The research team used the [Drupal CMS Facility status tool](https://prod.cms.va.gov/admin/content/facilities/facility-status) to identify how VAMC facilities were using the COVID facility status and alerts to communicate their status to Veterans. Tool requires CMS access.
