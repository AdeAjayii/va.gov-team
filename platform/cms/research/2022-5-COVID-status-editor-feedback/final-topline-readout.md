# Research Goals

The primary goals of this research are to understand from the perspective of VHA Public Affairs Officers (PAOs):
* how the COVID-19 facility operating status content aligns with the on-the-ground policies and procedures at each facility
* what parts of the messaging are successful
* what parts of the messaging is confusing/conflicting or resulting in additional contact load for staff at the local facilities

# Research Questions

* What specific language is working or not working at the facility level? Why? 
* What other COVID messages do PAOs want to convey to Veterans, that are not covered by the national language? 
* How do PAOs decide on additional COVID messages about visitation they want to add to the website?  
* What feedback have Veterans given about the COVID messages on the website? 
* When editors need to convey info about their facilities, how do they choose among facility status, COVID status, system operating status, and banner alerts?  

# Methodology 

* Semi-structured interviews 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

The standardized COVID health protection guidelines do not reflect the actual policies and practices at local VAMC facilities. This creates multiple problems for Veterans and staff including: confusion for Veterans both before a visit and when they arrive, an increasing the burden on the the VA staff who may have to clarify the policies. This confusion and misalignment can slow the Veteran's ability to receive care.

# Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)_

1. The COVID-19 masking/distancing, screening and virtual care language generally works.

2. Because the national language is broader than local policies, there are discrepancies in communication with Veterans.

3. Because editors can’t customize the COVID language, they add additional details to a variety of other places on their websites.

# Details of Findings 

_For each finding, list details with supporting quotes and images when possible. Please **add relevant keywords/labels to your findings** selected from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc). Adding keywords/labels to your findings will help others find research relevant to their work._
