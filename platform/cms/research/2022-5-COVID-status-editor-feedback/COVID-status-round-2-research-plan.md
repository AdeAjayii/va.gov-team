# Research Plan for COVID Facility Operating Status – June 2022

## Background

VHA introduced 3 levels of standard COVID-19 health protection guidelines in May 2022. VAMC editors in Drupal CMS must select the current level for their locations so that Veterans can see the level for those locations on VA.gov.

The language describing a facility’s COVID operating status is managed centrally by the Office of Health Transformation (OHT). It was designed to be general enough to encompass a variety of use cases at the facility level. However, some facilities have found that their local policies don’t fit into the national language. Visitor policies are a particular source of discrepancy. 

Some Drupal CMS editors have worked around this by adding further details related to COVID-19 health protection guidelines to other parts of their website. For example, as of June 22, 2022, 97 facilities have supplemental COVID-related information published in their website banner alerts.

OHT is interested in allowing site editors to customize information about COVID guidelines. But first we need to understand what information editors want to convey to Veterans, and what is and isn’t working about the current COVID status language. 
 
## OCTO objectives
### North Star
* Increase the quality and reliability of VA services 

### Goal
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information 

### Numbers
* Increasing 
  * Usage of digital, self- service tools 
  * Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov 
* Decreasing 
  * Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution 

### Veteran journey
Veterans entering the fourth stage of their VA journey (Starting up) start to seek out VA services to attend to their healthcare needs. This can be the start of an ongoing set of interactions with their VAMC facility that likely will require onsite visits. 

The COVID status of their chosen facility is vital to helping Veterans understand what to expect so they can plan their next visit. For those relying on the web channel for information, VA.gov plays an instrumental role in describing a facility’s COVID status and related visitation rules.

## Research goals
The primary goals of this research is to determine how the COVID-19 facility operating status content is working or is not working, and why, from a Public Affairs Officer (PAO) perspective.

## Outcomes
The results of this research will be used to develop recommendations for OCTO-DE and OHT to inform a potential iteration of the COVID facility operating status in Drupal.

## Hypothesis
PAOs want the flexibility to add specific, local guidance to the national COVID operating status language, in order to provide Veterans with the info they need for their visit.

## Research Questions
* What specific language is working or not working at the facility level? Why? 
* What other COVID messages do PAOs want to convey to Veterans, that are not covered by the national language? 
* How do PAOs decide on additional COVID messages about visitation they want to add to the website?  
* What feedback have Veterans given about the COVID messages on the website? 
* When editors need to convey info about their facilities, how do they choose among facility status, COVID status, system operating status, and banner alerts?  
  
## Method
* Semi-structured interviews 
  
## Location
* Remote, via Zoom 
  
## Research materials
* A conversation guide will be developed prior to the interviews. 

## Recruitment
The CMS Facilities team will work with VHA Digital Media to recruit 6-7 PAOs for this research using the the following criteria:
* Are at the facility, not VISN level 
* Represent an equal mix of urban and rural areas 
* Represent large and small geographic territories 
* Have not been involved in previous research with the CMS Facilities team 
  
## Timeline

  * CMS Facilities research team to share research plan with OCTO-DE and OHT for input 
  * VHA DM to identify 12 potential participants for interviews 
* June 29: CMS Facilities research team to start scheduling participants for interviews while starting conversation guide draft 
* June 30- July 8: Interviews with PAO participants 
* July 11-15: Synthesis of research findings, including data from help desk, and development of readout deck and recommendations for discussion with OCTO-DE Product Owner Dave Conlon
