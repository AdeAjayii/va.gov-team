## Research goals
- Understand whether the help text and labels in the editorial experience contribute to editor’s understanding of the task.
- Understand potential confusion points about the operating status

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about a new way of managing information about COVID protocols for your VAMC’s facilities using the Drupal VA.gov content management system.
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

This entire session should take about 45 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions, so anything you share today will be anonymous. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to make it easier for site editors to update their content. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. 

You'll be interacting with a prototype, not the real CMS. You may encounter some things that don’t work. That’s ok! We’ll let you know when that’s the case. 
We can stop the session at any time. If you want to stop, just let me know. 

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete the analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, I'd like to learn a little more about you and your work.

What’s your role at the VA?


How long have you been in this role?


What are your responsibilities for the website?


In general, how confident do you feel about working in Drupal CMS? Not confident, confident, or very confident?

 
How often do you update content on your website?


How long does that usually take you?

What kind of tasks do you most often do on the site? 

Have you ever updated the operating status for a facility in your system?


## Task background

Great, thank you for telling me a bit about yourself.   I’ll start by sharing some background on the task we’re about to do. Soon VA will implement a standardized system for communicating COVID-19 protocols for your VAMC system facilities. 
Have you heard anything about this change yet?

Here’s some more about it:
In addition to a facility operating status, each facility will have a COVID-19 status that you’ll update in the CMS.
 There will be 3 levels of standard COVID-19 health protection guidelines. [Once the change launches,] You will need to select the initial level for your facility(ies) immediately. 
The new facility COVID-19 level status will help Veterans understand what to expect so they can plan their visit and increase consistency in how facility information is presented.
 
Your facility's COVID-19 level must  be [will be]  updated according to the schedule set by your VAMC system's leadership. You will see a new field in the VAMC Facility content type where you will make this selection.

Shortly I’ll introduce what that task will be like, but before we do that, I’m curious what you think of this information. 

Do you have any questions about what I’ve said so far?

Given this upcoming change and your experience working with the CMS so far, what do you think is most important to communicate to other editors before this launches?

Do you have any suggestions to help editors understand what’s being asked of them?

When it comes time to do this for your facilities, we expect that making the updates in the CMS is expected to take 5-15 minutes. Next I’ll walk you through the steps for doing that so we can get your feedback on what that’s like for you. 


## Task 1
Now we’re going to do a short task walkthrough. I'll give you a link to a prototype, and ask you to talk through how you would go about completing it. We’ll ask you to think out loud, and I may interrupt you to ask about what you’re thinking. Again, we’re testing the design, not you, so please feel free to be honest when you don’t understand something or are having difficulty.

I’m about to drop a link into the Zoom chat to the prototype we’ll use. Can you open it?

Great. Now can you share your screen so we can follow along together?

Here we are at the VAMC facility content type. 

Can you look for the place where you’d go to manage this new information?


Great. And can you read this area aloud and tell me what this means to you?


How confident would you feel choosing a COVID-19 level based on what you see here? Say your facility’s leadership has already given you some information.


What else might you need to know to feel confident?


What would you do next?


Now that you’ve selected a level, can you tell me what you expect to happen on your site as a result?


Do you have any questions or uncertainties about what you just did?


Task 2: Operating status


Say you want to review your facility’s operating status to make sure it’s correct. Can you go to the place where you’d do that?

Can you read aloud what you see here and tell us what you think

Let’s pretend you just updated your COVID-19 level to high. What, if anything, would you want to consider here for the operating status.


[If they haven’t already saved, prompt them to do that]. Ask them where they’d go to verify information. 

Other questions

Thank you for your feedback. Do you have any questions for us? 


If they are questions about the status overall and the business process, we can direct them to the COVID-19 Communications Teams channel.
