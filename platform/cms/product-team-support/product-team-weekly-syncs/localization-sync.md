# CMS and Localization team sync on 1/27/22

## Attendees:
* CMS team: Clarence Maeng, Kev Walsh, Jess Kubl, Dave Conlon
* Localization team: Sharon Kasimow, Adam Whitlock, Danielle Thierry, Michelle Steigerwalt

## Agenda:
* CMS team looking for clarity on upcoming milestones and timelines for the localization effort
* Localization team looking for status of Content API, as that's viewed as a blocker/dependency

## Notes:
* Path in the mean time, while content api work is underway, is to do what we've been doing - manual translation by the Sitewide Content team per page/node
* Content API status and timeframe: public API launched into production early Q3
  * Will be refining that in the next week
* Any opportunity for Localization to work with CAPI on the effort
  * Platform CMS will be looking for new use cases soon
  * Does that include the pilot? Yes
* Any translation needs between now and then will be done with current workflow
* Can we talk if any work might be done in parallel?
  * What we're trying to achieve to see if there's a way to take the content on the site and get ahead to begin translating beforehand
* Does localization need to wait for the API or can they do it in parallel?
  * Dave wants to think through that from a strategic standpoint
  * Priority = going after the vital content (eligibility, benefits) concentrating on Spanish first
  * Goal is to take a slow and sustainable approach to ensure quality
  * Technical wrinkle that needs to be determined a bit:
    * Turning it on ahead of time
    * Translation affects all GraphQL queries
    * May not be possible without some advanced work
* More investigation needed to explore
