## Week of Jan 11

- Facility status live training (to include Dave, Stan, Lisa, Michelle, CMS to reach out to PW to see if others need to join)
  - Michelle met with Dave yesterday to confirm content
  - Verify the list of attendees. Michelle: confirmed, it's just the Vet Center folks from the email Michelle sent. 
  - VBA training possibly later. 
  - Date: Dave has a preference for the week of inauguration. Week of 25th, for roughly one hour in the afternoon to meet all time zones. Dave is handling schedules. 
    - Michelle will gets some options, and David Addison will schedule.
- Process for managing this doc (Kevin)
  - Anyone can update 
  - Kevin will post in vsa-facilities on Thursdays with draft agenda
- GraphQL query limit monitoring
  - A limit unbeknownst to CMS team that the query only returns 2000 nodes with stand-alone URLs. Never a problem until Erie, and some pages were missing. Investigation found the limit. Michael bumped that limit to 5000 nodes. Neil's research from 6 months ago didn't acknowledge that 2000 nodes limit, so we don't know where the limit is. Core CMS team is now testing where the actual limit is. CMS ops team can bump that limit locally for tests.
  - We'll provide updates to Michelle and Dave when we have them. 
  - We'll know when we hit this limit because FE will stop building. 
  - CMS Core team issue for test: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/3961
