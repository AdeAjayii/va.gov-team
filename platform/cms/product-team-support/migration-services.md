The CMS team can provide migration consulting and services to other product teams. 

As part of [CMS product discovery](../cms-product-discovery.md), we will identify the need for this service as well as a general time and strategy for its delivery. 


1. Orientation to migration process for product teams.
   * Review the overall process and how it maps to the product timeline established through [CMS Product Discovery](../cms-product-discovery.md)
2. Orientation for engineers to migration in VA CMS - meeting with migration developers 
   * Our custom modules
   * Drupal.org documentation 
   * Approach to testing
   * Code review process 
3. Review of destination content model
   * Plan changes that are necessary. (see [content model service](../cms-content-modelling.md))
4. Source data analysis
   * Analysis of CSVs, API sources, etc. A sample of data is sufficient for this analysis.
     * Data integrity (spilling out of container, multiple lines), columns maintain their lines
     * Suitable for migration
     * Do things map to other drupal entities (entity references, migration lookups)
     * Data map to specific fields.
5. Code review for source data
6. Code review for migration
