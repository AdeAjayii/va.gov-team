# CMS content style guide for VA.gov CMS
This is our house style guide for the VA.gov CMS website. It’s shared across VA administrations and teams, so we can speak with one voice and create a consistent, helpful experience for CMS editors. This style guide is a living document and will change over time, based on user research and feedback.

## When to use this guide
This guide is to help people make good UX writing decisions when designing parts of the CMS interface, and to help promote consistency across the application. 

You might be writing a button label, some help text, or even a Knowledge Base article. Anything one of our users reads while using the CMS counts as UX writing, and should follow the style outlined in this guide. 

There’s a lot this guide won’t cover, especially when it comes to more general determinations about style. When in doubt, follow [VA.gov content style](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/), and if it’s not covered there, follow AP style.
