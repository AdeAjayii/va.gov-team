# Requesting documentation support from the Content and IA team (for other VSP teams)

The VSP documentation team is available to help other VSP teams with their documentation efforts. This document explains how to request documentation support and guidelines for writing your own documentation.

**Key points:**

*   For any documentation support request, [create a documentation support issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=gmaciolek&labels=content-ia-team%2C+documentation-support&template=documentation-support-request.md) or add documentation team members as reviewers on a PR.
*   Documentation support requests are triaged 2 times per week using the [VSP documentation project board](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/projects/16). Ticket triage decisions are based on priority within the Content and IA team roadmap, scope, and resource availability.
*   You are free to write and manage your own documentation initiatives, large or small, at any time. However, for [large](#large-project) projects, [we have some guidelines](#diy-guidelines).
*   Vague documentation requests are encouraged. If VFS teams are confused about something related to your work and you think documentation would help, enlist our help early. We can do some analysis and research and give you suggestions to move forward.
*   If you think your documentation problem would benefit from reasearch, we suggest starting with a documentation review first. Often, improvements that can be made by applying documentation writing best practices. Research can be done to inform iterative improvements after that.


## Documentation requests

## DIY Documentation Guidelines

We want to foster a culture of documentation and encourage teams to incorporate ongoing documentation updates and improvements into your workflow. For large projects, we do have a lightweight, flexible process to make sure we are aware of what you’re working on and have a chance to give some feedback along the way.

Based on research and customer feedback, we may make or propose edits to your documents. For anything more than minor tweaks, we will be sure to inform teams affected by the changes ahead of time and include the appropriate people in the review process.


### Large projects

If you have a big documentation initiative on your roadmap and don’t want to be held up by waiting for the documentation team’s priorities to align with yours, you can proceed without us, but we ask that you check in with us according to the following process.

*Note: Before taking on a large documentation initiative, we recommend that you submit a documentation support request so we can review your problem space and give you guidance on how to proceed.* 


#### Kickoff meeting

The product manager of the requesting team should contact the Content and IA team to give a heads up before starting work. We will schedule a kickoff meeting with the appropriate members of the requesting team to discuss timing, scope, goals, context, audience and other relevant high-level topics.


#### Asynchronous in-progress check-ins

These checkins are intended as a flexible framework to give some support and feedback throughout the project. The specifics of when and how we check in can be adjusted, depending on project details. 

*   **30% check-in:**
    *   Turnaround time: 3-5 days
    *   When you think you are about 30% done with the project, share your progress with the documentation team in #vsp-content-ia. 
    *   We’ll provide high-level feedback on your plan and the overall structure of your doc(s).
*   **90% check-in:**
    *   Turnaround time: 3-5 days
    *   When you think you’re 90% done writing, share your docs with the documentation team in #vsp-content-ia.
    *   We’ll provide detailed editorial feedback.
*   **Optional additional check-ins:** \
If you want to check in more frequently than 2 asynchronous reviews or meet to discuss feedback, let us know and we can work something out based on our availability.


#### Release plan/project closeout check-in

When you’re wrapping up your work, depending on what deliverables were defined in the documentation project plan, we’ll have one final check-in to review your release plan and communication plan (if applicable) and discuss next steps. This check-in can be asynchronous or a meeting, whatever makes the most sense for the project.


#### Optional retro meeting

Since this is a new process, we’d love your feedback to help us iterate and improve. As the project is wrapping up, we’ll schedule a meeting to review how things went and answer any questions.


### Small to medium projects

Write, edit, update and organize most of your own documentation, as needed, without involving the documentation team directly. See our resources and guides to help you as you plan, write, and publish.
