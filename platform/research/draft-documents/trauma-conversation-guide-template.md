# Trauma-Informed Conversation Guide 

## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*
*Mute your Slack notifications*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*Let observer(s) know that they'll be in the waiting room until/if the participant agrees to have them in the session.*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.*

*In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked*

*Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.*

*Admit the notetaker and the participant*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME]. 

I'm joined by my social work colleague, [Name, who appears on camera with what they want to be called by the participant, not "Observer"]. If you need support at any time during this call, please feel free to ask me to stop and for [Name] to help answer questions or provide support. I may ask [Name] to help provide support if needed.

I have a teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. 

*(For sessions with a participant using a screen reader:)* [Usability Specialist NAME] is also in this meeting to help with any technical issues that may arise with your use of a screen reader during this session.


I would like to get your preference on how many people are on this call. We can conduct a private session between the folks on this call right now, or we can invite [insert explicit number] of my teammates to join us. They find it helpful to be able to watch these sessions to learn more about how Veterans use VA.gov, but we can also just share our notes with them after this session ends. Both are perfectly OK. What matters most to us is what’s most comfortable for you. 

Would you prefer a private session between us, or are you comfortable with another team member joining the call?
*If OK with someone else joining:* 
- Admit observer(s)

*If not:*
- Is there anything we can do to make you feel more comfortable?

*(If not comfortable, slack observer(s) in #feedback-backchannel to let them know that they won't be able to join.)*

*If yes:*

Thank you! I will now invite them in. *(Let observer into the meeting with their camera off and name set to "Observer").* 

Before we continue, I'd like to tell you a little more about who I am and what we’re doing...

I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure our resources meet their needs.

For this feedback session, we're here because VA is [DOING...]. As part of these efforts, our team is exploring how to make it easier for Veterans to [TASK]. Your input could help us make the resources easier to use by Veterans like you. You'll try them out while thinking about a hypothetical [TOPIC] situation, not your own experiences.

Are you comfortable trying out resources for [TOPIC] and sharing your opinions about them?

*If no:*

Is there anything we can do to make you feel more comfortable?
*[Get verbal confirmation or end session]*

*If yes:*

We've asked you to participate because you’re a Veteran, not because we believe that you have [TOPIC]. If you’ve experienced any type of [TOPIC] in the past, conversations in this session might remind you of these past experiences. We won’t share what you tell us with anyone.

Are you comfortable proceeding with this session?

*If no:*

Is there anything we can do to make you feel more comfortable?
*[Get verbal confirmation or end session]*

*If yes:* Thank you! We very much appreciate you talking with us today. 

Today we're going to talk about [description of your project]. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing you. We're testing these resources to learn how we can make them better for all Veterans. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. If at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, let me know and we'll move on to the next question.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You can take a break from the session or end it altogether. You will not lose your stipend or be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

- I'd like to record my screen and audio as we talk today to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. We respect your need for confidentiality--we won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to your name or any information that could identify you. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Protocol for Recognizing & Handling Trauma-Triggering

### OBSERVE the participant
*Be PRESENT with the participant. Notice their body language, tone of voice, and the environment* 

*SENSE discomfort, anxiety, nervousness, anger, teary/crying, shakiness. Some signs may include:*
- *Prolonged silences*
- *Shifts in tone or attitude or interactivity*
- *New background noises*
- *Staring into space* 

### If notice a change, SAY one of these:
  - Sometimes talking about these types of experiences can be difficult. Do you think you would be comfortable telling me if it starts to affect you negatively?
  - I realize this is hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?
  - I sense that this may be upsetting. We value what you’re sharing with us, but we don’t have to go there.
  - Would you like me to stop recording?
  - Do you want to just sit here quietly for a few minutes?
  - Would you like to pause, or are you OK with continuing?
  - Is this not a good time for this session?

### Social worker/clinician on the session (or on standby) jumps in to provide support, if notice triggering 
- As a reminder, *[Name]* is a professional here to support you.
- I want to remind you that VA can help connect you to mental health services--even if you're not enrolled in VA health care. To access services right away, call or go to any VA medical center at any time 24/7 or any Vet Center during clinic hours. You can also call 877-222-8387, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. That's 877-222-8387.
- If you find that you're in crisis and need to talk to someone right away, you can also call our Veterans Crisis Line.

### If I feel teary or emotional
*Turn off my camera and/or say,* I need to step away for a moment.

### If no clinician observer and you notice something
I want to remind you that VA can help connect you to mental health services--even if you're not enrolled in VA health care. To access services right away, call or go to any VA medical center at any time 24/7 or any Vet Center during clinic hours. You can also call 877-222-8387, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET. That's 877-222-8387.

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - X minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

## First Task: [TASK NAME] - X minutes

*If the task might be triggering to the participant, present a made-up hypothetical situation and NOT ask participants about their own experiences until the end of the session.*

- Step 1
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Is the participant aware that they may be sharing personal information on their screen, and are they okay with that? - per question as needed]
- [Etc]

## Second Task: [TASK NAME] - X minutes

- Step 1
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]

- [Etc]

## Third Task: [TASK NAME] - X minutes

- Step 1
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Question 1
- Question 2

*(If you want to ask the participant about their own experiences with the potentially traumatic topic, do it here near the end of the session and say that it's optional like this...)*

- We would like the TOPIC resources to meet the needs of ALL Veterans who may have been TOPIC at a VA site. If you've ever experienced any type of TOPIC at VA, and are willing to share, we would like to know a little more about your experiences. I'm not asking for details, and I don't want you to re-live these difficult experiences. Your feedback today has been valuable, even if you decide to not answer the questions I'm about to ask. If you share anything about your experiences or someone else's with me, what you say will remain confidential. Are you comfortable if I ask a few more questions?

Have you or anyone you know ever [TRAUMATIC TOPIC]?

*(If they share a painful experience, say...)*
- I am sorry you (or your friend) had this experience. We appreciate you sharing this with us. Your story will inform how we provide resources to help Veterans in the future. 

- Any questions for me? 


## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again!

*(if this session didn't appear to trigger a traumatic response)* And I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!
