# Responding to emergencies during remote research sessions

As researchers, our number one priority is to keep our participants safe. When working with Veterans, it is particularly important to be aware of our participants psychological and physical well-being during our research sessions. If you find yourself in a session with a Veteran who is experiencing a medical or phsychological emergency, follow the protocol below to request assistance. 

### Requesting emergency assistance
1. Stop your research activity in order to attend to the participant. 
2. Contact Perigean over Slack immediately. Please use the direct message set up by Lauren at the start of the study so that everyone is notified. 
3. Include a description of the scenario so that Perigean can respond appropriately (for example: the participant stopped responding and became listless during the interview; the participant vocalized intent to harm themselves/others) 
4. When Perigean arrives in the meeting (if they are not already attending as a notetaker), be available to answer questions so they can reach out to 911 or the Veteran Crisis Hotline as appropriate. 
5. After the emergency has been handled, please update the Slack channel. 

Witnessing an emergency can be a traumatizing experience. Be sure to take time to pause and check in with yourself, and let your team know if you need any support.

### Creating a safe space for participants
Although we may not intend it, research sessions inherently create a power dynamic where the moderator is in control: participants don't know what questions they will be asked, what tasks they will be given, and the moderator represents the VA. Before you start your research study, consider ways that you can create a psychologically safe space for participants that shifts the power dynamic in favor of the participant. 

**Get an accessibility review.** Our VSP Accessibility team (@vetsgov-accessibility on Slack) can provide expert advice on effective and ethical research design for participants with various disabilities, and ensure your research methods are appropriate for our Veteran population. 

**Give participants an exit strategy.** In your conversation guide, be sure to tell participants that they can pause or stop the session at any time, no questions asked. 

**Be mindful of participant's behavior.** If they appear to be distressed, take a moment to check in with them. 

**Prioritize the participant over the research.** Be prepared to pivot from your conversation guide and approach in order to meet your participant where they are.
