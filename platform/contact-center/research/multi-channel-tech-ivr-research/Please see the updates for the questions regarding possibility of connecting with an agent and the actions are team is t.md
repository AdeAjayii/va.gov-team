Please see the updates for the questions regarding possibility of connecting with an agent and the actions are team is taking to mitigate this risk. 

 

1. Will you only be calling phone numbers with automated IVRs? (i.e. no humans?) Yes, the scope of our research is only the automated portion. Our scope ends when a caller is in queue for an agent or prior to that.  Is there any chance in which a participant would wind up on the phone with a contact center representative as part of this study? There is a VERY small chance, which is a risk our leadership is aware of. Each contact center will also only have 5-10 calls total to their IVR. Aside from the low volume, the HCD team has developed steps to mitigate this possibility during their usability studies. They have become familiar with each of the 8 pre-selected IVR call flows (i.e.: routes, menu options, scripts, etc.) so they know at what point each IVR transitions to a call center agent. The scenarios they develop will ensure a caller hangs up once they hear a certain script or music prior to possibility of connecting with an agent. This is written into the Conversation Guide. In the event an agent does pick up during an interview, we will have a pre-approved script for the HCD team to say to the agent.

 

1. If so, we would need to notify that contact center about the study, & obtain their permission before we could do so. We also need to be VERY mindful of taking up a contact center rep’s time. Our intention is to only study the IVRs and not make any contact with an agent. The team is taking actions to mitigate this possibility. With each contact center having 5-10 total calls to their IVR, this would be a minimal impact. Because of the minimal risk with low volume and added precautionary actions to mitigate the risk of connecting with an agent, we do not foresee reaching out to the contact centers about the IVR study.

 

If you’d like a more in-depth review of the mitigating steps the team is taking to minimize the risk of connecting with agent, we’d be happy to schedule a call to review these with you.

 

Thank you, 

Kate



Hi Kate, 

 

I took a look at the research plan with our recruiters & COR, and we had some questions / concerns about the study design. It sounds like you have done this kind of study before, and I’m curious how well it has worked and what pain points you experienced in past. This is the first time we have led a study like this. That being said, the team has conducted considerable research and planning into the best format(s) to acquire IVR experience data, which have been presented and refined over several months with VEO leadership as well as telephony and contact center SMEs across the VA.

The scenarios they develop will ensure a caller hangs up once they hear a certain script or music, depending on the IVR, which will be written into the Conversation Guide. In the event an agent does pick up during an interview, we will have a pre-approved script for the HCD team to say to the agent.
2. If so, we would need to notify that contact center about the study, & obtain their permission before we could do so. We also need to be VERY mindful of taking up a contact center rep’s time. Yes, we will be notifying the contact centers so they’re aware 4-5 interviews will be conducted on their IVR. We plan to send these emails out in the next week. We will ensure they’re onboard with our research approach, and we’ll also offer to  invite a member from their team to join the interview as an observer, if they’d like.
3. Do you know if the contact centers you are calling track analytics? I.e. will you be affecting their analytics by calling and having the participant hang up? This is something our leadership has discussed, and because only 4-5 interviews will be conducted per IVR, there is minimal risk to skewing the metrics.
4. We would not be able to allow recording for this study, especially if you are calling industry contact centers/IVRs. Recording another company’s IVR is not kosher. That is fine with us. We understand.
5. The Zoom will not allow you to call in other numbers, and no, we do not use Teams for any of our studies. If you have experience doing this type of study with WebEx, we do offer that account type as an alternative. Thank you! We will plan to use your Zoom account and allow the Veteran to use their phone (with speaker phone enabled) for making the call and interacting with the IVR.
6. Have you done this kind of study remotely? No, this is the first time we’ll be studying IVRs through Veteran interviews. It sounds like it would work well in person, but remote seems much harder. Logistically you would need to identify participants who can both be on a computer and on their phone at the same time. So, you’re going to be doing a LOT of remote hand-holding to get people to dial the number, hold their phones close enough that you can hear, get them to hang up on time, and then ask questions, repeated several times. Yes, we agree there is nothing standard about this study! The HCD team has been internally testing the use of speakerphone through WebEx and Zoom, and we are comfortable with the level of clarity for others listening to the IVR through WebEx/Zoom.

 

One consideration: I fully recognize that a simulated study is certainly not the same as interacting with the IVR itself, for the purposes of trying to call several IVRs to validate their effectiveness, and identify possible confusing triggers, I recommend that you & your team consider it. You could pre-listen to the IVRs you want to test, have your participant “pretend” to call, and ask a researcher (or another of your teammates) to read the scripts out loud, then ask your follow up questions. Thank you for the suggestion, and this is something we have discussed as a team and are looking into!

 

Additionally – you will need to pull together a conversation guide / script that is separate from the research plan. I see some of the questions in the RP, but I need a full script to identify that you have an appropriate introduction and conclusion in addition to your full list of questions. I need that document before I can kick this off. Sounds great! We will plan to have the Conversation Guide to you by the end of the week.

 

Let me know if you have any questions.
