### Contact Center Training Video Process

Contact center training videos are the video version of the product guide and are created by the product team.  This can easily be done by recording a Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, 
or Skype call.  During the video the team shouold walk though the primary flows of the product, using layman terms whenever possible. 
One or both of the Contact Center POCs should also be on the call to see the product in use and to ask any potential follow up questions.
If neither are available, the video can still be created by the team and sent to the # vsp-contact-center-support Slack channel for review.
