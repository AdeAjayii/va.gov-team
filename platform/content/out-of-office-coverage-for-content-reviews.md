# Out of office coverage plan for Platform content reviews


1. VSP Platform content editor (Peggy) to provide all product teams with as much notice as possible for planned PTO time (at least 1 week). 

2. VSP Platform content editor will work though content reviews (depending on priority and complexity) ahead of planned PTO time. The goal is to complete all in-flight content review requests before going out of office. 

3. If a submitted content review requires an additional review that would fall during PTO time, Peggy will work with VSP Content & I/A PM to designate a backup reviewer. 

4. If a product team submits a content review during Peggy’s PTO time, VSP Content & I/A PM will work with the requesting team to determine the timeline of the review. For reviews that can’t wait until Peggy returns, PM will designate another Content & I/A team member to do the review. 


## Process for requesting a content review during Platform content editor PTO

1. Product team assigns content review ticket to Megan Kelley (VSP Content & I/A PM) and Kristina Gore. 

2. Megan and Kristina will work with the requesting team to determine timeline of the review, and if this review needs to be completed before Peggy returns. 

3. Megan will remain “assigned” to the issue until the content review is completed and the issue is closed. This is to ensure that a Platform member can assist if follow up is needed. This will also allow Megan and Kristina to debrief Peggy appropriately when she returns to the office.
