## The Problem

Since the release of the modernized VA.gov in 2018, there has been no dedicated focus to optimize VA.gov's search experience -- both off-site (organic) and on-site - to the benefit of our users.  And yet, search is a primary utility/tool for VA.gov's users-- e.g., more than 40% of daily site visitors are referred by search engines and more than 10% of daily visitors use site search.  

Clearly, providing an authoritative, reliable and modern off-site and on-site experience for Veterans fully aligns with our North Star goals of:

- Increase the use of self-service tools, focusing on services most important to Veterans.
- Decrease the time users spend waiting for an outcome.
- Consistently deliver a satisfying, reliable, and secure online experience.
- Be the single source of truth of Veterans-related health and benefits content for service-members and VA stakeholders.
