## The Problem

Providing a first-class, modern on-site search tool for Veterans fully aligns with our North Star goals of:

Increase the use of self-service tools, focusing on services most important to Veterans.
Decrease the time users spend waiting for an outcome.
Consistently deliver a satisfying, reliable, and secure online experience.

### User Goals

As a user, I want to:

- Easily and quickly find the information I need with few clicks as possible on the VA.gov Website.
- Avoid reading long pages of content in order to get to my desired outcome.
- Get the most relevant results when I use VA.gov search.
- Get the most relevant results even if I am not precise about the information I seek or make a mistake in my search terms.
