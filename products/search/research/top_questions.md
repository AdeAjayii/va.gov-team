# VA.gov Search 2.0 Analytics Review

## Project Overview
To better understand the effectiveness of (WBC) VA.gov's on-site and off-site search as a primary discovery tool, we conducted an analytics review to learn more about the following:

For the analysis, the following tools were used:

- For on-site search:
  - Search.gov Analysits
  - Google Analytics
  
- For off-site search:
  - Google Search Console
  - Bing Web Developer Tools
