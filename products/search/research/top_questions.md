# VA.gov Search 2.0 Analytics Review

## Project Overview
To better understand the effectiveness of (WBC) VA.gov's on-site and off-site search as a primary discovery tool, we conducted an analytics review to learn more about the following:

- user behavior
- off-site search positioning and performance (including site optimization, keyword authority, etc.)
- on-site search quality (including search results relevance, etc.) 

For the analysis, the following tools were used:

- For on-site search:
  - Search.gov Analytics
  - Google Analytics
  
- For off-site search:
  - Google Search Console
  - Bing Web Developer Tools
  - SEMRush

## On-Site Search
### Top Questions/Answers

***1. How important is on-site search as a discoverability tool for VA.gov users?***
- Since the launch of the modernized VA.gov in November 2018, the average number of searches conducted monthly has grown to more than 550,000
  - the average number of searches conducted daily over the past year is about 25,000, with a sharp decline on the weekends.
  - (Question: Has search activity grown or stalled over the past year?)
- 10.5% of site visitors used site search (Date Range: June 2019-2020 Source: Google Analytics)
- Search is tied for #6 among VA.gov site tasks (Source: Google Analytics [Top Tasks report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy+planning/analytics/top-task-analytics.md))
- Notably, search does not appear to be one of the [top interactions on the Home Page](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#/report/content-event-events/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20190412&_u.date01=20200412&_.goalOption=ALL&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50&explorer-table.advFilter=%5B%5B0,%22analytics.eventAction%22,%22RE%22,%22Scroll%20Depth%7CScript%20error.%22,1%5D,%5B0,%22analytics.pagePath%22,%22EQ%22,%22~2Findex.html%22,0%5D%5D&explorer-table.secSegmentId=analytics.pagePath&explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId=analytics.eventAction/)

***2. What are users searching for on VA.gov?***

Users are searching for general health and benefit information, forms, and some specific tasks. (Source: Google Analytics [Logged-in homepage discovery: Analytics review April 2019-April 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md).) 

- "Benefits" (~150K) and "health" (~59K) are the most searched terms. Given how generic these terms are, this may suggest that people are looking for more help and assistance from us on getting started with benefits.
- "Forms" (~24K) is also high on the list, which suggests people want a full list of VA forms.
- Benefits-related terms like "direct deposit" (~13K), "cemetery" (~10K), and "certificate of eligibility" (~8K) are high on the list
- "DD214" (~9K) is high on the list, reflecting users desire to get their military records.

***3. How effective is VA.gov's search tool at providing the information users/veterans are seeking?***

- While click-through tracking has not been available as part of VA.gov's implementation of the Search.gov utility, there are indicators that site search is not as effective as it needs to be.  According to [two years of Google Analytics data (July 2018-July 2020)](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-site-search-overview/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20180726&_u.date01=20200726):
  - **Exits (Bounces):** The number of exits from VA.gov site that occurred following a result from an internal search: 48%
  - **Paging:** The average number of pages a user viewed after conducting a search: 3.36 (viewing 1 page is considered optimal)
  - **Average Search Depth** While the average search depth (e.g., The number of pages visitors viewed after getting results for the search term) is 1.50, some of VA.gov's most popular search terms show a far more significant search depth.

| \(Search Term \- Lowercase\) | Average Page Depth           |
|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| benefits                     | 2.28                         |
| ebenefits                    | 3.00                         |
| 22-1995                      | 9.30                         |
| certificate of eligility     | 3.62                         |
| aid and attendance           | 3.00                         |
| chapter 35                   | 7.83                         |
| dd214                        | 2.77                         |
| direct deposit               | 4.00                         |

  
  
***4. How often does a search request end in 0 result?***

(Note: Users have information needs they expect the site to satisfy, yet the site search utility is unable to serve them.  May also indicate misspellings or typos that youâ€™re not handling.)
  
***5. What is the average search depth for VA.gov?***

(Note: The number of pages viewed after performing a search. This is calculated as Sum of all search_depth across all searches / (search_transitions + 1)


***6. What is the average percentage of Search refinements -- e.g., the number of times a user searched again immediately after performing a search -- on VA.gov?***

(Note: Defined as the number of times a user searched again immediately after performing a search. Percentage Search Refinements = The percentage of searches that resulted in a search refinement. Calculated as Search Refinements / Pageviews of search result pages.)

The total number of times a refinement (transition) occurs between internal search keywords within a session is 30.55% 

***7.What is the average amount of time/duration users spend on VA.gov after performing a search.*** 

(Note: This is calculated as Sum of all search_duration across all searches / (search_transitions + 1)***

***8.What is the average number of search exits during a session on VA.gov*** 

(Note: The number of searches made immediately before leaving the site.)

***9.What is the Percentage of Search Exits on VA.gov*** 

(Note: Calculated as Search Exits / Total Unique Searches)


***10.How easy is it to find the Top Tasks via on-site search?***

(Note: This is the Big Question, and we need to align on what are the Top Tasks for VA.gov users -- e.g. the most important thing to a user when they are online and is the task they want to complete.   More about the Top Task framework -- and how to build alignment around it -- [is here](https://medium.com/@gerrymcgovern/identifying-customer-top-tasks-ee228206b6ed).   This framework goes beyond the tasks highlighted in the summary analytics report recently assembled by our [IA team here}(https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy+planning/analytics/top-task-analytics.md). )
