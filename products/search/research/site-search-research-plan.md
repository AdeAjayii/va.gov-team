# Research Plan for VA.gov Search Improvements

---- DRAFT ----

## Goals

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?

   Search enhancements for VA.gov, Public Websites

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?

   Since the release of the modernized VA.gov in November 2018, there has been no dedicated focus to optimize VA.gov's search experience. Analytics tells that search is a primary utility for the modernized VA.gov's users - from June 2019 to June 2020, ~10% of visitors used site search, and ~46% of site visitors come to VA.gov via organic search.

   We'd like to better understand Veteran's needs and expectations around our site search so we can improve our search experience, and more fully align with our North Star goals.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

   - What are people searching for on VA.gov? (From [top questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/search/research/top_questions.md))

   - How effective is VA.gov's search tool at providing the information people are seeking? (From [top questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/search/research/top_questions.md))
   - What, if any, painpoints do Veterans experience when using search?
   - What, if any, advanced search features do Veterans expect? (refinements, type ahead, etc)
   - Where do Veterans look for information if they don't find it via VA.gov search?
   - At what point in their visit do Veterans use site search?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?

   - Search inquiries will align with top tasks

   - Veterans will have the sentiment that VA.gov's search tool is ineffective because: 

     - they'll have too many results to sort through
     - The information they're looking for will not be immediately apparent
     - They won't have a way to refine their results

   - Pain points will align with ^

   - Veterans will expect filtering functionality on search results

   - Veterans will go to a search engine or decide to engage with a person if they don't find what they're looking for via site search

   - Veterans will use site search immediately when coming to VA.gov with task in mind, especially if they have not completed that task recently (or ever).
