# Research Plan for VA.gov Search Improvements

---- DRAFT ----

## Goals

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?

   Search enhancements for VA.gov, Public Websites

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?

   Since the release of the modernized VA.gov in November 2018, there has been no dedicated focus to optimize VA.gov's search experience. Analytics tells that search is a primary utility for the modernized VA.gov's users - from June 2019 to June 2020, ~10% of visitors used site search, and ~46% of site visitors come to VA.gov via organic search.

   We'd like to better understand Veteran's needs and expectations around our site search so we can improve our search experience, and more fully align with our North Star goals.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

   - What are people searching for on VA.gov? 
   - How effective is VA.gov's search tool at providing the information people are seeking?
   - At what point in their visit do Veterans use site search?
   - Do veterans see where they can use search? Or is the hidden input box make it harder to find and to utilize?
   - How can search results be improved to improve scanning behavior?
   - How do Veterans scan search results?
   - Is there a cognitive disconnect and/or issues for folks that the search results use such a tiny font compared to the rest of the site?
   - Do people understand the difference between “top recommendations” and the rest of the results and what are their thoughts on that?
   - Do people utilize or see “More VA search tools”? (get some data on the right rail)
   - Do veterans know about other search utilities - find a facility, yellow ribbon
   - How is the search experience different for Veterans across benefit hubs?
   - How do Veterans perceive the search experience on VA.gov?
   - What, if any, pain points do Veterans experience when using search?
   - How do those pain points differ from mobile to desktop?
   - What, if any, advanced search features do Veterans expect? (refinements, type ahead, etc)
   - Where do Veterans look for information if they don't find it via VA.gov search?
   - How do you see VA.gov search separate from google?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?

   - Search inquiries will align with top tasks.

   - Veterans will experience the following pain points: 

     - Too many results to sort through.
     - The information they're looking for will not be immediately apparent from the search titles and descriptions.
     - Not having a way to refine search results.

   - The above pain points will lead to Veterans perceiving our site search to be ineffective.

   - Veterans will expect filtering functionality on search results.

   - Veterans will go to a search engine or decide to engage with a person if they don't find what they're looking for via site search.

   - Veterans will use site search immediately when coming to VA.gov with a task in mind, especially if they have not completed that task recently (or ever).

   - Veterans use Google and online groups (such as Facebook or Reddit) for broader queries, and they come to VA.gov with more specific information in mind found through those other avenues.

   - Veterans likely won't pay attention to the label `Top Recommendations`; if they do, they won't understand it means.

   - Benefits that have a clear associated task, such as disability (filing a claim) are easier to navigate via search than education or another benefit that has multiple, or less clear, outcomes.

   - The way our search engine works is not up to people's expectations.
