With the goal of understanding and framing the problems to be solved, an upfront discovery process will be conducted, while some approved activities will be pursued as prioritized.   This "state of the state" process will include the following tasks:

- [x] Set-up Google Search Console and Bing Web Developer Tools to analyze trends, site health, etc.
- [Underway] Conduct scan of available data sources -- including Search.gov (on-site) and SEMRush, GSC, Bing (off-site) to surface key trends and insights to help with problem framing.
- [Underway] Review foundational components of VA.gov search -- e.g., sitemap xml, sub-domain indexing, site audit/health -- to determine if updates, fixes, enhancments are needed to improve search optimization.
- [Not Started] Talk to key stakeholders to gather information, data and observations on the VA.gov experience from unique perspectives 
- [Not Started] Determine in collabortion with Design/Research if [qualitative research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/design/vsa-research-process.md) -- e.g., user interviews or usability testing -- is needed to better establish the problem space.
