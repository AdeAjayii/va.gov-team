## Outreach Events Calendar Product Outline (v.1.0)

The VA.gov [Outreach Events calendar](https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/events/) was quickly built and released as an "at parity" MVP more product -- with very basic funcitonality -- more than <two> years ago.  Since that time, the popularity of the product has grown (to more than 200,000 page views on average per month [per Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=1#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20190701&_u.date01=20210722&explorer-table.filter=outreach-and-events~2Fevents~2F&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-graphOptions.selected=analytics.nthMonth)) and so have the needs and expectations of the VA business stakeholders.   Indeed, as of the spring of 2021, the Veterans Experience Office has broaded the [user base for the national events calendar to digital comms teams at VHA, VBA, OPIA and NCA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/outreach-events/business-users.md).

## The Problem to be Solved

**How might we make the process of creating or updating a VA.gov Home Page banner easier, faster and less risk-prone?**


## Proposed Solution(s)

**High Level User Story/ies**

As a content editor, I need to quickly publish error-free alerts on the VA.gov homepage at all hours, so that time sensitive information can reach Veterans.


**Requirements**


## Hypothesis or Bet

**If** we create a more robust, systematic approach to enabling HP banner alerts **then** we will reduce the litany of high profile risks (availability, timeliness, content errors) which exist now.


## Definition of done

**For Short Term Solution (Goal: Put in place by Sept. 1)**

- [ ] Set meeting with Platform for collaboration on improving communication, response, redundancy and speed to publish issues/gaps.
- [ ] Create tickets for solutioning

**For Mid Term Solution (Goal: Implement by Oct. 1)**

- [ ] Confirm recommended UX changes with Ryan T.
- [ ] Create ticket for backlog and implementation

**For Long Term Solution (Goal: Implement in Q1/2022)**

- [ ] Determine LOE for CMS solution and where it fits based on other CMS priorities
- [ ] Create ticket for backlog(s)
