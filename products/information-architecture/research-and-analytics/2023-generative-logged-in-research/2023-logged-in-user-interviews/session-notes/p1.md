# **Conversation Guide for Logged-in IA and Nav Wayfinding Study**

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yeah

**Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Before we start looking at the website, I want to learn a more about you. When the session was scheduled, you provided some information.

- I understand you are a [_Veteran_ Is that right? Yes
- And, according to my notes you have [_services/benefits from Perigean participant tracker_] through VA. Is that correct? Correct.
- Thanks for confirming that. Are there any other benefits or services that you receive? Uh, visual assistance is through the VA and I get the pain medication and community care where the VA doesn't provide it so I go outside for it. They keep changing the name.
- Do you manage or access that benefit or service online at all? Yeah my prescriptions and all that we do on my HealtheVet and uh checking for benefit updates or anything
- What are benefit updates: I have a claim in and I go to DoD to see where that's at. I am glad they changed it so I don't need to look for two dancing bears and all that.
- Security things: Yes.
  - _If needed:_ what website, do you use to do that? Uh va.gov, if I go to DoD it redirects to va.gov. when you go to DoD it provides options on how to login so I sue the DoD one than go to work in progress and it sends me to va.gov
- In order to join today's session, you needed to confirm you have a VA.gov account - tell me about the last time you logged into the account.
  - Why did you log on? I logged into it at last night around 7-8pm. With the site I tend to login after 8 because than it doesn't go round and round for a half hour. If you try to enter in the day, it takes longer because it is busy.
  - Helper: That's Bonnie, almost 54 years. Its funny two people can argue that long.
  - Bonnie do you help or login: I am with him as we go through it, he has had the claim in for some time and had disability that he is getting compensation but it was all filed at the same time then past the other part to a judge. We are old people so sometimes you need to do it together. We have been doing this for the last year and you have to be a wiz to upload the travel documents. He goes outside of the VA for his back but trying to get the letter uploaded for travel benefits is almost impossible. I couldn't do it because you have to go through the page so much and I have to have it so big I lose it.
  - What did you end up doing while logged on?

**Task 1: Complete benefit related task - 12 minutes / 24 min for screen reader sessions**

**Task goal:**  _See how they go about navigating to their task, ultimately on VA.gov. They may start with Google searching or something else, which is fine. Eventually, we'll need to guide them to logging in on VA.gov if they don't go there on their own. We'll also want to evaluate how they'd get to this task if they couldn't use the homepage or My VA_.

Thanks for sharing all of that with me. Now I'll have you share your screen in zoom. Do you know how to do that? If not, I can help you.

_Guide with screen sharing if needed_

I can see your screen, great! We can get start looking at websites now.

**If participant clearly stated a benefit or service, you could pull a task from:**  Now that you're logged in, can you show me how you [_use their language for what they ended up doing while logged in_]? It'll help if you can think out loud as much as possible.

**If participant does not have any recent experience with VA to pull from, pull logged-in task from Cindy's top task research findings:**  Imagine you wanted to get your VA medical history. Show me how you'd go about doing that. It'll help if you can think out loud as much as possible.

- _If needed,_
  - Tell them to open a browser
- Login process: I go to my internet, looking for VA home on web browser. Goes to home, VA DoD benefits. I clicked login and I am here, and I go down here to sign in with DS login. I authorize it and sometimes I can just go right to login and every 2-3 weeks I have to make that call to get the number. Then this comes up and I click skip. I than click continue. Access code received last time. I come to this, and I go to work in process, when it first comes up it isn't there than I go to that. Then claim and appeal, Then I come to va.gov and click it. See how complicated it is to get there. Now he's there to check the claim and status. During the day I could go round for a half hour sometimes.
  - Can you show me how you'd do that on the VA website? I would go to this first one and go to disability. Check your claim and appeal status. Then it goes right there but it's still going around so.
  - How did it feel: it was easier you didn't need to go through everything from site to site. It was just a few clicks and there you were.
  - Share the new health hub page with them if they land on current versions, and they have health care
    - va.gov/my-health/
- Travel pay: can he exit out of these so he doesn't have so many things. You go to access VA and go down here to sign in again.
- From VA can you find out reimbursement information: I guess here clicked on VA benefits for service members.
- Why in this section: well travel is a benefit. Is there a box at the top to put in benefits. If you look at this list, there is nothing that says travel or reimbursement and service member benefits there isn't anything and about VA doesn't have anything about travel. Okay maybe myHealtheVet. That's where he does his prescriptions.
- Where else would you look: what if you tried the search. Type travel. It comes up with a screen that says VA travel pay reimbursement and beneficiary travel system, that's were we go to key in the authorization. It looks like there would be less steps and have it set up under va.gov. if you had a button for travel you wouldn't need to go to the search box. A lot of guys I know wouldn't think of that or do that.
- Would you have done it without bonnie: eventually if I could have found it. It makes the screen 7X larger so the screen is bigger and that's how much he sees on the screen. That's what makes it difficult when there is so much to look at and with the vision loss if all choices were on the far left and he went there, even search, for the site you could find it there or click search to find what you wanted. Moving all over the screen is difficult for him.
- Guess work involved in going from side to side to see what may or may not be there. Sometimes you stumble upon it.
- Ideal for left side, list, links, bulleted list: It wouldn't matter as long as like the right side search contact us and profile, put it all on the left side column. That would be my favorite things. Even the things along the top like VA locations, my va. If it were all in one column. If it were all in the left side instead of spread across the page and on different lines it would be easier for me.
-

**! Stop the participant before they submit any applications or change their actual information!**

Thank you for showing that to me!

**If participant used a link from homepage or My VA:**  Can you show me how you'd do that if the link to [_service or benefit_] was missing from [_the homepage or My VA_]?

- _If needed_
  - I'd like to see if there is another way that works for you to get to that same information (_back them up to the homepage or My VA, whichever they used_)
  - Where else would you go, if that link was missing from the page?

Thanks, that is helpful to see.

**Task 2: Complete second benefit related task - 8 min / 16 min for screen reader sessions**

Now I'd like to see how you go about finding a something else on the website. _Ok for participant to start wherever they are on the website, or from a fresh browser if that's what they'd do._

**If participant clearly stated a benefit or service you can pull a task from:**  Thinking about your [_benefit or service_], are there other related things you need to do online, or that you had to do in the past? Show me how you'd go about doing that, and please continue thinking out loud. You're doing a great job with that.

Pay for college course: I think it would be under education and training so we went there. (Reading Page) you start with the GI bill.

What is it like to use ZoomText: I have 4 columns but I can only see two of them at a time without moving the page across the screen I can see VA benefits than education benefits but to get manage benefit and Gi bill comparison tool I need to move the screen. Some guys need to make it so big they can only see 1 screen, even for me to comfortably read this I have to make it bigger than this.

Does it help or hurt you ability: on something like this I would look at the whole thing because there must be more than 1 thing. I would move around the screen. Since there are two, I would see if there were more since there was room. That really is a good way for him to look at things because he would start from the left and its easy to go through that to see everything. It would be nice if travel were there. You would look left to right, and it is logical. It is like you are looking at an actual paper page. I do some hill stone college courses since they are free.

Where to find out how they would page for classes: I would start with how to apply which is in the second column over. (reading page) start with eligibility to see if you are eligible to use it. He could have his computer read that to him with ZoomText. He just clicks it.

D you use that feature regularly: I use it a lot.

Information you are seeing: I assure I could find it here if I went through all of these must be true before getting benefits. Then you would have to go through all of this. Then you get to apply. I didn't know spouses were eligibility for benefits. I think I have to be a certain level of disabled until you are eligible.

- _If needed,_
  - Guide away from MHV or eBenefits to VA.gov
  - Share the health hub page with them if they land on current version

**! Stop the participant before they submit any applications or change their actual information!**

Thank you for showing that to me!

**If participant used a link from homepage or My VA:**  Can you show me how you'd do that if the link to [_service or benefit_] was missing from [_the homepage or My VA_]?

- _If needed_
  - I'd like to see if there is another way that works for you to get to that same information (_back them up to the homepage or My VA, whichever they used_).
  - Where else would you go, if that link was missing from the page?

**Task 3: View dependents - 5 min / 10 min for screen reader session**

Now I'd like to for you to show me one last thing - how would you double check any dependents you have on file with VA?

How to check dependents on VA: I don't have all, well you have me. Yeah, she's dependent on me all the time.

How would you confirm that: I think there was a dependent thing down here. Family member benefits because that would be a dependent. I never really looked at that. VA caregiver support program, I never looked at that either. She's taken a few caregiver classes form the county, but we can never find out how to be a caregiver for VA. We even tried through red cross, and we contact them but don't hear anything. On this page benefits (Reading page) If we go to benefits for spouses m is that were it would be. This just talks in general it doesn't say anything about dependents. If there is something I need to go back and find it. Clicked on search box, typed number of dependents. Well, I am the one that keyed it in. I don't think I have any dependents on file because we don't have any children. Can you ask me the question again. So, I guess we failed because I don't know where to find that.

If you can't find something what do you do: Well, lots of times when I can't find something I will call or leave a secure message. They will point me in the right direction.

_Goal is to get them to this page: _[_https://www.va.gov/view-change-dependents/view_](https://www.va.gov/view-change-dependents/view)

Thank you for showing that to me!

**Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes**

Those are all the things I wanted you to show me on the website. Thanks for going through that with me! I have just a few more questions.

- I noticed when you couldn't find what you were looking for, you did XYZ. Can you share more about why you did that?
  - Was there anything else you wanted to do, but couldn't?
- What are other websites that you use a username and password to log on? We have a whole book of them. Most of the websites I login to I put remember me so I don't need to remember them.
- Banking site: He doesn't I do all of the banking online.
  - What do you expect to change when you log on to \_\_\_\_\_? Well if you don't sign in you cant get anywhere you cant go to account or bill pay or transfer until you login. Access to accounts only after logging in. Change profile.
  - More personal things: yes
  - What on the site indicates that change to you? Our account is Wells Fargo. The only thing that comes up is the main page to login and it has my suer name which is remembers and I key in the password and enter. Than it opens to the banking page and you can go to the account with a drop down and then what do you want to do, bill pay, transfer, set up new payee, new account. All of those different things.
  - After you logged in, how did your experience on VA.gov compare to that other website? VA.gov is more cumbersome than Wells Fargo banking. It is confusing because they have so much on the screen. Even wh3en you go to my HealtheVet it is fairly simple because we've used it for years. Once he is logged in it has the sections for secure messaging, pharmacy, and appointments so you can go to the main blocks. If we wanted to send a message to his coordinator or doctor he just clicks on that. Trying to do anything else like travel or claim, anything not included in those areas it is just so complicated to get to. They have changed some of it, when login into DoD you have to login, than go to somewhere else with another password, than check to make sure you pick your picture as a verification. That has been fixed which is great. The thing that the VA and a majority of websites don't understand that visually impaired is that the popup ads and those for him are really distracting because it is enlarged and if something pops up than the screen moves to that. The screen is constantly changing for him, and it is difficult for anything with screen readers.
  - Less cumbersome: no that was about it. With the VA the my HealtheVet site, the fact they start with three major blocks is a good thing because there are fewer choices which make it easier. If they could group things together like health benefits, education benefits, travel. Something that would define it and do drop downs for those for specifics.
  - How would this work: Apply for VA benefit. (Reading page) This would be helpful because it shows the next appointment. Then here you can go to secure messaging, refill prescription, request travel and medical records. I never knew this was here and travel never told us it was here.
  - Go to VA access to file a claim. File claim for first time. Okay so you go here than I use my HealtheVet to go in. Login redirect, it comes up, sign in.
  - Even when already signed in you have to do it again: right, that's the thing. There you go well. That's why when she does travel she tries to do it after 6pm. Try it again. \*Unable to process SAML request.

Let me try to go to page. Hmm. Okay. It went to benefits for some reason. So go through login again. Skip that. Continue. Dashboard. This isn't the site that normally comes up. Let me just get out of there. Okay this is the site that normally comes up and you click veteran travel claim entry and now you are at BTSS than go to access va. You always have to review the profile, every time you login and you go to dashboard or go make coffee. And now you wait more. Go take a shower. We do this and laugh about it. It just takes a long time during the day. Your are at the dash board and here are all of the claims. It doesn't show the appointments from last week. There should be appointments and you have to go through to find the appointments. If you can't find appointment you go to the appointment was not listed.

Community care listed or not: It is not I always have to create it. This was a VA appointment he had those, but it isn't there. It was last Friday. If it is an appointment in the community than you must upload proof of the appointment. Last Friday appointment isn't here because it hasn't been updated as complete but it won't show here until they update the appointment as completed.
