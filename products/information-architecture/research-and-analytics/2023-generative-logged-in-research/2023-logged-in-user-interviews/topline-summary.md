# Topline Summary for Logged-in IA and Nav Wayfinding Study
 April 2023

This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is **not the final result of working with the data discovered**. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes.

## Initial Findings
### Participants heavily relied on the homepage to navigate VA.gov, and My VA to a lesser degree.
- After signing in, people looked for the link to their task on My VA, or the homepage.
- They continued to return to the homepage, mostly using the site breadcrumbs.
- A couple of participants returned to My VA via the link in the navigation (not the personalized menu) instead of the homepage to look for additional links.

### When asked to find content without using links on the homepage or My VA, about half of the participants used the mega menu, and the other half used search.
- Participants easily found what they were looking for via the mega menu when links were surfaced at the second level. It was harder for people to find what they’re looking if the link wasn’t called out in the menu.
- When the mega menu failed, most people used search.
- Search worked well for most people who used it.
- A screenreader participant used Google search over navigation or VA.gov search, and found what they were looking for immediately, every time.

### All participants logged-in immediately after entering the site.
- They all expected to have to log in to see personalized information, and did so via the sign-in button in the header (not a CTA on a page anywhere else). 
- Some participants defaulted to starting on My HealtheVet; they signed in immediately there as well.

### Participants who were not able to find what they were looking for stated they would call VA to get help.
- Only X of X participants were not able to find what they were looking for (view dependents)
- It was surprising that no one said they’d try to use an external search engine to find the content.

### Participants understood that “logged in / authenticated” parts of the website were all about them, and the unauthenticated parts of the website were for a generic group of users.
- Multiple participants referred the personalized menu, My VA, and My HealtheVet as “my stuff” or “everything about me”.
- Participants understood that content available via the navigation menus was for all Veterans or potential VA beneficiaries. They felt it was appropriate to have that content and that it should be a accessible even though they were logged in.
- They did not differentiate or comment on the homepage content being personalized or not.
- No one expressed frustration or concern by encountering content that wasn’t personalized to them.
- Some people commented that it would be nice to have a link to personalized content, or that the link “should” be there.

### Participants expect to find dependent information in the profile, especially if they did not have any dependents themselves.
- They navigated there via the personalized menu
- Participants who had dependents for their compensation understood dependents were related to disability benefits, so they were less sure about whether it would be in a personalized page (they checked the My VA Payments section) or somewhere under the disability section of the benefit hub

### When asked how the logged-in experience of VA.gov compared to other websites they log in to, most participants said it was “okay”.
- Participants considered their banking website as an example when we asked this question.
- They commented that other websites they log into are all about them, and described being able to see only things that pertain to them.
- We can do better than “okay”.
