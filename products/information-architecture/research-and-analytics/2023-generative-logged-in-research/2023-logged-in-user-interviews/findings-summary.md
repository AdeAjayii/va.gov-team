## Research Goals
Our goal with this research was to identify problems and expectations with navigating the logged-in experience on VA.gov.

## Research Questions
### Navigation and wayfinding
* How do people navigate to tasks they came to VA.gov to complete? 
	* How do they navigate to those tasks without relying on homepage/My VA links?
* How do people navigate to personalized information?
- What do people do when they:
	- have trouble with the website
	- feel information is inaccurate
	- need help with something
	- can’t find what they need
	- have questions in general
* How can we make the site easier to navigate for logged-in users?

### Logged-in mental model and expectations
* What are people’s expectations of the website experience after they’ve logged in?
* How do people differentiate “logged in / authenticated” parts of the website, and “unauthenticated” parts of the website? 
* Does the current experience cause confusion?
* How do navigation needs and expectations differ between user types?

## Methodology 
We conducted sessions remotely via Zoom, using screen sharing to observe participants completing tasks related to their VA benefits. 
- 8 of 9 participants could recall tasks they had recently done online related to their VA benefits or services, and we asked them to demonstrate how they did that in the session.
- 1 participant, a Veteran’s family member, had never used a VA website to access benefits or services, so we asked them to go through tasks related to their Veteran’s benefits and services, as if they needed to do them on their behalf.
- If participants used a link from the homepage or My VA to get to their task, they were asked to show us how they would get there if the link wasn’t directly on that page. 
- 1 participant was not able to screen share, so their session was conducted verbally.

**Note:** During this testing, VA.gov was piloting a new version of the homepage, and a new health landing page.  Our participants were not exposed to either of these during our study. We tested with the current version of the homepage, and the My HealtheVet links on the site pointed to the My HealtheVet website.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. People will struggle finding what they’re looking for if they can’t use the homepage or My VA.
a. **Likely false:** While people used links from both pages to quickly navigate to their tasks, most were still able to use the mega menu or search to find what they were looking for.  People struggled when the thing they were looking for wasn’t surfaced on the homepage, My VA, or in the mega menu.
2. People will give up or call VA if they can’t find what they need on VA.gov.
a. **Likely true:**  Less than half (4 of 9) of our participants were not able to find what they needed during the session, and stated they would call VA, or take a break and try again later.
3. People’s expectations of a logged-in VA.gov experience will not be much different than the current experience.
a. **Maybe false:** Most participants shared a sentiment that their logged-in experience on VA.gov was acceptable, but had suggestions for increased personalization. They also articulated feeling a stronger sense of personalization and task-based focused on other websites they log into.
4. Navigation needs and expectations will be similar across user types.
a. **Likely false:** 2 participants were totally unfamiliar with VA.gov and were not able to find task-related information on the website. 7 participants had previous experience and were able to find the same information much more easily.

## Key Findings
TK

## Details of Findings 
### Though participants had different approaches to starting their journey, everyone logged in as a first step when they got to the website.
- 5 participants started directly on VA.gov.
	- All 5 typed the web address directly into the browser.
	- 4 of 5 quickly went directly to their task via My VA.
- 3 participants started on My HealtheVet (MHV).
	- All used a phrase in a search engine to find the MHV website.
	- All had to be directed to VA.gov by the moderator.
- 1 participant started on eBenefits.
	- They used a browser bookmark for eBenefits.
	- They had to be directed to VA.gov by the moderator.
	
Everyone expected to have to log in to see personalized information, and 7 of 9 did so via the sign-in button in the header.  
- No one had to be prompted to sign in. 
- 2 participants were already logged in when screen sharing began, so we could not tell what the clicked to log in.

### Once they got to VA.gov, participants used mixed methods to navigate to their tasks; the less familiar they were with VA.gov, the more they relied on the homepage or My VA.

8 of 9 participants were asked to complete a task that was linked from the homepage or My VA, so it was no surprise that they used that link to quickly get to their task.  When we asked them to find another way to get to the same information, we saw variations in how people navigated the website.

For subsequent tasks, 4 of 9 primarily used the mega menu to navigate, with site search as a back-up for tasks that were hard to find, like viewing dependents.  The ease with which people navigated with the menu depended on the context they had around their task, and if the task was surfaced in the second layer of the menu.

- When participants clearly understood the category for their task, they had no problem using the navigation menus.
- Participants had a harder time finding what they needed via the menu when: 
	- there could be multiple related categories (e.g. downloading benefit letters), or 
	- they didn't have enough context around (e.g. viewing dependents) 
- Participants had a 50% success rate finding what they needed via search; in some cases they struggled to find a keyword so their search produced no helpful results.

4 of 9 participants repeatedly returned to the homepage or My VA as a way to get to their tasks.
- P9 returned to the homepage via breadcrumbs or their back button
- P7 and P3 used the My VA link in the global heading, though P3 confused My VA and MHV, and did not intend to go to My VA.
- P6 continued to return to the VA.gov homepage through the “Benefits” link on the MHV homepage
- P3 and P6 were very unfamiliar with VA.gov, as well as any services other than health care. They moved around the site with a lot of hesitation, or not at all.

> Moderator: How would you find that information without the link on this page?
> P3:  I wouldn’t do anything. I would immediately say to myself check up here *in heading, clicks personalized menu,* where it takes me to my VA [participant used the phrase “My VA” to refer to My HealtheVet], and no other thought would come to my mind. I would never go on this site.

> Moderator: I noticed when you were on this website, and you couldn’t find what you were looking for, you didn’t use the navigation items, or search, up in the header.
> P6: No, I didn’t notice them *laughs.* I was actually afraid that if I clicked anything outside of this *mouses over 4 boxes on homepage* I would get signed out.


1 of 9 participants, a screenreader user, used Google searches to find tasks on VA.gov. The keywords they used pulled up VA.gov as the first or second result each time (they did not include va.gov in their search query), allowing them to efficiently get to where they wanted to go.
> There's a lot of stuff up there in the header that I try to avoid, like the headings and the menu, as much as possible, because of the amount of detail that's up there. A lot of times, it's just easier to do a search for it and get around that area. Otherwise, I’m not sure if I'll be clicking two or three levels past the initial heading point to find the item. - P2

### Participants who were not able to find what they were looking for stated they would call VA to get help.
3 of 10 participants were not able to find what they were looking for (view dependents), and stated they would call VA to complete their task.

> Well, I guess we failed, because I don’t know how we’d check that… Many times when I can’t find something, I’ll use secure messaging or call my VIST coordinator. He’s good on the computer and he’ll point me in the right direction. - P1

### Most participants clearly understood that “logged in / authenticated” parts of the website were all about them, and the unauthenticated parts of the website were generic and targeted toward everyone.
- Multiple participants referred the personalized menu, My VA, and My HealtheVet as “my stuff” or “everything about me”.
- Participants understood that content available via the navigation menus was for all Veterans or potential VA beneficiaries. Most felt it was appropriate to have that content, and that it should be a accessible even though they were logged in.
- One participant stated they the menus were personalized because they used the word “your” in the links.
- Most did not differentiate or comment on the homepage content being personalized or not. One participant referred to the homepage as a “dashboard” and felt it was personalized because it used the word “your”.
- No one expressed frustration or confusion by encountering content that wasn’t personalized to them, though some did get frustrated when they didn’t find personalized content where they expected it. They commented that it would be nice to have a link to personalized content, or that the link “should” be there.
- **There is a sentiment that the unauth homepage needs to remain available even when you are logged into the site.**
	- Does prove or disprove that?
	- Interesting when one man clicked to see the new homepage; he didn’t know how to use it

### Participants struggled to find dependent information, which wasn’t linked from the homepage, My VA, or the mega menu links.
- About half of the participants expected to find it in the profile, and navigated there via the personalized menu.
- Participants who had dependents for their compensation understood dependents were related to disability benefits, so they were less sure about whether it would be in a personalized page (they checked the My VA Payments section) or somewhere under the disability section of the benefit hub.
- 3 participants were not able to find the information.
- 7 participants found it by using search.
- 2 participants were looking for the term DEERS to help them verify dependents on file with VA.

### When asked how the logged-in experience of VA.gov compared to other websites they log in to, most participants said it was “okay”.
- Participants considered their banking website as an example when we asked this question.
- They commented that other websites they log into are more personalized, and all about them as soon as they’re logged in.
- 2 participants described the VA.gov logged-in experience as “cumbersome”
- We can do better than “okay”.

### Authenticating across multiple sites created a fractured experience, and made some participants feel frustrated or hesitant.
- Multiple participants shared frustration and/or confusion during the log in process, especially those who started on My HealtheVet and logged in with a MHV credential.
- We observed participants having to log in multiple times while searching for personalized information.
- One participant didn’t use the site navigation at all during the session.  When asked why, they stated it partially because they didn’t want to “click anything up there because it might sign me out again”
