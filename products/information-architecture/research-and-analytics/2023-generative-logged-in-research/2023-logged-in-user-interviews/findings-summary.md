## Research Goals
Our goal with this research was to identify problems and expectations with navigating the logged-in experience on VA.gov.

## Research Questions
### Navigation and wayfinding
* How do people navigate to tasks they came to VA.gov to complete? 
	* How do they navigate to those tasks without relying on homepage/My VA links?
* How do people navigate to personalized information?
- What do people do when they:
	- have trouble with the website
	- feel information is inaccurate
	- need help with something
	- can’t find what they need
	- have questions in general
* How can we make the site easier to navigate for logged-in users?

### Logged-in mental model and expectations
* What are people’s expectations of the website experience after they’ve logged in?
* How do people differentiate “logged in / authenticated” parts of the website, and “unauthenticated” parts of the website? 
* Does the current experience cause confusion?
* How do navigation needs and expectations differ between user types?

## Methodology 
We conducted sessions remotely via Zoom, using screen sharing to observe participants completing tasks related to their VA benefits. 
- 8 of 9 participants could recall tasks they had recently done online related to their VA benefits or services, and we asked them to demonstrate how they did that in the session.
- 1 participant, a Veteran’s family member, had never used a VA website to access benefits or services, so we asked them to go through tasks related to their Veteran’s benefits and services, as if they needed to do them on their behalf.
- If participants used a link from the homepage or My VA to get to their task, they were asked to show us how they would get there if the link wasn’t directly on that page. 
- 1 participant was not able to screen share, so their session was conducted verbally.

**Note:** During this testing, VA.gov was piloting a new version of the homepage, and a new health landing page.  Our participants were not exposed to either of these during our study. We tested with the current version of the homepage, and the My HealtheVet links on the site pointed to the My HealtheVet website.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. People will struggle finding what they’re looking for if they can’t use the homepage or My VA.
a. **Likely false:** While people used links from both pages to quickly navigate to their tasks, most were still able to use the mega menu or search to find what they were looking for.  People struggled when the thing they were looking for wasn’t surfaced on the homepage, My VA, or in the mega menu.
2. People will give up or call VA if they can’t find what they need on VA.gov.
a. **Likely true:**  Less than half (4 of 9) of our participants were not able to find what they needed during the session, and stated they would call VA, or take a break and try again later.
3. People’s expectations of a logged-in VA.gov experience will not be much different than the current experience.
a. **Maybe false:** Most participants shared a sentiment that their logged-in experience on VA.gov was acceptable, but had suggestions for increased personalization. They also articulated feeling a stronger sense of personalization and task-based focused on other websites they log into.
4. Navigation needs and expectations will be similar across user types.
a. **Likely false:** 2 participants were totally unfamiliar with VA.gov and were not able to find task-related information on the website. 7 participants had previous experience and were able to find the same information much more easily.

## Key Findings
To come when details are complete. 

## Details of Findings 
### Though participants had different approaches to starting their journey, everyone logged in as a first step when they got to the website.
- 5 participants started directly on VA.gov.
	- All 5 typed the web address directly into the browser.
	- 4 of 5 quickly went directly to their task via My VA.
- 3 participants started on My HealtheVet (MHV).
	- All used a phrase in a search engine to find the MHV website.
	- All had to be directed to VA.gov by the moderator.
- 1 participant started on eBenefits.
	- They used a browser bookmark for eBenefits.
	- They had to be directed to VA.gov by the moderator.
	
Everyone expected to have to log in to see personalized information, and 7 of 9 did so via the sign-in button in the header.  
- No one had to be prompted to sign in. 
- 2 participants were already logged in when screen sharing began, so we could not tell what the clicked to log in.

### Participants relied on the homepage and My VA to navigate less than we expected; instead they used a variety of methods to get to their tasks.

8 of 9 participants started their session with a task that was linked from the homepage or My VA, and it was no surprise that they used that link to quickly get to where they wanted to go.  When we asked them to find another way to get to the same information, and to complete other tasks later in the session, we saw variations in how people navigated the website.

4 of 9 primarily used the mega menu to navigate, with site search as a back-up for tasks that were hard to find, like viewing dependents.  The ease with which people navigated with the menu depended on the context they had around their task, and if the task was surfaced in the second layer of the menu.

Based on what we observed, the less familiar a person was with VA.gov, the more they relied on the homepage or My VA to navigate. 4 of 9 participants repeatedly returned to the homepage or My VA as a way to get to their tasks.
- P9 returned to the homepage via breadcrumbs or their back button
- P7 and P3 used the My VA link in the global heading, though P3 confused My VA and MHV, and did not intend to go to My VA.
- P6 continued to return to the VA.gov homepage through the “Benefits” link on the MHV homepage.
- P3 and P6 were very unfamiliar with VA.gov, as well as any services other than health care. They moved around the site with a lot of hesitation, or not at all.

> Moderator: How would you find that information without the link on [My VA]? 
> 
> P3: I wouldn’t do anything. I would immediately say to myself check up here *clicks personalized menu,* where it takes me to [My HealtheVet], and no other thought would come to my mind. I would never go on this site [VA.gov].

The 2 participants who relied on the homepage didn’t see My VA until the end of their session, when directed by the moderator. Both had positive reactions and felt My VA would have gotten them to where they wanted to go.

> I’d probably be able to find exactly what I was looking for [on My VA], without going through all these different things down here *mouses over links on homepage* - P6

1 of 9 participants, a screenreader user, preferred to use Google searches over other navigation methods. 
> There's a lot of stuff up there in the header that I try to avoid, like the headings and the menu, as much as possible, because of the amount of detail that's up there. A lot of times, it's just easier to do a search for it and get around that area. Otherwise, I’m not sure if I'll be clicking two or three levels past the initial heading point to find the item. - P2


### Navigating to tasks was challenging for participants who weren’t sure how their task was categorized within VA. 
Participants had a harder time finding what they needed via the navigation menu when: 
	- there could be multiple related categories (e.g. downloading benefit letters), or 
	- they didn't have enough context around the task (e.g. viewing dependents) 

Participants who tried to search for content had a 50% success rate finding what they needed; in some cases they struggled to find a keyword so their search produced no helpful results.

When participants clearly understood the category for their task, they had no problem using the navigation menus or generating helpful search results.

### Participants who were not able to find what they were looking for stated they would contact VA to get help.
3 of 10 participants were not able to find what they were looking for (view dependents), and stated they would contact VA to complete their task. As a secondary approach, one of the 3 said they might try google searching, and another said they might try again another time.

> Caregiver: I guess we failed, because I don’t know how we’d check that.
> 
> P1: Many times when I can’t find something, I’ll use secure messaging or call my VIST [Visual Impairment Services Team] coordinator. He’s good on the computer and he’ll point me in the right direction.

### Participants perceived authenticated parts of VA.gov as being personalized to them, and unauthenticated parts of the website as general information for anyone visiting the site.

All participants understood authenticated parts of VA.gov (My VA, profile, and various tools they encountered) were personalized to them. They called out specific things such as their claim status, appointments, the name tag content, and name in the global header as signifiers that they were logged-in and seeing personalized information.

> This is *my* VA. This is stuff that the VA is giving me, how the VA cares for me, the benefits that I get. - P7

> I’m looking for whether it’s my name, my disability percentage, my medications, my physicians name, I’m looking for that familiar thing to say, ‘ok you’re in the right place’. - P9

We asked participants to complete two tasks that required them to be logged in, and would take them to pages that don’t require authentication. Participants understood that content available via the navigation menus  was for all Veterans or potential VA beneficiaries, and wanted to have access to that content when logged in. However, they felt that more personalized information or links on those content pages would be helpful.

> I would like to be specific when I’m applying for anything. I felt that, ‘does this really apply to me as well’? Even though I fall into the spectrum of disability, how does that interact with my caregiver benefit? That is where, it was just not giving me that specific information, and that’s why I didn’t feel confident. - P15, trying to understand how other benefits apply to a participant in the VA Caregiver Program

> When I went to education and employment. It talked about GI Bill, but they should know if I’ve already redeemed such and what other educational benefits I might be entitled to. - P5, reflecting on education pages

> It’s explaining eligibility, but if I want to go to *mine*, it would be nice if there was a link if you want to see your benefits. - P7, on education eligibility content page

### Participants struggled to find dependent information, which wasn’t linked from the homepage, My VA, or the mega menu links.

We asked 8 of 9 participants to show us how they would double check if VA had any dependents on file for them (1 participant did not have time for this task in their session). All 8 struggled to find this information, and 4 were not able to complete the task.

- 3 confidently checked their profile first, expecting to find their dependents listed there. These 3 participants had varying levels of familiarity with the website. They also all receive disability compensation from VA, so are more likely to correlate dependents with disability than Veterans who do not receive this benefit.
- 2 participants tried looking under “Family member benefits”
- 1 looked under “Service member benefits”
- 2 participants were scanning pages for the term DEERS, thinking that would help them find the information
- 2 successfully used search because they weren’t sure how else to find it.

> That should be under my profile, or in one of these things here *mousing over My VA sections* because it is basic information about who is loaded. For me, *hesitates,* for disability I get it for my spouse… I don’t know if it would be under disability. *Scrolling up and down My VA* Yeah, I don’t know. 
> 
> *Eventually finds View Dependents page via search*
> 
> That was very painful, and it should not be that hard to find. - P7


### When asked how the logged-in experience of VA.gov compared to other websites they log in to, most participants said it was “okay”.
- Participants considered their banking website as an example when we asked this question.
- They commented that other websites they log into are more personalized, and all about them as soon as they’re logged in.
- 2 participants described the VA.gov logged-in experience as “cumbersome”
- We can do better than “okay”.

### Authenticating across multiple sites created a fractured experience, and made some participants feel frustrated or hesitant.
- Multiple participants shared frustration and/or confusion during the log in process, especially those who started on My HealtheVet and logged in with a MHV credential.
- We observed participants having to log in multiple times while searching for personalized information.
- One participant didn’t use the site navigation at all during the session.  When asked why, they stated it partially because they didn’t want to “click anything up there because it might sign me out again”


## Additional Insights

## Recommendations

- **There is a sentiment that the unauth homepage needs to remain available even when you are logged into the site.**
	- Does prove or disprove that?
	- Interesting when one man clicked to see the new homepage; he didn’t know how to use it
	
## Research Process Insights
## Further research needed
### We should recruit for the underserved groups we didn’t get to talk to in this round in our next study.
Including these people in our next round of research will help our team get a diverse group of perspectives.

## Next Steps
- Review with product team and align on recommendations we’ll take action on.
- Share findings with OCTO stakeholders
- Complete synthesis for holistic logged-in IA research effort
