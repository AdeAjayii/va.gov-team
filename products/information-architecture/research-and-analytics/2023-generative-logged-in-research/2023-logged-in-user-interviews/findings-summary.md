## Research Goals
Our goal with this research was to identify problems and expectations with navigating the logged-in experience on VA.gov.

## Research Questions
### Navigation and wayfinding
* How do people navigate to tasks they came to VA.gov to complete? 
	* How do they navigate to those tasks without relying on homepage/My VA links?
* How do people navigate to personalized information?
- What do people do when they:
	- have trouble with the website
	- feel information is inaccurate
	- need help with something
	- can’t find what they need
	- have questions in general
* How can we make the site easier to navigate for logged-in users?

### Logged-in mental model and expectations
* What are people’s expectations of the website experience after they’ve logged in?
* How do people differentiate “logged in / authenticated” parts of the website, and “unauthenticated” parts of the website? 
* Does the current experience cause confusion?
* How do navigation needs and expectations differ between user types?

## Methodology 
We conducted sessions remotely via Zoom, and asked participants to log into VA.gov to complete tasks. The tasks were a combination of specific tasks based on the participant’s experience with VA, and pre-defined tasks we asked all participants to complete.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. People will struggle finding what they’re looking for if they can’t use the homepage or My VA.
*Somewhat true*
2. People will give up or call VA if they can’t find what they need on the VA.gov.
*Mostly true*
3. People’s expectations of a logged-in VA.gov experience will not be much different than the current experience.
*Somewhat true*
4. Navigation needs and expectations will be similar across user types.
*Definitely true*

## Further research needed
### We should recruit for the underserved groups we didn’t get to talk to in this round in our next study.
Including these people in our next round of research will help our team get a diverse group of perspectives.

## Next Steps
- Review with product team and align on recommendations we’ll take action on.
- Share findings with OCTO stakeholders
- Complete synthesis for holistic logged-in IA research effort
