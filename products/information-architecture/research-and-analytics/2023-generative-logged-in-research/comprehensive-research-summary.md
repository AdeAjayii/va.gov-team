# Logged-in IA and Nav Comprehensive Research Summary
Last updated: April 26, 2023

Liz Lantz, Authenticated Experience

## Background
While we’ve observed some high-level problems people have navigating VA.gov’s logged-in experience (eg. people are reliant on homepage and My VA links), we hadn’t conducted research that is solely dedicated to this topic. To remedy this, we conducted research to help us clarify exactly what problems exist with the logged-in navigation, where we are not meeting users’ expectations, and what we might do to improve the overall experience. 

These are the specific things we wanted to gain insights on through this work:

* Understand what motivates people to login, when in a flow they login, and where (eg. homepage, etc).
* Understand what issues people have navigating to tools and tasks when they are logged in to VA.gov.
* Understand what peoples’ expectations are for navigating to tools and tasks when they are logged in to VA.gov.
* If applicable, extrapolate learnings to logged out flows as well instead of thinking of wayfinding as two distinct or competing experiences (unauth vs. auth).
* Determine if there is a difference in what people do logged in vs. logged out on VA.gov (not what they *can* do, but what they expect/want to do).

## Answers to research questions
### What motivates people to log in? When and where do they log in during their flow?
- People are motivated to log in by having to complete a personalized task, such as refilling a prescription or checking the status of their claim. 
- They come to the site knowing they’ll have to sign in, so they go ahead and get it done as a first step, on the homepage.  We observed this for people who start on VA.gov, MHV, and eBenefits.

	-  [Analytics shows the homepage is the most popular page to sign in on by far](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/analytics-review-findings.md#what-are-the-top-ten-popular-pages-for-people-to-sign-in-on) 

### What issues do people have navigating to tools and tasks when they are logged in to VA.gov?
* People have a hard time navigating to things when they don’t cleanly fall into one category or topic area (e.g downloading benefit letters). It’s even harder when those things are not linked from the homepage or called out in the mega menu, like viewing dependents.
	* We observed this in our user interviews ( [finding](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/2023-logged-in-user-interviews/findings-summary.md#navigating-to-tasks-was-challenging-for-participants-who-werent-sure-how-their-task-was-categorized-within-va) )
	* This also came up in our [previous research review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/research-review-findings.md#what-are-the-known-challenges-do-people-have-navigating-the-logged-in-experience-eg-reliance-on-homepagemy-va-links).
* People get frustrated, or feel like they’re on a generic website, when personalized content isn’t surfaced while trying to complete a task

* People called out redundancies and complexities in navigation options when logged in ( [user interview finding](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/2023-logged-in-user-interviews/findings-summary.md#5-of-9-participants-talked-about-redundancies-and-complexities-while-navigating-the-va-website-after-logging-in) )
* During [user interviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/2023-logged-in-user-interviews/findings-summary.md#participants-relied-on-the-homepage-and-my-va-to-navigate-less-than-we-expected-instead-they-used-a-variety-of-methods-to-get-to-their-tasks), we observed that people who aren’t familiar with the website, such as My HealtheVet users or non-Veterans, have a hard time finding anything that’s not linked from the homepage or My VA.

### What are people’s expectations are for navigating to tools and tasks when they are logged in to VA.gov?
Based on our [previous research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/research-review-findings.md#what-are-other-known-insights-around-navigating-the-site-overall) and  [user interviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/2023-logged-in-user-interviews/findings-summary.md#participants-perceived-authenticated-parts-of-vagov-as-being-personalized-to-them-and-unauthenticated-parts-of-the-website-as-general-information-for-anyone-visiting-the-site), we know people expect:
- personalized links and content to be surfaced throughout the VA website if they are logged in
- to be able to be able to navigate to content about benefits and eligibility (broader, generic information) even when they’re logged in

We also know that people find it helpful, and have an increased sense of personalization, when they have access to all their tasks in one place, especially immediately after logging in.

	- My VA ranks within the top 10 pages for logged-in sessions, even without the redirect parameter appended to the URL ([analytics report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/analytics-review-findings.md#what-are-the-25-most-popular-pages-visited-while-signed-in))

### Is there a difference between what people do logged-in vs logged out?

The qualitative research included in this effort didn’t specifically ask users about a logged out state. Based on analytics, we can infer when people are logged out, they’re in learning or research mode. The facility locator, content pages about the PACT Act and COVID-19, and search are in the top pages.  When logged-in they’re focused on completing personalized tasks, though still expect to be able to research more generic information ([user interviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/2023-logged-in-user-interviews/findings-summary.md#participants-perceived-authenticated-parts-of-vagov-as-being-personalized-to-them-and-unauthenticated-parts-of-the-website-as-general-information-for-anyone-visiting-the-site)).
- [25 popular pages when signed in](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/analytics-review-findings.md#what-are-the-25-most-popular-pages-visited-while-signed-in)
- [25 popular pages when signed out](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/analytics-review-findings.md#what-are-the-25-most-popular-pages-visited-while-signed-out)

### How can we apply what we’ve learned to logged-out flows?
It depends on what the goals are around logged-out flows.  If we’re considering logged-out flows in a logged-in state, we can work to identify places on VA.gov where we can do a better job prioritizing personalized information in places that are also part of the unauthenticated experience, such as in the benefit hubs and possibly even in the navigation.

Since the research was primarily focused on logged-in flows, we’ll need to learn more about logged-out flows to better understand how what we learned could improve the UX in that area. 

## Problems we’ve identified with the logged-in experience
### Logged-in users are experiencing different levels of personalization on VA.gov, depending on where they start and how familiar they are with the website.

### It’s hard to find personalized content when it’s not obviously linked from the homepage, My VA, or the mega menu.

### My VA, and possibly profile, are missing some personalized content people expect to find there.

### Logging-in to different websites to complete personalized tasks is challenging and frustrating.

### Having 4 options to sign in with is confusing for people.
