# Logged-in IA and Nav Comprehensive Research Summary
`draft`

April XX, 2023

## Background
While we’ve observed some high-level problems people have navigating VA.gov’s logged-in experience (eg. people are reliant on homepage and My VA links), we hadn’t conducted research that is solely dedicated to this topic. To remedy this, we conducted research to help us clarify exactly what problems exist with the logged-in navigation, where we are not meeting users’ expectations, and what we might do to improve the overall experience. 

These are the specific things we wanted to gain insights on through this work:

* Understand what motivates people to login, when in a flow they login, and where (eg. homepage, etc).
* Understand what issues people have navigating to tools and tasks when they are logged in to VA.gov.
* Understand what peoples’ expectations are for navigating to tools and tasks when they are logged in to VA.gov.
* If applicable, extrapolate learnings to logged out flows as well instead of thinking of wayfinding as two distinct or competing experiences (unauth vs. auth).
* Determine if there is a difference in what people do logged in vs. logged out on VA.gov (not what they *can* do, but what they expect/want to do).
