# Health Portal Integrated Navigation

## Secondary navigation overview:

The existing sidenav component is not fully supported by the Design System, thus implementations are likely inconsistent across VA.gov. The component was created to mimic the sidenavigation native to VA.gov's content management system (CMS), Drupal. Most pages across VA.gov display the Drupal version.

### Design concerns



## Needs for secondary navigation
* Must allow users to move from one tool to another seamlessly
* Must be placed consistently on the page (across all modalities), with all health tools persistently available and visible to the user
* Must consider its relationship to the primary site navigation (mega menu)
