###### Page Structure:

###### URL and breadcrumbs:



1. Order CPAP Devices - New
* URL: va.gov/health-care/[H1 TBD by content]
* Breadcrumb: Home > Healthcare > [H1 TBD by content]
* Notes: Let’s use whatever the content team decides for the H1 to match as closely as possible with breadcrumb and url, but it will probably be something like /order-CPAP

<!--H6 not demoted to H7. -->


###### Entry points:



1. Left Nav - Add
* Placement description: In ‘Manage Benefits’ between ‘Order hearing aid batteries and accessories’ and ‘Order prosthetic socks’
* Link label: [TBD by content]
* Link destination: va.gov/health-care/[H1 TBD by content]

<!--H6 not demoted to H7. -->


###### Redirects:

No redirects, since this is a new page. 

Next IA steps for product team:



1. Add new CPAP page + content
2. Add CPAP entry point to left nav
3. Add CPAP questions to hearing aid form to combine them
4. Update find-a-form page to include CPAP
