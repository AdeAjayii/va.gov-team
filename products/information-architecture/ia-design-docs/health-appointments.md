# IA Design for Appointments
**STATUS: In Progress**

**Team:** Appointments

**On this page:**
- [Page structure](#map
- [URLs and breadcrumbs](#url)
- [Entry points](#nav)
- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Meeting notes](#notes)


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

![IA of appointments](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122126772/4bc9b61e-3e9f-45e8-bce6-a2274751118b)

Note: the URL for the after-visit summary is still TBD. It could be just an ID based URL like /123456, or it could have a label on it, like /visit-summary-123456. 


## <a name="main urls"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs - Main Pages
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

Page | URL | Breadcrumb | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Appointments Landing Page | TBD | TBD |
Appointments Detail View | TBD | TBD  | 
Cancel Appointment | TBD | TBD | we are recommending that this functionality moves from a modal to a page to improve a11y
Schedule Appointment | TBD | TBD | Subsequent steps of the flow can follow normal url building guidelines, which can be found in the design system: https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/url-standards



## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>
These will be documented and updated according to the Phased Rollout Plan.
 

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>
We will need to redirect all of the existing appointments and scheduling URLs to the new assigned URLs
