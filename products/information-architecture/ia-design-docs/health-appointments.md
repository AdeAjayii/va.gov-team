## <a name="flows"></a>User/page flows <br>
*Illustration and/or description of how users will flow through the experience. The user flow helps illustrate how visitors will navigate to and through your product/feature, ensures all types of visitors and scenarios are accounted for, and aids in identifying all content and messaging needs.*


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

ADD SCREENSHOT!!!


## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs
*URL and breadcrumb requirements for each modified or new page within the experience. URLs and breadcrumbs must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

Page | URL | Breadcrumb | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Appointments DEFAULT View | www.va.gov/my-health/appointments?view=upcoming | Home > My HealtheVet> Appointments | 
Appointments PENDING View | www.va.gov/my-health/appointments?view=pending | Home > My HealtheVet> Appointments | Filter changes the url, but not the breadcrumb
Appointments PAST View | www.va.gov/my-health/appointments?view=past | Home > My HealtheVet> Appointments | Filter changes the url, but not the breadcrumb
Appointments Detail View | www.va.gov/my-health/appointments/detail?id=[ID Number]&view=[View type] | Home > My HealtheVet > Appointments > [Appointment Title] | The ID is dynamic and pulled in for each unique appointment. The view depends on the appointment type, whether it's upcoming, pending, past, or cancelled. For example, www.va.gov/my-health/appointments/detail?id=123456&view=upcoming
Cancel Appointment |  |  | None needed, since the cancellation flows are in a modal
Schedule Appointment | www.va.gov/my-health/appointments?view=upcoming | Home > My HealtheVet> Appointments |
