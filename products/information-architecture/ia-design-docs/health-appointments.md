**STATUS: In Progress**

**Team:** Appointments

- [URLs and breadcrumbs](#url)
- [Entry points](#nav)
- [Redirects](#redirects)
- [Meeting notes](#notes)


## <a name="map"></a>Page structure<br>
*Illustration and/or description of where this product/feature will live within the overall IA of VA.gov (i.e. a site map). The placement of your product/feature determines the URL structure, breadcrumb, and navigational needs of the product/feature, and provides search engines with relationship information that impacts overall SEO and findability. Placement of a product/feature must follow established patterns and standards of the existing site.*

![IA of appointments](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/122126772/4bc9b61e-3e9f-45e8-bce6-a2274751118b)

Note: the URL for the after-visit summary is still TBD. It could be just an ID based URL like /123456, or it could have a label on it, like /after-visit-summary-123456.
