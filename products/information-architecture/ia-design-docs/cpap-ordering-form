## <a name="url"></a>URLs and breadcrumbs

**1) [Order CPAP Devices] - [New]**

-   URL: va.gov/health-care/[H1 TBD by content]

-   Breadcrumb: Home > Healthcare > [H1 TBD by content]

-   Notes: Let's use whatever the content team decides for the H1 to match as closely as possible with breadcrumb and url, but it will probably be something like /order-CPAP

## <a name="nav"></a>Entry points <br>

1. **[Left Nav]** - [Add]

-   Placement description: In 'Manage Benefits' between 'Order hearing aid batteries and accessories' and 'Order prosthetic socks'

-   Link label: [TBD by content]

-   Link destination: va.gov/health-care/[H1 TBD by content]

## <a name="redirects"></a>Redirects <br>

No redirects, since this is a new page.


Next IA steps for product team:

1.  Add new CPAP page + content

2.  Add CPAP entry point to left nav

3.  Add CPAP questions to hearing aid form to combine them

4.  Update find-a-form page to include CPAP
