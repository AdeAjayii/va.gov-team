Conversation Guide: Pre-Need Eligibility Determination Application (VA Form 40-10007), Usability Research of Pre-Integration Enhancements, June 2023
Moderator logistics
•	Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
•	Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).
•	Mute your Slack and computer notifications.
Before you start the session
•	Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute.
•	In the Audio section, tap the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked.
•	Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure they are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare.
•	Check to make sure participants will be able to share their screen in Zoom (Share Screen button, Advanced Sharing Options)
•	When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro.
Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes
•	[Moderator turns on camera. Waits to admit observers until consent is received from participant]
•	Thanks for joining us today! My name is [moderator name] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to review a prototype of the VA pre-need application for eligibility determination at a VA national cemetery. We're working on improvements to the form, so it's important that we get feedback from users.
•	This entire session should take about 45 minutes or less. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question.
•	You'll be taking a look at a prototype of the application. This prototype is basically made up of images or mockups so none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits and none of your details are collected at any point or associated to your comments. As you click through the prototype, the fields will prefill with test data.
•	If, for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
•	Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
o	If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
o	If yes: Admit observers.
o	Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
o	Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth. Moderator can turn off camera.
•	Are you on a desktop, mobile or tablet device?
•	I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open.
If they have trouble locating the chat or with sharing, talk them through finding the chat window to locate the prototype link and the Zoom screen sharing features. Zoom share screen directions
Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording.
•	Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin.
Pre-Integration v0.1 InVision Prototype UT Link
Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:
Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
•	[Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?
Recording Instructions
•	Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
o	If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
o	If no: That's ok. We can use our notes to complete our analysis.
If yes, start recording to the Cloud.
•	I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"
•	Ok. Now we're really ready to begin!
Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
•	To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
•	Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? [Determine if they're a Veteran, family member, or a personal representative]
o	“I’m a vet getting ready to retire after 24 years. I heard about this through a LinkedIn connection. I’m about to be more dependent on VA products.”
•	Did you know that you could apply to see if you're eligible to be buried in a national cemetery at any time? - If so, how did you find out?
o	“I didn’t. It was something new I wanted to see what it was about.”
•	What do you think qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery?
o	“Just being a service member and you passed away during war.”
•	When thinking about planning for your burial, would you prefer to be buried in a national cemetery?
o	“I just assumed it just happened. I didn’t know you have to apply.”
•	Have you applied before to see if you're eligible for burial in a national cemetery?
o	If Yes: Could you describe how that process went and your thoughts about it?
o	If No: Is that something you would be interested in doing at some point?
	“I have not applied. I would be interested. Easier on my family and people I could count on if that happened.”
Getting Started - 1 minute
•	When applying to see if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery, the VA Pre-Need application can be used. I'm going to give you a scenario for you to walk through a prototype of this application and give us your thoughts.
•	The prototype link I shared is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable and some will not and some fields will fill in when you click on them.
•	While you're going through the scenario, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn, so we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
•	When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way.
[Note: Each participant will go through ONE of the tasks below.]

Post-Task Interview - 5-10 minutes
Wonderful! Thank you so much for walking through that with us and telling us your thoughts. We just have a few questions to ask before we wrap up our session for today.
•	What did you think of the application process overall?
o	“Easy enough. Seems in line with each of the services and benefits you apply for. Nothing outlandish for this eligibility. Straight to the point.”
•	On a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest, how would you rate the application process for Pre-Need that you just experienced?
o	“5. Even my small concern of having documents prepared before, you can still save.”
•	On a scale of 1 to 5, how mobile-friendly do you think it is?
o	“5. Easy.”
•	If you could snap your fingers and recreate the application process for pre-need to make it better, what would that process look like?
o	“Nothing really. Everything was pre-populated which made it easy. If it wasn’t, it would take me longer. Nothing too complicated except service periods for my situation.”
o	How would you do things differently?
•	Is there anything else on your mind that we didn't ask?
o	“No. You guys are doing a great job.”
•	Do you have any questions for me?
Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes
•	Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the VA.gov Pre-Need application to make sure that it really works for Veterans.
•	Thanks so much! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
•	Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
