# Research Plan for MBS Self-Service Team, Application for Pre-Need Eligibility Determination (VA Form 40-10007), May 2023

## Background
The National Cemetery Administration (NCA) is working to modernize its systems, including the system that processes pre-need applications (VA Form 40-10007) for determining eligibility for burial in a VA national cemetery. Presently, pre-need cases are processed in the newly-modernized system and in the legacy system. Analysits are swiveling between the two systems to manage cases, which impacts timeliness measures for Eligibility Office (EO) analysts and Scheduling Office (SO) agents at the National Cemetery Scheduling Office (NCSO). Ultimately, users applying for pre-need are impacted, as eligibility determinations are delayed due to longer proccessing times.

The Application for Pre-Need Eligibility Determination (VA Form 40-10007) is offered to Veterans, service members, family members, and representatives as both authorized/unauthorized experiences, and it is accessible through the Burials and Memorials hub page. 

Based on discovery research and the overall goals for the project, our plan is to: 
1. Release incremental enhancements in a "Pre-Integration" phase (before the application is integrated with related systems) due to limitations with the legacy system, **and to** 
2. Release enhancements in an "Integration" phase in which the form will be fully integrated with modernized and legacy systems to allow for faster case processing

### OCTO Priorities 
This research supports the following 2023 OCTO objectives:
  * Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran Journey
The Pre-Need application applies to life stages from **Serving** onward to **Dying**, as service members, Veterans, family members, and representatives may apply at any time to determine if applicants are eligible for burial in VA national cemeteries. 

## Research Goals / Questions	
The goals of this user research are to: 
  * Learn how users experience applying for pre-need to identify improvements that can be made to address usability pain points, address user feedback/concerns, improve the rate of mobile applications, and improve its fairly low submission rate
    * What's working well for users and what are the pain points they're experiencing when applying for pre-need eligibility determination?
    * Why are most users applying through desktop devices, and how can we improve rates for mobile applications and successful submissions overall?
    * Since the majority of users are in the upper age brackets (35+ years old), what enhancements can we make to improve the application process for them?
  * Understand if the pre-need application is confusing for users in the entering of their details, as information is collected for up to three people in the form (applicant, sponsor, preparer), and determine which enhancements could mitigate confusion and reduce form entry errors
    * Which areas of the pre-need application are potentially confusing for users, particularly in determining whose details they need to enter throughout the form?
    * Do they understand the difference between an Applicant, a Sponsor, and a Preparer, and is it simple for them to determine in which sections of the form they need to provide these details?
    * Do they understand which option to select for the applicant's relationship to the service or Veteran (I am the service member or Veteran, Spouse or surviving spouse, Unmarried adult child, Other)?
  * Since the pre-need application contains potentially sensitive questions and because it deals with a sensitive topic overall, determine how the application process and content presented to users in the form can be improved to reduce or eliminate any discomfort users may experience when applying
    * Which areas of the form, if any, do users find particularly sensitive?
    * Does the pre-need form content meed user needs in this particularly sensitive application process? If not, how can it be improved to address user needs?  

### Outcome
Since we are limited in how much can be manipulated in the current form pre-integration without breaking the legacy system, this research will help in identifying what is working in the current form and if user pain points exist that we can then fully address for the integration phase if we are unable to address them pre-integration. 

### Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that users might: 
- Find the mobile experience unfavorable, as certain pages of the application are particularly lengthy
- Experience frustration with specific parts of the UI, such as with uploading supporting documents, due to being limited to one file type due to the legacy system
- Deem certain parts of the form as too insensitive, and they may wonder why they have to provide that information, particularly questions centered around the death of family members and other demographic questions
- Be confused by the different terminology in the form, causing them to wonder where they need to enter specific information or which options they should select

## Methodology	
Moderated usability testing with Zoom on mobile, depending on what Perigean recommends

### Location
Remote location with the preferred video conferencing software as Zoom

### Research materials
For moderated usability tests: 
- [Link to conversation guide - TBD](Url goes here)
- [Link to Pre-Need Pre-Integration prototype](https://vaselfservice.invisionapp.com/console/share/BGYS6FJQ49H) - This prototype contains content and accessibility enhancements that we're able to implement pre-integration without damaging our legacy system
	
## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We’d like to recruit 9 Veterans, family members,  for a total of 6-8 completed sessions. We’ll use Perigean to recruit participants.

### Recruitment criteria 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- Amount: Target is 6-8 participants but recruit 9
- Age ranges: 
    * Around 80% 35+
    * Around 20% 18-34
- Types: 
    * Three to four service members and Veterans 
     	- Age 55+, Black, male 
    	- Age 35-54+, White, female, assistive tech user 
     	- Age 18-34, Hispanic, male 
    * One spouse or surviving spouse of a service member of Veteran (A **spouse** is a person who is or was legally married to a service member or Veteran. A **surviving spouse** is someone who was legally married to the service member or Veteran at the time of their death and includes a surviving spouse who remarried.)
     	- Any age, LGBTQ+, female
    * One representative (a person filling out pre-need form on behalf of applicant, such as a **preparer**)
     	- Age 35+, Asian, Male 
    * One unmarried adult child (An **unmarried adult child** is an individual who became physically or mentally disabled permanently and incapable of self-support before the age of 21, or before 23 years of age if pursuing a full-time course of instruction at an approved educational institution.)
     	- Age 18-20 or 18-22 if pursuing degree
    * One parent of a service member or Veteran (considered a Corey Shea Act applicant)
     	- Age 40+
    * One person interested in pre-need eligibility determination

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
