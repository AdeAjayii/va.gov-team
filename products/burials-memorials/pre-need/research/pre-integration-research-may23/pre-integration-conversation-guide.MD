## Moderator Logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._
- _Before the session, send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel)._
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Audio section, tap the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure they are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Cindy/Charlie and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to review a prototype of the pre-need application. We're working on improvements to the form, so it's important that we get feedback from users.

- This entire session should take about 1 hour or less (2 hours for participants using a screenreader). I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- You'll be interacting with a prototype of the application. This prototype is made up of images that may not function exactly the way you expect. Since you'll be interacting with images, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits, and some areas are prefilled with test data. 
- To protect your privacy, none of your details are collected, and you will see things prefilled with that test data throughout the prototype as you click on things. 
- Please talk aloud as you're looking through the pages. For example, you could say "now I'd click on this, because I'd expect it to do this..." This helps me understand what's going through your head while using the tool.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features.**

**I'm going to send you a link in the chat.**
_Can actually do this as I’m explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end I’m looking at their screen, then I can move onto recording._
