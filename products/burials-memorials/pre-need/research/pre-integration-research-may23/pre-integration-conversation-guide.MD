# Conversation Guide: Pre-Need Eligibility Determination Application (VA Form 40-10007), Usability Research of Pre-Integration Enhancements, June 2023

## Moderator Logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).
- - Mute your Slack and computer notifications.

### Before you start the session
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Audio section, tap the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure they are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [moderator name] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to review a prototype of the VA pre-need application for eligibility determination at a VA national cemetery. We're working on improvements to the form, so it's important that we get feedback from users.
- This entire session should take about 1 hour or less [2 hours for participants using a screenreader]. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question.
- You'll be taking a look at a prototype of the application. This prototype is basically made up of images or mockups so none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits and none of your details are collected at any point or associated to your comments. As you click through the prototype, the fields will prefill with test data. 
- If, for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**I'm going to send you a link in the chat that I would like for you to open.**
_Can actually do this while explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end we're looking at their screen, then move onto recording._

-Okay, now I'm going to ask you to share your screen in Zoom so that we can look at the prototype together and then we'll begin. 

**Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features.** [Zoom share screen directions](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen-or-desktop-on-Zoom)

[Pre-Integration v0.1 InVision Prototype UT Link](TBD)

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You can tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
    - If no: **That's ok. We can use our notes to complete our analysis.** 

*If yes, start recording to the Cloud.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"** 

Ok. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
- To start, I'd like to ask you a few warm-up questions.
- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? [Determine if they're a Veteran, family member, or a personal representative]
- Did you know that you could apply to see if you're eligible to be buried in a national cemetery at any time?
       - If so, how did you find out?
- What do you think qualifies you to be buried in a national cemetery?
- When thinking about planning for your burial, would you prefer to be buried in a national cemetery?
- Have you applied before to see if you're eligible for burial in a national cemetery? 
    - If Yes: Could you describe how that process went and your thoughts about it?
    - If No: Is that something you would be interested in doing at some point?

## Getting started - 1 minute

- When applying to see if you're eligible for burial in a VA national cemetery, the VA Pre-Need application can be used. I'm going to give you a couple of scenarios for you to walk through a prototype of this application and give us your thoughts.
- This prototype is a work in progress, so there might be a few mistakes, or it may not function exactly the way you expect, which is ok. Some areas will be clickable and some will not.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve the form to better meet Veteran's needs. We won't be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- Please talk aloud while you look through the form. For example, you could say "now I would click on this, because I think this will happen..." This helps us understand what's going through your mind while using the form.

## Scenarion 1: Veteran - Applying for Self - 5 minutes

-Ok, in the prototype we're looking at the Pre-Need application. For our first scenario, pretend that you are Sammy Smith, a Navy Veteran, and that you want t go ahead and talk me through what you would do upon arriving at this page. 






Can you explain what you are seeing now? 

Do you understand how to answer all of the questions this screen asks?

Are you prepared to answer these questions?

Is anything confusing or concerning to you?




## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

> [In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
