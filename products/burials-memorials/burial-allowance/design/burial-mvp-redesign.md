# Burial benefits 21P-530EZ flows & designs

Designer: [Fiorella](https://github.com/fiorella-io)

## Problem
After interviewing Pension and Burial SMEs we learned that both 527 Pension and 530 Burial forms are so outdated that after anyone submits those digital forms online, they get a letter in the mail telling them that they need to start a new application by paper. 

## Solution
To solve this we decided to 1) deactivate both forms as soon as possible. [You'll be able to read more about our deactivation plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/design/pension-burial-deactivation.md). And 2) Identify the missing fields and redesign the forms to include those fields as an MVP. 

There were some concerns from our stakeholders about deactivating the Burial benefits form so it was decided to not deactivate the Burial benefits form and to quickly redesign it. 

## Flows
We created a full [flow of the existing burial benefits form](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1691512530884/67e3bc6677c8d17cf6fc8848319a6e40ebced1af?wid=0-1691603080134), and simplified flows of both the [existing](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1691512530884/67e3bc6677c8d17cf6fc8848319a6e40ebced1af?wid=0-1691605354523) and [future state](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1691512530884/67e3bc6677c8d17cf6fc8848319a6e40ebced1af?wid=0-1694615398728) of the burial benefits form.
