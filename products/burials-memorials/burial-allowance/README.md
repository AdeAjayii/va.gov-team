## Overview
In 2023, it was discovered that the online 21P-530 form was several versions behind it's paper counterpart. Because of this, the online form was missing key fields needed for efficient and effective claim processing. A project was undertaken to quickly add all missing fields, remove obsolete fields, and address any critical accessibilty issues.

## Problem Statement
All online applications for burial benefits (530EZ) forms require additional development because required information is missing. This missing information causes delays in claim processing, places undo burden on applicants, and ultimately delays the receipt of benefits. Individuals submitting this form are often family members of deceased Veterans, caretakers of deceased Veterans, VSOs, social workers, funeral homes. By updating the online form to align with the most recent paper version, the number of online claims requiring development will be reduced and benefits will be received faster.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Online 530EZ claims are as complete as possible and require little to no development
- Applicants receive benefits faster
- The updated online form is easier to use
- The updated online form is quicker to use

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Online application are missing information required for efficient processing
- Users find the updated online form hard to use

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Online 530EZ applications require less resources to process than they currently do
- Online 530EZ applications are easier to process than paper applications

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Online 530EZ applications require the same or more resources to process than they currently do
- Online 530EZ applications are harder to process than paper applications
