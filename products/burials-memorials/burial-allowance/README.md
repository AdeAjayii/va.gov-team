*Iterating on a product? Have a new feature? Check out the [Initiative Brief Template.](https://bit.ly/initiative-brief-template)*

The online burial 530EZ form and the pension 527EZ form were developed and released together. See [this readme](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/pension/2019%20files/README.md).

VA Form 21P-530 (Application for Burial Benefits) enables eligible individuals to apply for compensation to help cover burial, funeral, and transportation costs.

---

## Overview
In 2023, it was discovered that the online 21P-530 form was several versions behind its paper counterpart. Because of this, the online form was missing key fields needed for efficient and effective claim processing. A project was undertaken to quickly add all missing fields, remove obsolete fields, and address any critical accessibilty issues.

## Problem Statement
All online applications for burial benefits (530EZ) forms require additional development because required information is missing. This missing information causes delays in claim processing, places undo burden on applicants, and ultimately delays the receipt of benefits. Individuals submitting this form are often family members of deceased Veterans, caretakers of deceased Veterans, VSOs, social workers, funeral homes. By updating the online form to align with the most recent paper version, the number of online claims requiring development will be reduced and benefits will be received faster.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Online 530EZ claims are as complete as possible and require little to no development
- Applicants receive benefits faster
- The updated online form is easier to use
- The updated online form is quicker to use

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Online application are missing information required for efficient processing
- Users find the updated online form hard to use

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Online 530EZ applications require less resources to process than they currently do
- Online 530EZ applications are easier to process than paper applications

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Online 530EZ applications require the same or more resources to process than they currently do
- Online 530EZ applications are harder to process than paper applications

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| KPI                              | Category           | Baseline | Goal   |
|----------------------------------|--------------------|----------|--------|
| % of claims requiring development| Service Completion | 100%     | 20%    |
| KPI                              | Ease of Use        |          |        |
| KPI                              | Trust/Satisfaction |          |        |
| % of submission failures         | Form Health        | ?        | <1%    |

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
   - An MVP of the updated form will be released that includes missing fields, removes obsolete fields, and addresses critical accessibility issues. By adding the missing fields to the online form, we can rememdiate many of the issues causing additional claim development and delays in benefits. 
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
   - This approach allows us to release quicky and reduce the burden placed on applicants to supply missing information after their online claim has been submitted. A comprehensive review and accessibility audit of the form would have added several months to the release plan.
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
   - We will not be addressing level 2-5 accessibilitiy issues or updating design components on pages that will not be touched as part of MVP. Narrowing the scope to pages that required critical updates allows us to release quickly. 
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
   - Post-MVP, we will requeest a comprehensive accessibility audit of the 530EZ online form and work to replace outdated design system components on pages that were not touched as part of MVP.
