## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
Funeral Homes, Veterans, family members, and personal representatives lack a way to initiate a request for burial of a deceased person through VA.gov to get their case started with the National Cemetery Scheduling Office (NCSO). Currently they need to call the NCSO in order to receive this benefit.  As a result it can extend Funeral Home processing times as well as make the process lengthier and more difficult for Veterans, family members, and personal representatives in their time of grief. 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
  - Funeral Homes can submit requests more effectively and efficiently; in turn providing better service to their clients in a difficult time.
  - Veterans, family members, and personal representatives, in their time of grief,  can have an easy, stress-free, and user-friendly to request a burial in their time of need by applying on VA.gov, thereby ensuring that they can bury their loved ones and receive their benefits in a timely manner.

- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
    - Funeral Homes no longer have to call the NCSO to get interment requests submitted, saving time and in turn money.
    - Funeral Homes, Veterans, family members, and personal representatives will be able to easily access their interment request status for ToN cases submitted, without having to reach out to the NCSO.
    - Veterans, family members, and personal representatives will be able to submit interment requests on their own time (24-7) and have a less emotionally draining experience, answering potentially sensitive questions over the phone, in their time of grief.
