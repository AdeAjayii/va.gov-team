# Document purpose

To document the nuances of plain and compassionate language that our content leads use so that other writers and designers can easily follow these patterns.

## General guide for writers

Ask questions for each piece of content you write:
- Who will read this page?
- What problem brought them to this content?
- What related challenges or stresses might they be dealing with? For example, someone looking for information about a health condition might be waiting for results or have been recently diagnosed. Someone looking to plan a burial has just lost a loved one.
- What questions might they have? You can use SEO research and/or Google's "people also ask" component to get started with this.
- How do we balance helping the user solve their specific problem as quickly and easily as possible, while still giving the user all the information they need to make informed actions and learn more if they want to go deeper?

## Language to avoid

### Language that uses words that imply abilities

- "View our factsheet (PDF)" > "Download our factsheet (PDF)"
- "View your benefit status" > "Check your benefit status" or "Review your benefit status"
- "See if you're eligible" > "Find out if you're eligible"
- "Watch this video" > "Play this video" ?
- "If you've heard VA has reopened facilities" > "If you've learned that VA has opened facilities"
- "Walk-in care" > "Same-day care" - needs confirmation from health care folks
- "Walk to the entrance" > "Go to the entrance"
- "The email you see here" or "The information you see here" > "This email" or "The information to follow"
-  Links that read "this page" after a descriptive sentence or two "For more information about this benefit, visit [this page] > Update this link to more a descrptive label or to the title of the page we're linking to. 

- **NOTE:** There are one more tools that are either already existing or far into design that use the word "View." Likely isn't practical at this time to try to change these.

### Language that implies one definitive way of how the user will interact with the site

Ex. A user may not be able to "press" 1 for an extension.

- "Call this number and press 1" > "Call this number and select 1"

-  Choose vs. select > Use "select" when asking users to pick an item from a list or a set of options. Use choose when making a decision on 1 thing. 

### Language that implies placement/direction on screen

- "The information to the left" (also doesn't take into account mobile responsiveness)

**Question:** Forms and eligibility - "the below" - would this make sense to a screen reader?

### Idioms

I know we do this in general, though I recently caught a random "Hang in there" on an old page and we removed it. But do we explictly say no idioms in style guide? If no, we need to add.

## Language nuances

### Genuine empathy, not overly friendly, casual, excited, marketing-focused, or excessively formal

These are important distinctions that we should continue to work to clarify.

### Softening language with subtle changes

- "You need to" > "You'll need to"
- "That depends." or "It depends." > "This depends on..."

### Person-first language

Already in style guide at: https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/health-content. However, this is an ever-evolving area, with some people preferring identity-first language, especially when they live with a condition that is lifelong and a key part of defining how they move through the world. 

Examples from reading:
 - Many in the Autism community have expressed preferring “Autistic person” or “Autistic individual” over “person with Autism.”
 - Many in the deaf and blind communities have expressed a greater preference for identity-first language as an expression of empowerment.
 - Some people prefer “disabled person” over “person with disabilities.” 

General consensus appears to be that person-first language is good, but we should be continuing to review and checking with people within the communities.

### Conditional first

We follow this as a content principle, but I don't know that it actually made it into the first iteration of the style guide. It should be in there.

Put conditional information first—so readers can quickly decide if information is relevant for them.
Ex. “You may qualify for extra benefits if you have dependents.” Becomes “If you have dependents, you may qualify for extra benefits.”

### Contextual links and buttons

"Learn more" > "Learn more about X"
"Visit the website" > "Visit the CDC website"

### Page titles and H1s

H1
_<_ 52 characters and should clearly describe what the page is about, while incorporating the primary keyword

Page title
H1 + VA.gov

### Consistent language

Use the simplest words describe something. Then, stick with that. Don't go back and forth to mix things up. If the page feels too repetitive because you're using the same term or phrase over and over, try to find ways to rework the content so you don't have to keep using that phrase rather than coming up with variations on the term or phrase itself.
