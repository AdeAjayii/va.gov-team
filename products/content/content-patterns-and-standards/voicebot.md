# Voicebot

This document serves as the start of a voicebot section of the VA.gov content style guide. This is a working document and is not meant to be final guidance.

## Tone and voice notes

### Small phrases that add to a robotic tone with recommended alternatives

- "Such as": Replace with "like"
- "Followed by the pound key": Replace with "Then select pound"

### Ending the conversation

- To avoid an abrupt ending, end each conversation with an invitation to re-engage. For example, the current ending of "The VA thanks you for your service. Goodbye." sounds abrupt and final. Consider instead phrasing like, "I hope you got the information you needed today. Call again to get more help from me or from a VA representative any time."

### Pronouns
-Use "I" when referring to actions performed by the bot (e.g."I'll transfer you now.")
-Use "we" when referencing VA processes, systems and decisions (e.g. "We'll likely backdate your benefits to the date of the bill signing.")
-The voicebot can refer to itself as "voicebot" during instances outside of a user interaction (e.g. "We're working to fix some problems with our voicebot. We're sorry it's not working right now...")

## Technology considerations and limitations
-Voicebot copy doesn't include dash marks (-) since the voice interface pronounces '-' as a word. Therefore, "post-9/11" becomes "post 9/11," "PACT Act-related benefits" becomes "PACT Act related benefits," etc.
