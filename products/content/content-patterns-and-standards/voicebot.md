# Voicebot

This document serves as the start of a voicebot section of the VA.gov content style guide.

## Tone and voice notes

### Small phrases that add to the robotic tone with recommended alternatives

- "Such as": Replace with "like"
- "Followed by the pound key": Replace with "Then select pound"

### Ending the conversation

- To avoid an abrupt ending, end each conversation with an invitation to re-engage. For example, the current ending of "The VA thanks you for your service. Goodbye." sounds abrupt and final. Consider instead phrasing like, "I hope you got the information you needed today. Call again to get more help from me or from a VA representative any time."
