# Content governance

## Resources and Support

*Note: "We" below refers to the collective VA, not to OCTO specifically.*

### Content planning
- How do we work with business lines to migrate legacy content to the modernized experience across benefit hubs and R&S? Where do we lead migration (such as we debt management) vs. business lines? 
- How do we make sure that we're adding articles strategically and not just creating volume? 
- How do we determine if a topic needs a new article vs. additions/updates to an existing article?
- How do we avoid duplicative/slight variations on content?
- How do we determine if a topic should be addressed at a specific program/benefit level or at a broader level?
- How do we make sure we keep our SEO effective and avoid keyword cannabilization?
- How do we make sure that content stays timely and relevant?

### Content design and display
- How do we make sure we're using the best template for a specific article? Do we want any enforcement around template type, or simply offer guidance? Are there any new templates or template changes we want to offer? 
  - Some notes from experience to date: Using an "About" template is simpler than using a multiple FAQ template (no need to create a bunch of single Q&As, no character limits within those Q&As), so people may naturally tend toward the "About" template. However, that limits the reusability of content since right now, the only reusable element is the single Q&A. It also limits the ability to enforce quality via rigid templates.
  - In general, FAQs sections aren't best practice from a usability standpoint. Yet, R&S encourages them. Would like to do more research into this before we get too far down the road of FAQs.
  - How do we want to use "How to" step-by-step articles? In general, the online forms and tools we build shouldn't need how-to articles because they should be easy to use. For some legacy processes (like travel pay), they're needed because the process is complicated. How 
- How does a content contributor determine whether there is existing content they can reuse (for example: how do they find single Q&As to add; right now, those are not easy to find from the long list of Q&As)?
- Once we open up R&S to content beyond Veteran-specific needs (i.e. content for school administrators, health care providers, etc.), how do we make sure that Veterans are still getting search results meant for them and not other audiences?
- How does a content author know which SEO keyword (if any) to focus on for an article?

### Quality assurance
- How do we make sure that content meets VA.gov standards for plain language and accessibility?
- How do we make sure that content that needs to be translated meets translation-ready standards?
- How do we balance content author automony and overall content production sustainability with quality standards?

## Proposed solutions

1. Solidify strategy for what content specifically belongs in R&S and clearly document this as well as for the R&S planning group.

2. Create a Resources & Support content planning group that consists of representatives from the OCTO content team + each business line (i.e., health, disability, education, careers, life insurance, pension, burials and memorials). Group's responsibilities include:
  - Maintaining a log of all R&S content 
  - Identifying critical legacy content for migration that OCTO + business line SMEs should partner closely on, and establishing a timeline for migration
  - 

2. Establish a content QA process that uses the content checklist to make sure all R&S content adheres to critical content standards.
 meeting weekly to review article requests and in-progress articles
  - We aren't creating duplicative/slight variations of the same topic
  - When we need to update existing content rather than create new content
  - Articles are optimized for SEO and we avoid keyword cannabilization
 
We could pilot this with 1 or 2 groups (such as VHA digital media).
