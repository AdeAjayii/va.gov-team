# Content governance

## Resources and Support

- Who makes the decision of what articles get added? Can any content contributor make that decision, or is there a reviewingp/planning group that confirms an article can be created?
- How do we make sure articles aren't duplicative/slight variations of the same topic?
- How do we ensure SEO optimization and avoid keyword cannabilization? Does the review/planning group manage that?
- How does a content contributor determine whether there is existing content they can reuse (for example: how do they find single Q&As to add)?
- Once we open up content to content beyond Veteran-specific needs (i.e. content for school administrators, health care providers, etc.), how do we make sure that Veterans are still getting search results meant for them and not other audiences?
