## Audience

### Beneficiaries
*Allow multiple choices, but add governance guidelines. Remove the more granular audiences for now to avoid confusion or too restrictive choices as we bring in non-OCTO authors and consider if we want to add those back in later.*
- Veterans
- Service members
- Family members

### Non-beneficiaries (leave as is for now)

## Benefit
*Allow multiple choices, but add governance guidelines. Explore value of keeping primary benefit. Explore not requiring a benefit (for example, you don't need a benefit for VA.gov support or VA profile).*
- Health care    
- Disability compensation
- Education and training
- Careers and employment
- Pension
- Housing assistance
- Life insurance
- Burials and memorials

## Other TBD bucket(s)

- Decision reviews
- Records
- VA profile
- VA.gov support
- Caregiver program (does this go up in Benefit?)
- Dependency and indemnity compensation (would people find this in the current benefit categories?)

## Topics

*We need criteria for what makes something qualify for a topic tag. For example, we could define based on these types of criteria:
  - Volume of individual R&S pages on a specific broader topic *(i.e., if more than X articles on one topic, create topic tag)*
  - Contact center inquiries on a specific broader topic 
  - Search queries on a specific broader topic

### Current topics
- Claims and appeals status
- Guide and service dogs
- Payments and debt
- Sign-in 

### Potential topics to add
