# VA.gov core benefit and service content audits

## Overview

By law, VA must audit all VA.gov content each year. The primary requirement of this audit is to make sure that VA.gov content remains timely, accurate, and available to Veterans and other beneficiaries. The Office of the CTO's VA.gov content, accessibility, and information architecture team also uses this opportunity to audit content against current standards to ensure that all content is easy for all Veterans and beneficiaries to find, understand, and use to do the tasks and make the right decisions they need to to fully access and manage their VA benefits.

## Products impacted

### Products covered in this audit

- **VA.gov core benefit and service content:** This content includes all static (or "unauthenticated") content within the VA.gov benefit hubs and resources and support section of VA.gov.

### Products not covered in this audit  

- **Dyanmic content:** At this time, audits of content within applications and tools and content behind sign-in (or "authenticated") content occur through separate processes in coordination with product teams.
- **Local VA.gov content:** This audit does not include any local content, such as content within VA medical center websites.
- **Other content:** This audit does not include any content within any legacy TeamSite pages, customized program office sites, or any WordPress sites (such as news.va.gov or departments.va.gov).

## Desired outcomes

This audit has 4 primary outcomes:

- Ensure timeliness and accuracy of core VA.gov benefit and service content
- Ensure that core VA.gov benefit and service content meets critical current standards for content, accessibility, and information architecture
- Ensure that VA partner offices have the opportunity to identify upcoming changes that may impact core VA.gov benefit and service content in the upcoming year to feed into the broader proactive content planning calendar
- Provide VA partners with a record of annual audits for compliance purposes
  
**Note:** This audit is not meant to lead to major changes in the structure or content of VA.gov. Major initiatives are separate. This audit is purely focused on accuracy and quality of existing content.
