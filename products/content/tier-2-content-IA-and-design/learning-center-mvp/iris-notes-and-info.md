## IRIS notes and info

This readme is to contain ad hoc and formal learnings about IRIS and IRIS issues as they relate to the Learnin Center product MVP. 


__IRIS is a CRM__

- IRIS URL: https://iris.custhelp.va.gov/ 
- ETA to retire end of Dec 2020. (This timeframe is not solid.)
- IRIS is where call center authors create and publish public facing support articles. (ex: IRIS FAQs)
- __IRIS is the ticketing system for the web form submissions.__
- This web form is used for both public customer inquiries and internal employee inquiries.


__IRIS vs. call centers__

- __IRIS is _not_ the CRM for actual customer phone inquiries!__
- There are multiple VA call centers; they each use a different/their own CRM for tracking/ticketing calls. 
- Assumption: Every call center has its own content team that creates/publishes articles in IRIS. 
- Assumption: VHA's call centers (collectively called "Member Services") _might_ share 1 content team for IRIS articles -- but might not.
- Currently, known CRMs used by different VA call centers use: MS Dynamics, Salesforce, and a custom CRM (VCL team)


__IRIS vs. Egaines__

- IRIS is used to publish external customer articles. 
- Egaines is the database and is where call center authors publish iternal "help aids" for call center reps -- like scripts.
