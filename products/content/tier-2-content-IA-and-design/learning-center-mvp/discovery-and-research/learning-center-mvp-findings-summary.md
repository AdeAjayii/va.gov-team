View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/usability-study-research-plan.md).

## Research Goals 

This study aimed to get feedback from Veterans on the Learning Center MVP concept in order to understand if the design supports the following goals:

1. Help Veterans find Tier 2 content in a way that doesn't dilute, distract, and clutter Veterans' benefit top task content and UX.

2. Increase self-service for Veterans, and those who support them, when they have questions about benefits or need to troubleshoot VA account problems.

3. Reduce calls to the call center and the need for in-person visits to VA locations to answer questions about benefits or to troubleshoot VA account problems.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted 45-60 minute sessions remotely using Zoom. Each session included a moderator and one participant, and started with a brief warm-up interview. Participants used InVision to review a [clickable prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4) that contained the Learning Center homepage, a few articles, a few search results pages, and a benefit hub page.

Participants were asked to review the content under 2 scenarios:

1. Imagine you had recently moved and had to make sure the VA had your new address. How would you do that?
2. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here (an unrelated Learning Center article page)?

### Who we talked to

We spoke to 8 Veterans

-   3 women, 5 men

-   2 participants age 35-44, 3 participants age 55-64, and 2 participants age 65-74. 1 participant did not disclose their age.

-   5 Caucasian, 2 African-American, and 1 participant self-identified as Other.

-   4 participants identified as having cognitive and/or functional disabilities.

-   All had at least one benefit and an account with a va.gov website (eBenefits, MHV, and/or VA.gov).


### Research Questions

- Is the information easy to find using this search-focused, tag-based navigation?
- How easily are people able to navigate between learning center articles, and topics?
- Are the template labels (ex: FAQs, Checklist, About, Step-by-step, etc.) useful?
- What do people see as the difference between the learning center search and overall site search?
- Do people get confused if they click on a content link or CTA button in the learning center and it takes them to a benefit hub page? And vice versa?
- Do people understand that information they don't find in the learning center might be in the benefit hub?
- Where would the most useful place be to provide links to the Learning Center?

## Details of Findings

### **The design of the learning center pages makes it easy to navigate and find information for most people.**

Generally, the design of the pages reviewed (homepage, topic results, and articles) made it easy for people to scan pages, find information, and understand any next steps. They used headings to scan pages, and then moved on to supporting text (e.g. article links under a topic section, or description under a search result) to get a deeper understanding of what they were looking at. 

Two participants thought the homepage was overwhelming and disorganized upon initial review of the homepage, but they were both quickly able to find information as we went through the session.

No one experienced any confusion when landing on a new page in an article; some people even stated the page exceeded their expectations. 

> "It's not quite what I expected - It's cleaner. I"m used to seeing a jumble of links that's hard to understand."

The h1 and intro text helped most participants understand the purpose of the learning center when they initially landed on the homepage, but they quickly scrolled past this section (including search) as the sessions went on. One person commented that the header and intro made it seem like they didn't go to the right place when landing on [Topics Tagged: Vietnam War Veterans](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/2SYENAW6VKT):

> First off, this thing at the top (*mouses over header and intro text*), you don't even need that. It doesn't even seem like it went where I need to be when I clicked.

**Implications**

- The layout and typography patterns in the current designs will help most Veterans easily search and find information. 

- We should evaluate whether or not the amount/presentation of links on the homepage is overwhelming in future studies, to determine if this is a larger trend.

- We should consider an alternative approach to the h1 and intro text, for two reasons:

  1. People skipping over the h1 and intro text on every page after the homepage suggests this information is redundant to them. 

  2. On smaller screens, that content will fill the viewport. Depending on scroll position and the React behavior, it has the potential to make people feel like nothing happened after they click on something.

### The categorization of information throughout the learning center pages reviewed makes sense.

People felt the way the information was categorized on the homepage made it easy to understand what is available in the learning center. When scanning the page, most people read links under the Articles by Audience, and then lingered in the Topics section the rest of the time on the page. 

> It [the layout] makes it very simple and easy for somebody to use, regardless of your age, or how you are associated with the military or the VA."

At various points in the session, we asked *"Show me how you would find..."*. Most people went to the topic area of the homepage and selected the correct benefit category. We know from the [brand consolidation research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation) that organizing information by benefit matches the Veteran mental model; it makes sense that they gravitated toward information organized by benefit topic, instead looking for information by audience. 

> I like the way that it's broken into different benefits - I think a lot of Veterans don't understand that.

Two people skipped over the `Find Articles by Audience` heading and went straight to the `You're a Veteran` heading. The word "You're" set the expectation for them that clicking the `Show More` button would reveal personalized options for them such as check their claim status, or updating their address. 

When reviewing a tag results page, participants understood that the content was scoped to that particular tag, and felt it was a helpful way to navigate the site.

> I think it's a very powerful, clean, and helpful presentation of the information.

6 of the 8 people didn't mention the topic and audience tags as something helpful in determining which article to choose on a search results page. The template labels on then results set an expectation of the article format, although there was uncertainty about what a few of them meant ([detailed below](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/learning-center-mvp-findings-summary.md#template-labels-were-helpful-for-most-people-when-reviewing-a-list-of-articles-but-there-was-ambiguity-about-what-some-labels-meant)).

**Implications**

- The topic and audience labels in the learning center make sense to our Veteran audience, and organizing information in this way will be helpful to those who browse links instead of performing a search.
- The participant's focus on Topics over Audience suggests that topics should be prioritized over audience on the homepage. However, this could be because the information we asked people to find was very much topic-oriented rather than audience-oriented. We should revisit this in future studies when we have a live environment that will encourage more natural behaviors.
- We should consider updating the copy around the Audience links, possibly by re-enforcing the word `articles` or removing the `You're...`, to minimize confusion that the content will be personalized to an individual Veteran. 

### Having to go through multiple resources to get answers to questions is frustrating to Veterans.

Many people expressed frustration at having to navigate multiple VA websites to get answers to questions about their benefits or VA.gov accounts (VA.gov, MHV, or eBenefits). 4 participants had to call someone to after struggling to find answers online.

> I just gave up at that point, and called the 1-800 number. I didn't want to keep bouncing [between sites].

> The way we perceive it is that the VA is trying to cause us to say "Screw it" that way they won't give us our benefits. They're intentionally trying to make it more difficult for us.

We included articles with similar or identical titles on the search results pages to see whether or not template labels would help people determine which articles were most relevant. While the labels did help 5 participants differentiate, 2 participants got frustrated and confused by the fact that there were two seemingly identical articles in the first place.

> That can be quite confusing, especially to folks that have TBI like me. That would be extremely confusing and very frustrating. You're sending us to more places than we need to go.

7 of 8 participants expressed a positive sentiment at the end of the session that they felt the learning center would be an improvement over what exists today, and that there would be a lot of value for Veterans in being able to find information through a searchable, streamlined approach.

> You know the term Rosetta Stone? I think this is strong enough, and organized well enough that it could be that for Veterans.

**Implications**

- The Learning Center concept is on the right track to improve Veteran self-service, and reduce the frustration they currently experience trying to track down information.
- Veterans will be frustrated by duplicative, conflicting, and irrelevant search results. We should implement guardrails to prevent duplicative and conflicting content in the learning center in order to build Veteran trust in the information we're providing them. This will streamline search results, and reduce the cognitive load required to determine which article actually answers their question.

### People had the perception that all benefit information would be available in the learning center, and did not get confused going to the benefit hub.

At multiple times during the session, participants were asked where they would find content that is classified as `Tier 1` by DSVA, such as a benefit application or benefit eligibility information. 7 of 8 participants said they would look in the Learning Center for this information, either by returning to the home page and browsing links by topic, or by searching with the `Search Learning Center` radio button selected.

When asked "How would you apply for a benefit you don't already have?" on a Learning Center article page, 4 of 8 participants expected to find the application via a `View all articles` link in a topic section, and 2 of the 8 participants would use search within the learning center. 

> I'd go back [to learning center home] or I could search the learning center again, and put in "disability benefits" and hit search. 

None of the participants experienced confusion, or noticed a change, when going between the benefit hub and learning center.

**Implications**

- Veterans do not differentiate between the two areas of the site. What matters most is getting their question answered.
- This study suggests that as long as we make it easy for Veterans to find what they're looking for, it won't matter if it lives in the learning center or benefit hub. However, because the tasks were so specific, this should be re-evaluated when we have a live product or more robust prototype that can more closely mirror a person's natural behavior when looking for information.

### 3 of 8 participants expected the audience and topic tags to be clickable.

Most people didn't comment on the audience and topics tags on the search results or article pages until they were prompted. Once they realized the tags were clickable, the results generally aligned with what they expected would happen. 

> It doesn't look like it's clickable. It just looks like this is the audience.

> "Are those viable links? What are you trying to get across with that? How are you trying to guide us?" 

2 participants expected the tags to behave as a layer on top of the Agent Orange content they were viewing.

**Implications**

- We should revisit the design of the tags to ensure they communicate interactivity.
- Layering tags to refine results may be useful to Veterans; we should explore this with both design and research for future iterations of the Learning Center.

### Template labels were helpful for most people when reviewing a list of articles, but there was ambiguity about what some labels meant.

7 of 8 participants noticed the template labels right away when reviewing the search result pages. The labels helped them understand there was a difference between similar sounding articles, and set an expectation for what they might find once they clicked. 

> Video, that's good for people that may not be able to sit and just read.

- `Step by Step` was clear to all participants.
- 3 participants were unsure about the difference between `Question and answer` vs `FAQs` .
- 1 participant wanted to be able to filter results by template labels so they could find only checklists and step-by-step articles

**Implications**

- Template labels are a helpful to Veterans looking at search results
- We should consider clarifying or combining `Question and answer` and `FAQs` .
- Filtering by template type to refine results may be useful to Veterans; we should consider exploring this in future versions of the Learning Center.

### People browsed links rather than use search.

We gave people 3 opportunities to find information throughout the session, and across all sessions, people returned to the learning center homepage `Articles by Topic` section almost every time. 5 of 8 people didn't mention the search functionality at all until prompted at the end of the session.

- 4 people were confident they'd find the information through the topics section if they could click. 
- 3 said they would first look under topics, and only use search if they didn't find what they were looking for there.

**Implications**

- The organization of the Articles by Topic section resonated with Veterans, and was perceived as a comprehensive source of information.
- People skipped over the h1 and intro text; it's possible that most ignored the search functionality because it got lumped into the content that remained static on every page.
- Because the tasks weren't search focused, and the prototype wasn't wired for search, the study didn't thoroughly evaluate the learning center search design. We should retest search functionality in a live environment or with a more robust prototype to more accurately evaluate people's search behaviors and expectations.

### People understood the search functionality, but the various search options caused confusion for some.

The search function [in our prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/94YERLV2XHY) had two radio buttons above the input: `Search learning center` and `Search VA.gov `. The `Search Learning Center` input was selected. The input was not clickable and people had to talk through what they would do to provide feedback.

Everyone understood that the search functionality was keyword based, and expected the `search learning center` radio option would search within the learning center. 

There was less clarity on what would happen if you changed the radio option to `search VA.gov` . 7 of 8 participants expected that it would conduct a broader search beyond the learning center content (like global site search), but the type of content returned in that broader search varied across participants. 

- 4 people's expectations aligned with the intended design. It is not clear whether or not they expected to be taken out of the learning center upon conducting the search.

- 3 people expected they could find **any** benefit related information with `Search learning center` selected.

  > I would expect the learning center to have more focused information on the actual condition or benefit. I wouldn't expect to find the [VA] Secretary's remarks to Congress in the learning center.

- 1 person was very confused by the two options. They struggled to articulate what they thought would happen, but eventually came to the correct conclusion.

**Implications**

- The `Search Learning Center` option is clear to people. `Search VA.gov` is less clear to people, and having both options requires more cognitive load for people to determine which is the right to use for their query.
- We should retest search functionality in a live environment or with a more robust prototype to more accurately evaluate the value of having two search options.

### Most people expect to find a link to the learning center prominently featured on VA.gov.

6 of 8 people said they'd expect to see something about the learning center prominently displayed on the homepage, or somewhere in the site header once it becomes available.

> Put it at the top of this page [mousing over header], because that's where people are going to look.

3 people said if they didn't see it on the homepage, and they knew what it was called, they would use site search to find it. 

**Implication**

Veterans would expect to find a link to a product link the learning center prominently displayed on the homepage or in the site wide header.

## Additional Insights

### **Multiple participants who identified as having cognitive or functional disabilities did not think the titles on the [Agent Orange hub page](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/FCYB790TDRM) were clickable**

The blue text wasn't sufficient enough to signify to them that the headings were interactive.

**Implication**

We should consider updating this pattern to make it more clear that the headings are interactive, or move the link to the description under the heading.

### 4 of 8 participants didn't think the name "Learning Center" felt right after reviewing the prototype.

Before seeing the prototype, participants had varied expectations about what would be contained in the learning center. 4 of 8 people said they thought it would be benefit-focused. Expectations from the other half ranged from educational content such as "how to use the VA website" to a personalized center where they could learn everything they had established with the VA (e.g. claim status and prescriptions).

After seeing the prototype, half of the participants felt strongly that the name wasn't appropriate. A participant with TBI and PTSD stated:

> The thing will be getting Veterans that deal with short term [memory loss] like I do. You need something that drives us *toward* the learning center, because I wouldn't automatically go there to find these answers. "Learning Center", we're thinking what kind of baloney is this? How's this going to answer my question?

Another participant who expected to find all benefit information in the learning center commented:

> "If I'm dealing with Agent Orange, and I come here - I don't need to **learn** about it. I live with it every day. I need to figure out how to file a claim"

**Implication**

- We should explore and test other names for this concept.
- We'll need to ensure we are clearly setting the expectations about the kind of information available in the learning center, either through the name of the center itself, or the contextual language driving people to it. 

### **Content-specific Feedback**

- People didn't immediately find the address information we asked them to find from the learning center homepage; about half of the participants went to their benefit topic area to update their address for that benefit.

- Language like "you **may** be eligible" is frustrating to some Veterans. 

  > "This is always a frustration for Vets [reads]: Depending on your type of benefit, you *may* be able to do this or that."

- Multiple Veterans were unsure about what calling 311 does; recommend adding more context around this on the website.

- Multiple Veterans expected to see information about the burn pit registry on the Exposure to chemicals and hazardous materials page.

- Multiple participants wanted to see information for a specific Veteran group. Specific groups, many related to Veterans in distress, that were individually mentioned in the sessions (but not by multiple people) are listed below. If a particular Veteran group doesn't seem themselves listed in a long list of audiences, they may feel frustrated, angry, or confused as to why they're left out.

  - Suicide information for Veterans at risk, and family members who thought a Veteran in their family may be at risk

    > "If you are experiencing depression or something, that should be a top link."

  - Resources for homeless Veterans

  - Help for Veterans who are overseas

  - PTSD assistance

  - Veterans who use service animals

 

## Next Steps

### Future Research Studies

- Evaluating search and navigability was limited in this study since we were evaluating a prototype and had to pose specific scenarios that people may not go through naturally, on their own. Once we have the learning center available in a live environment, we should:
  - Re-evaluate the ease of navigating between the learning center and benefit hub, and 
  - Include tasks that encourage users to use the Learning Center search functionality so we can confirm that it is easy to use, and more accurately evaluate how they understand the difference between LC search and site search.
- We weren't able to recruit participants under 34 for this study. To get a better understanding of the needs of younger Veterans, future studies should include the full spectrum of ages in our participant pool.
- To ensure we are meeting the needs of Veterans using non-laptop or desktop devices, we should test mobile versions of our designs. Once we have a product on staging (since prototyping tools are typically not great for testing with assistive tech), we should ensure to include users using assistive technology in research studies.
