## Research Goals 

This study aimed to get feedback from Veterans on the Learning Center MVP concept in order to understand if the design supports the following goals:

1. Help Veterans find Tier 2 content in a way that doesn't dilute, distract, and clutter Veterans' benefit top task content and UX.

2. Increase self-service for Veterans, and those who support them, when they have questions about benefits or need to troubleshoot VA account problems.

3. Reduce calls to the call center and the need for in-person visits to VA locations to answer questions about benefits or to troubleshoot VA account problems.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted these 1:1 sessions remotely using Zoom. Participants reviewed a clickable prototype using InVision. Sessions were between 45-60 minutes.

### Who we talked to

We spoke to 8 Veterans

-   3 women, 5 men

-   2 participants age 35-44, 3 participants age 55-64, and 2 participants age 65-74. 1 participant did not disclose their age.

-   5 Caucasian, 2 African-American, and 1 participant self-identified as Other

-   3 participants identified as having cognitive and/or functional disabilities

-   All had at least one benefit and an account with a va.gov website (eBenefits, MHV, and/or VA.gov)

### Research Questions

- Is the information easy to find using this search-focused, tag-based navigation?
- How easily are people able to navigate between learning center articles, and topics?
- Are the template labels (ex: FAQs, Checklist, About, Step-by-step, etc.) useful?
- What do people see as the difference between the learning center search and overall site search?
- Do people get confused if they click on a content link or CTA button in the learning center and it takes them to a benefit hub page? And vice versa?
- Do people understand that information they don't find in the learning center might be in the benefit hub?
- Where would the most useful place be to provide links to the Learning Center?

## Key Findings

The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form". See an example of this section [on the Caregiver findings document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/usability-testing-jan2020/research-findings.md).

1. Finding one
2. Finding two
3. Finding three
4. Finding four
5. Finding five
6. Finding six
7. Finding seven


## Details of Findings

List details of each finding in top findings here, with supporting quotes when possible.

## Additional Insights

Any additional insights that aren't "top findings."

## Recommendations

#### Future Research Studies

- Evaluating search and navigability was limited in this study since we were evaluating a prototype and had to pose specific scenarios that people may not go through naturally, on their own.  Once we have the learning center available in a live environment, we should:
  - Re-evaluate the ease of navigating between the learning center and benefit hub, and 
  - Include tasks that encourage users to use the Learning Center search functionality so we can confirm that it is easy to use, and more accurately evaluate how they understand the difference between LC search and site search.
- We weren't able to recruit participants under 34 for this study. To get a better understanding the needs of younger Veterans, future studies should include the full spectrum of ages in our participant pool.
- To ensure we are meeting the needs of Veterans using non-laptop or desktop devices, we should test mobile versions of our designs. Once we have a product on staging (since prototyping tools are typically not great for testing with assistive tech), we should ensure to include users using assistive technology in research studies.
