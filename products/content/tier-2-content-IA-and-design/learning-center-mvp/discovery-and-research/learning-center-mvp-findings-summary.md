## Research Goals 

This study aimed to get feedback from Veterans on the Learning Center MVP concept in order to understand if the design supports the following goals:

1. Help Veterans find Tier 2 content in a way that doesn't dilute, distract, and clutter Veterans' benefit top task content and UX.

2. Increase self-service for Veterans, and those who support them, when they have questions about benefits or need to troubleshoot VA account problems.

3. Reduce calls to the call center and the need for in-person visits to VA locations to answer questions about benefits or to troubleshoot VA account problems.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted 45-60 minute sessions remotely using Zoom. Each session included a moderator and one participant, and started with a brief warm-up interview.  Participants then used InVision to review a [clickable prototype](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4) that contained the Learning Center homepage, a few articles, a few search results pages, and a benefit hub page.

Participants were asked to review the content under 2 scenarios:

1. Imagine you had recently moved and had to make sure the VA had your new address. How would you do that?
2. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here (an unrelated Learning Center article page)?

### Who we talked to

We spoke to 8 Veterans

-   3 women, 5 men

-   2 participants age 35-44, 3 participants age 55-64, and 2 participants age 65-74. 1 participant did not disclose their age.

-   5 Caucasian, 2 African-American, and 1 participant self-identified as Other

-   4 participants identified as having cognitive and/or functional disabilities

-   All had at least one benefit and an account with a va.gov website (eBenefits, MHV, and/or VA.gov)


### Research Questions

- Is the information easy to find using this search-focused, tag-based navigation?
- How easily are people able to navigate between learning center articles, and topics?
- Are the template labels (ex: FAQs, Checklist, About, Step-by-step, etc.) useful?
- What do people see as the difference between the learning center search and overall site search?
- Do people get confused if they click on a content link or CTA button in the learning center and it takes them to a benefit hub page? And vice versa?
- Do people understand that information they don't find in the learning center might be in the benefit hub?
- Where would the most useful place be to provide links to the Learning Center?

## Key Findings

The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form". See an example of this section [on the Caregiver findings document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/usability-testing-jan2020/research-findings.md).

## Details of Findings

1. **Most people were easily able to navigate and find information in the learning center.**

   Clicking links between articles and finding their way back to the learning center homepage didn't pose a problem for participants.

   Template labels on each search result helped people differentiate between similar sounding articles and choose the one they thought would be most useful. When commenting on the search results, one participant wanted to be able to view results by the template type through a secondary filtering mechanism at the top of the search results.

   One person with TBI and short-term memory loss was very frustrated with the amount of pages and content they had to go through to complete the tasks presented

2. **The organization of information throughout the learning center pages reviewed made sense to most people.**

   People felt the way the homepage was organized made it easy to understand what kinds of information was available in the learning center. When scanning the page, most people read and understood the links under the Audience section, but then heavily focused on content available under topics throughout the rest of the session.  This suggests that Veterans approach content on the VA more from a benefit or topic mental model, rather than looking for content targeted to a specific audience.

   >  I like the way that it's broken into different benefits - I think a lot of Veterans don't understand that. 

   When reviewing a tag results page, participants understood that the content was scoped to that particular tag, and felt it was a helpful way to navigate the site.

   > I think it's a very powerful, clean, and helpful presentation of the information.

   - People found the topics and audience organization of information on the homepage helpful and easy to understand. 
   - People understood  how the tags applied to articles.

3. **People expected to find  Tier 1 content in the Learning Center.**

   At multiple times during the session, participants were asked where they would find content that is classified as `Tier 1` by DSVA. All participants said they would look in the learning center for this information, either by returning to the home page and browsing links by topic, or by searching the learning center.

   When asked `How would you apply for a benefit you don't already have?` while on an LC article page, one participant responded:

   > I'd go back [to learning center home] or I could search the learning center again, and put in "disability benefits" and hit search. 

4. **Only half of the people thought the audience and topic tags were clickable; some expected them to apply a second layer of filtering on top of what they were already looking at.**

   Once people realized the tags were clickable, they stated the format of the results were what they expected. Some participants expected the tags to behave has a layer on top of whatever content they were already looking it (and didn't realize the Vietnam War Veterans page was about more than Agent Orange)

   > It doesn't look like it's clickable. It just looks like this is the audience.

5. **Template labels were helpful for most people when reviewing a list of articles; there was ambiguity about what some labels meant.**

   Template labels helped most participants determine differences between similar sounding articles and set expectation for what they might find once they clicked. 

   - `Question and answer` vs `FAQs` posed some challenges for participants
     - 1 participant was totally unsure what the difference would be.
     - Participant 13 said "Question and answer is where people have asked a question and received an answer, and the other is just a list of facts (or FAQs?)" 
   - 1 participant thought the `About` tag was useless.

6. **Generally people understood the search functionality, but the various search options caused confusion for some. **

   The majority of people understood learning center search would focus the query in the learning center itself, and that overall site search was a broader, VA-wide search function. However, multiple people stated they thought the learning center content was related to benefits and benefit information, whereas overall site search would be more high-level `about the VA` content.

   

   Everyone understood that the search functionality was keyword based and were clear that the Learning Center radio option would search within the learning center.  

   - About half of the participants were unsure about what the `search VA.gov` radio button would do.
   - People understood the difference between the Learning Center search and the search in the navigation.  There was some uncertainty between the difference between the radio button options, and expectations varied regarding the results `search VA.gov` would return.

7. **People did not differentiate between the learning center and benefit hub.**

   - No one got confused going between content in the learning center and benefit hub.
   - **Recommendation:** Because the tasks were so specific, this should be re-evaluated when we have a live product on staging, or with a significantly more robust prototype that can more closely mirror a person's natural behavior when looking for information.
   - People didn't differentiate between the learning center or benefit hub.  
   - When asked about where they would find hub information while in the learning center (e.g. applying for a benefit they don't have), most people said they would search, and expected to stay in the learning center.
   - Question from Mickin: Are veterans separating benefits from learning center or is that totally a construct of ours that isn't resonating with Veterans?
   - Mostly true. 
   - Nobody acknowledged a difference going between the benefit hub or learning center, and nobody got confused.
   - People said they would search to find what they were looking for, but the tasks in the study didn't allow us to conclusively evaluate how people will look for something if they can't find what they are looking for.  Because we had a limited amount of screens that didn't include keyword searching, people would talk through where they thought they'd found something, but we didn't take it a step further to evaluate what they would do when they realized they were wrong.

8. **Most people stated they called someone after not being able answer their benefit or account related question online.**

   

9. **People browsed links over using search**

   1 participant primarily would use search and felt overwhelmed by the links on the page.

   When asked how they'd apply for a benefit they don't already have while in the learning center **X participants** returned to the learning center home page and browsed the links in the Articles by Topic section.

   

10. **Most people stated they would expect to find a link to the learning center prominently featured on the homepage, or somewhere in the site header**.

    - The majority of the people said they'd expect to see something about the learning center prominently displayed on the homepage, or somewhere in the site header.
    - 1 person expected it to be promoted offline in order to learn of its existence.

## Additional Insights

**X of 8 participants thought the name "Learning Center" felt right for this concept.**

- Before seeing the prototype:

  - 2 people expected something called "Learning Center" to contain information related specifically to education, or that it would contain educational content such as ` how to use the VA website` or `using Microsoft word`
  - 1 person described the Learning Center to be something that was totally dedicated to them, where they could learn about their claim status, prescriptions, etc.

- Veteran Assistance, Information Center, and Vet Scope were alternative name suggestions. 

  We'll need to ensure we are clearly communicating the kind of information available in the learning center, either through the name of the center itself, or the contextual language driving people to it.  A participant with TBI and PTSD stated:

  > The thing will be getting veterans that deal with short term [memory loss] like I do. You need something that drives us *toward* the learning center, because I wouldn't automatically go there to find these answers. "Learning Center", we're thinking what kind of baloney is this? How's this going to answer my question?

**Multiple people were unsure how the article results pages were sorted.**

People weren't sure if they were alphabetic

**Content-specific Feedback**

- People didn't immediately find the address information we asked them to find from the learning center homepage; about half of the participants went to their benefit topic area to update their address for that benefit.

- Language like "you **may** be eligible" is frustrating to some Veterans. 

  > "This is always a frustration for Vets [reads]: Depending on your type of benefit, you *may* be able to do this or that."

- Multiple Veterans were unsure about what calling 311 does; recommend adding more context around this on the website.

- Multiple participants wanted to see information for a specific Veteran group.  Specific groups, many related to Veterans in distress, that were individually mentioned in the sessions (but not by multiple people) are listed below.  If a particular Veteran group doesn't seem themselves listed in a long list of audiences, they may feel frustrated, angry, or confused as to why they're left out.

  - Suicide information for Veterans at risk, and family members who thought a Veteran in their family may be at risk

    > "If you are experiencing depression or something, that should be a top link."

  - Resources for homeless Veterans

  - Help for Veterans who are overseas

  - PTSD assistance

  - Veterans who use service animals

**Some people weren't clear that the Learning Center was *part* of VA.gov, rather they talked about it as if it was the whole site.**

It seemed like many people had not visited the VA website and they were confused because they thought the learning center was a signed in experience of MHV or eBenefits.

**Multiple people expressed frustration with using site search on va.gov****

- Returns articles that send you away from the site to complete your task.

**2 of 8 Veterans understood the "You're a Veteran..." box to contain personal information specific to them**

- Expected the "show more" link to reveal actions they could take as a Veteran, such as check the status of a claim, viewing profile information, etc.

## Recommendations

#### Future Research Studies

- Evaluating search and navigability was limited in this study since we were evaluating a prototype and had to pose specific scenarios that people may not go through naturally, on their own.  Once we have the learning center available in a live environment, we should:
  - Re-evaluate the ease of navigating between the learning center and benefit hub, and 
  - Include tasks that encourage users to use the Learning Center search functionality so we can confirm that it is easy to use, and more accurately evaluate how they understand the difference between LC search and site search.
- We weren't able to recruit participants under 34 for this study. To get a better understanding the needs of younger Veterans, future studies should include the full spectrum of ages in our participant pool.
- To ensure we are meeting the needs of Veterans using non-laptop or desktop devices, we should test mobile versions of our designs. Once we have a product on staging (since prototyping tools are typically not great for testing with assistive tech), we should ensure to include users using assistive technology in research studies.
