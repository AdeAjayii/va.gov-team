# Research Plan for Learning Center MVP:  Card Sort

**---- DRAFT ----**

Liz Lantz, Public Websites, August 2020

## Goals

The goal of this study is to evaluate the nomenclature for the Learning Center audience and topic labels, and see how those labels are applied to articles by Veterans and VA content authors.

**Research questions**

- Does each audience/topic label make sense to participants? 
- How do participants assign the primary audience and topic labels to articles?
- Have we missed, or mis-labeled, any significant audiences or topics? 
- Do they understand the labels in expected or unexpected ways?

**Hypothesis**

- Veterans will understand what beneficiary labels mean and map them to the relevant article titles. 

- Veterans will understand what topic labels mean and map them to the relevant article titles. 

- VA content authors will understand both beneficiary and non-beneficiary audience labels and map them to the relevant article titles. 

- VA content authors will understand what topic labels mean and map them to the relevant article titles. 

  

## Method

We will be creating 2 hybrid, unmoderated studies using OptimalSort (links below):

1. One to evaluate topic labels
2. One to evaluate audience labels

Each study will contain article titles as the cards, and the labels as the categories. 

In order to keep data separate for our 2 participant groups, we'll duplicate each study to generate a link for Veteran participants, and a separate link for VA content author participants.

## Participants and Recruitment

We'd like to recruit 50 Veterans participants.

#### **Must have for participants**

Do you have an ID.me account, a My HealtheVet account, or a DS Logon account. Multiple accounts are fine? (pass = yes)

#### Good to have for participants

- 50/50 female and male participants
- At least 50% identify with a group other than Caucasian
- Diversity across all Veteran age groups in our participant pool
- Diversity across rural and major metropolitan areas
- Diversity across all education levels in our participant pool 
- At least 5 participants who have a disability rating of 70% or greater
- At least 5 participants who identify as having cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.

#### Recruitment requirements

This study requires participants to drag and drop elements.

#### **Recruitment strategy** 

- We will use the Perigean contract to recruit Veterans using [this email template.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort-recruit-email.md)
- We will work with our web contacts across VA business offices to recruit the appropriate VA content authors via email.

## When?

The link for the card sort will be shared out during the week of September 7, 2020. The card sorting exercise should take participants 10-20 minutes to complete.

The card sort link will be tested by a member of the Public Websites team prior to sending it out.

## Team Roles

Since this is an unmoderated study, there will be no team members present for the sessions. Plan and study created by Liz Lantz, liz.lantz@adhocteam.us
