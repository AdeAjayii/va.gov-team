# Learning Center user research

## Participant 13, 8/5/2020, 8am

**Intro…**
**I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about your benefits or VA account?**

> Yes. 

**What was that question about?**

> Last week or the week b4 I was trying to fig out how to sign up for VA benes to go back to school. Cd not find. 

**What was the first step you took to get that answered?**

> Had to ask someone who knows how to get education benes. 

> Yesterday tried to get an appt with dental. You have to call them. 

> For educ, you just have to click around and see if you can find something. Did not know which VA website to go to. Asked a friend who knew, and it had changed in the year since he signed up. 

**What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?**

> It’s not that it’s broken down poorly. “It’s up to you to figure it out.” 
>
> You have to go to lots of websites. For dental, it’s not on the list. There is no info. You have to find your nearest clinic and call them and set up a new patient exam. You can’t do any of it online. 

**That sounds frustrating.  Was that the last time you visited a VA website?**

> Sometimes I go to MHV. Getting appts there is no problem unless you are looking for dental. (See above ^ )

**If you saw a section of VA.gov called “Learning Center”, what kinds of things would you expect to see there?**

I would hope free online classes, education for job placement, like I need to learn how to use Microsoft or use a computer better, or typing tutorials, or anything like that.

**Imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. How would you do that?**

> I go to VA and update my BEIRS (?). I do it in person. 
>
> “I don’t know where to do it on the website.”

### **Task 1: General impression**

**Tell me what this page is for and what you can do.**

> Reading thru the 1st box on left: You’re a Vet… Wd hope to find change address, update bank acct. all of that stuff. 

**Moderator: So actions that you can take?**

Yeah, Actions where I cd update my info. I assume since I”m logging into a secure website; I should be able to do some of those things.” I could also pull up my expect to see my current disability %, should be able to contact my doctor, request an appointment, check lab results, “everything. “

*Looking at articles under the 2 top boxes on the LC homepage…*

> I can check claim status here, underneath.  (In VA account and profile information). Those are articles by topic, hmm.

*Participant mousing over audience boxes.*

In this box, it says You're a Veteran or receive VA Benefits, you would think that would be the main thing, you could update all hat information in. It says You're the veteran kind of things. And the rest of it, these are just articles, telling me how to do stuff.  Some of these I'd expect a hot link where I could actually go to the place and I can do it, instead of reading an article that's going to tell me to go to another place.

**You mentioned if you had signed in you'd expect to have access to do those things from here. If you had not already signed in, would that still be your expectation?**

I'd think if I clicked on it, it'd ask me to sign in. Either way, I have to sign in to do it. There should be an open dashboard kind of thing where people can do things, and if they want to do something before they sign in, it'll ask them to sign in first.

**Your impression of how this page is organized?**

This sounds terrible, but it looks like the regular VA page. And the VA page to some extent is disorganized. It goes into other things other things ppl don’t necessarily need immediately.

> He is pointing to upper right of page: If you are a Vet, click here. If you are working with Vets, click here. 

*Describes separating parts of the page by Veteran with benefits, w/out, and if you work with Vets*

### **Task 2: Find article on a specific topic**

**Take a look at this page (LC homepage) and tell me how you’d make sure VA has your new address. Think out loud.**

Well, I'd go to Find a VA location (in header), after I found my local VA, I'd contact them and ask where my local BEIRS office is, and ask them how to do it. Not every VA is the same.  

I would find my local VA. Have them update my info. “Every VA is not the same.” Not standardized. I have a service dog. That’s OK at my VA. but I have to call ahead to find out if another VA allows it. 

> “Every VA runs somewhat autonomously.” 

**For the purpose of this exercise, can you see if there is a way you'd do that without going to a location?**

*Scrolls, looks through different topic areas.*

Here’s Educ, that would've solved one thing. I don’t see an “enroll for healthcare with VA.” I'm looking. I’m not seeing a specific place I can go to to change my address.”

**OK, go to all account and profile articles.**

*Immediately starts scrolling* 

There it is. *points to Change your address for VA benefits link in search results*

**How does this  line up with what you expect?** 

I mean, it lines up pretty good. It has a bunch of stuff on it, but again, the most common, its one of those, separating it by... I'm a weirdo. I don't want to have to click 10 times for something that in my view should be one of the first things they ask about. Is your address up to data? Boom. If not, click here, Check your address. With most people that rent places to stay, it's usually an annual lease, you'd think that people chainng their address would be more important because not everybody buys a home. To make it hard for people to change their address, you end up getting people with stuff sent tot heir old address for a long time.

> I just got Vet life insurance notifications delivered to my parents’ “I  have not lived there for 10 years and I don’t know how to change it.” (his address on file with VA for life insurance)

**Go ahead and click on an article that you think would be helpful. Talk me through what you see**

*On How to chg address online page…scrolls and reads content *

> “This address should change for /everything/ related to the VA, and it doesn’t.”

> Last time I changed address, I was able to get someone on the phone to help me. I've been fairly lucky with some of the people I deal with at the VA.

> Yes,  this page would answer my question. 

**OK, what if you thought a different page would be more helpful? Show me how you'd get there.** 

> Clicked the back button in browser and went back to search results. 

> I think I just did this one (article). He actually clicked on a diff one this time:
> Change your address for VA benes. It says depending on your benefit, you might be able to change you address online. 

> “Why can’t it change for everything?” (my address)

> It doesn’t even list VGLI on this page. (life insurance)

> RE: life insurance… 
> Now I owe $52 a month for the past 6 years or they cancel my policy. I thought it was coming out of my pay. They don’t call you; they just send it in the mail. I only pick up my mail every 6 months from my parents. 

### Task 5: Navigating between topics, and between Hub and Learning Center

*Participant is on LC home page*

**We’re going to shift gears now. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?**

Probably right here, mousing over “Medical and public health professionals” link. In 2nd box at top of page (LC homepage). 

**What would you expect to find if you click on that?**

I would expect to find information for a health professional or someone else I'm trying to help. I work with disabled Veterans not at the VA but a different job, I'd hope to find some information with stuff that could help them.

*Moderator sends agent orange link*

**How does this line up w/what you expect?** 

*On the page that lists everything you could have been exposed to…*

What about the current thing everybody’s signing up now, the burn pit registry?

**I'm not sure if that's on a different page in the site, or if it needs to be added here.**

To me, I would think it would need to be here. It's a big thing that everyone is trying to get everybody to sign up for. We were all exposed to burn pits.

My dad, Agent Orange, that would work for him *points to heading*

*continues to read through items on page*

**Other than the missing burn pit info, how does this line up with your expectation coming from the previous page?**

Uh, it's got a lot of stuff. You know, you could add more.

**Okay, well go ahead and see if you can find the info about compensation for Veteran exposed to agent orange**

> I wd think it wd need to be here — “we were all exposed to burn pits.” 

> My dad - Agent Orange wd work for him.

> I work with disabled Vets. (Mentioned this earlier.)

> He’s going thru the different things on the Agent Orange exposure page. He is matching the exposure item to ppl he knows and talking about which wars go with which chemicals/health issues. “It’s got a lot of stuff. You cd add more.”

*How would you help the person exposed to Agent Orange?* 

> Right here. Clicked the Agent Orange link on the page. “This is more for the Veteran; it’s not for the provider.” 

> “It doesn’t really necessarily say what the provider needs to give the Vet to support their claim.”

> It has what kind of benefits you get; what evidence. “That’s good.”

> “Presumption”? What does that mean? 

> Pointing to an accordion: This should say: “What common cancers are associated with Agent Orange? “Taking the VA out of that statement will make ppl more likely to click it “ 

> “VA is my primary healthcare provider, but I don’t trust them. … That’s the way it is.”

> I wd check common cancers. Look for a contact. Also: Where were you? What is the evidence you need. Military records? (Checking all criteria needed for Agent Orange compensation.)
> Next step wd be to have the person gather all info and take it to svc officer at their local VA. 

> As he was checking criteria, he mentioned checking off the “list” ^. 

**Click on learn how to find a disability claim. Let’s say you didn’t know about going to a VSO or VA. How line up with your expectations?**

*Reads content on page under `What evidence will I need to provide my claim?` `Can I file my claim online`*

> Reading 3rd bullet about supporting statements. “That’s good, I guess. Yeah.”

> Reading thru the content: Can I file my claim online. ..You can file it by mail. I wd not do that (mail). Reading thru getting the help of a trained professional. This page should have links to VSOs, certified groups that can help you. VFW. American Legion. 

I think there should be more links to VSOs. The VA in and of itself has a fiduciary responsibility not to give away any money that they don't think they should, so they fight your claim. They have a responsibility to save money where they can, so they always make it as hard as they can to get your benefits. So having you go to someone who isn't related to the VA but is authorized to work with the VA, for you, on your behalf, and accredited through the VA to process claims, an outside VSO, in my opinion would be way better.

Those of us who use the VA, we already feel like the VA thinks of us as a number and they will just save money when we die. 

They're going to give us as little care as they have to, and then when we die they save money, so they're happy.

 **How find articles of interest to same group of readers?** 

> Right here. “On this page” links. (still on Agent Orange LC page)

**So you understand things in plus signs to be articles?** 

> I do. But I am 37 yrs old. Used computer most of my life. But my dad wd not go online. (Dad is a Vietnam Vet.)

### Task 6: Review tag results

*Still on Agent Orange LC page…* 
**Did you notice the audience and topic tags?**

I did.

**What would you expect to happen if you clicked on one?**

Well, I think for Vietnam Vets link (tag) wd give me broader list of things Vietnam Vets have dealt with, like shrapnel and the wounds that they've dealt with. 

I would assume it would have more stuff for Vietnam Vets, and benefits that would be targeted to them. 

*clicks tag*

**How does this line up with what you expected to happen?**

For sure, it lines up.

**And what do you think about how this information is organized?**

I mean, it's very similar to Google search the way it's laid out. Again, whether it’s helpful depends on your target audience, their age groups. How familiar they are with computers and electronics. 

**Notice any articles that cd be the same?** 

*scrolls*

These two. Blue Water Navy Veterans Law, and BMWV Act. 

**What are the differences?** 

> One is Q&A. One its FAQ.

These two are exactly the same, the FAQ and the video (*points to titles*).  1 is probably print, and 1 is videos. 

### Post-Task Interview

*From this screen, talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don’t already have - education, home loan, something like that.*

*On Vietnam Vet results page*

I would have to go back *uses back button* to actually this page 

*(LC Homepage), goes to topics section of page*

**Something else we haven't talked about yet, up at the top here. We haven't discussed search at all, it hasn't come up.**

*participant mouses over search in navigation* Right here?

**Yes, but there is also a search bar below. Had you noticed that?**

I have, but unless you've made some really serious changes to how the search bar typically works with the VA...I have used the search bar, and almost exclusively you’ll get articles telling you to go somewhere else to do what you're trying to do.

**Do you prefer to find links instead of search?** 

Yes, because normally it doesn't show me the link, it'll show me an article which opens up a new website, which means next time I view the article I have to log back in on a new page.

**What do you understand the differences to be between the two options?**

The learning center would just give you information, the search VA.gov would give you access to make a decision, application, or find a point of contact. Vs the LC gives you articles, and maybe a POC at the end of the article. But generally speaking, any of the contact information you find on here is a general number. Not to anyone specifically.

**How do you understand this search bar vs navigation?**

My understanding is they are basically the same.

**We don’t know what to call the product you reviewed yet. Now that you have a better idea of the type of information that’s here, what you think of the name Learning Center?**

I wd say ‘Information Center.’ Because, if I have Agent Orange exposure and I click on a search here, and you send me to an article, I already know what's going on with AO exposure. I'm not trying to learn more about that. I am trying to figure out how to get treatment for it. 

**Say you went to VA.gov today and knew we had launched this product. How would you find it on the website?**

I actually don't know. I'm assuming from home it would be under benes and healthcare. Or About VA. From the navigation. 

**Overall, what, if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this learning center concept as a whole?**

Valuable, yes. It seems like you have more info than the VA currently has, readily available. I don't know if your target demographic for some of this stuff, again with people being older, and younger people applying for benefits. You have both, and you'll have to have a happy medium. 

There should be an option to have something sent to your house, a print version. My parents have 3 computers and have no idea how to use them. It does them no good to have a website they don't know how to use. I could give print to my dad, he could fill out and earmark, give back to me, and we can find it online together.

**Anything else you think could be improved about what we’ve reviewed today?**

Yes, point of contact. If I am logged in and it has my address, my city. The contact number here (mousing over footer) should populate with the number for my local VA. 

*Also - The 800 number in the footer — he noticed the typo.* 

**Any questions for me?**

No, I guess I'm good. I appreciate the opportunity.

Oh, let me see. I saw burial benefits. “Is there a section that says how benefits work? Who’s entitled to what, where, and why?”
