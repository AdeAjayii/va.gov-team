8:00 am

*Intro…*
*I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about your benefits or VA account?*
> Yes. 

*What was that question about?*
> Last week or the week b4 I was trying to fig out how to sign up for VA benes to go back to school. Cd not find. 

*What was the first step you took to get that answered?*
> Had to ask someone who knows how to get education benes. 

> Yesterday tried to get an appt with dental. You have to call them. 

> For educ, you just have to click around and see if you can find something. Did not know which VA website to go to. Asked a friend who knew, and it had changed in the year since he signed up. 

*What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?*
> It’s not that it’s broken down poorly. “It’s up to you to figure it out.” 
> 
> You have to go to lots of websites. For dental, it’s not on the list. There is no info. You have to find your nearest clinic and call them. You can’t do any of it online. 

*Was that a typical experience for you?*
> Sometimes I go to MHV. Getting appts there is no problem unless you are looking for dental. (See above ^ )

*Prototype…*
   [https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4) 

*If you saw a section of VA.gov called “Learning Center”, what kinds of things would you expect to see there?*
> “LC” - wd have education for job placement, Microsoft,  how to use a computer,  typing tutorials. 

*Imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. How would you do that?*
> I go to VA and update my BEIRS (?). I do it in person. 
> 
> “I don’t know where to do it on the website.”

*Task 1: General impression*

*Tell me what this page is for and what you can do.*
> Reading thru the 1st box on left: You’re a Vet… Wd hope to find change address, update bank acct. Actions where I cd update my info. I assume I”m logging into a secure website; I should be able to do some of those things.”

> Expect to see my disability %, communicate with doctor, check lab results, “everything. “

Looking at articles under the 2 top boxes on the LC homepage…
> I can check claim status here, underneath. 

> I should be able to do everything through the “You’re a Vet” box. These are just articles below. I wd expect a hot link to take me to a place (pointing to “You’re a Vet” box) instead of reading an article to tell me how to do it (below). 

> “If I click on it, it should ask me to sign in.” I am more than willing to do that. Sign in before or after, it doesn’t matter. Like an open dashboard, and I can just sign in. 

*Your impression of how this page is organized?*
> Looks like the “regular VA page.” Lot of things. “It goes into other things ppl don’t necessarily need immediately.” 

> He is pointing to upper right of page: If you are a Vet, click here. If you are working with Vets, click here. 

> To change address: 
> I wd find my local VA. Have them update my info. “Every VA is not the same.” Not standardized. I have a service dog. That’s OK at my VA. but I have to call ahead to find out if another VA allows it. 

> “Every VA runs somewhat autonomously.” 


*Task 2: Find article on a specific topic*

*Take a look at this page (LC homepage) and tell me how you’d make sure VA has your new address. Think out loud.*
> Here’s Educ. I don’t see an “enroll for healthcare with VA.”

> “I’m not seeing  a specific place I can go to to change my address.”

*OK, go to all account and profile articles.*
> Clicked “all” link and went to search results page. “There it is.”

*How does this  line up with what you expect?* 
> Lines up pretty good. “I’m a weirdo. I don’t want to have to click 10 times.” 

> “You’d think that changing your address would be very important because not everyone buys a home.”

> I just got Vet life insurance notifications delivered to my parents’ “I  have not lived there for 10 years and I don’t know how to change it.” (his address on file with VA for life insurance)

> On How to chg address online page…
> “This address should change for /everything/ related to the VA, and it doesn’t.”

> Last time I changed address, I was able to get someone on the phone to help me. 

> Yes,  this page would answer my question. 

*OK, find a related article.* 
> Clicked the back link and went back to search results. 

> I think I just did this one (article). He actually clicked on a diff one this time:
> Change your address for VA benes. It says depending on your benefit, you might be able to change you address online. 

> “Why can’t it change for everything?” (my address)

> It doesn’t even list VGLI on this page. (life insurance)

> RE: life insurance… 
> Now I owe $52 a month for the past 6 years or they cancel my policy. I thought it was coming out of my pay. They don’t call you; they just send it in the mail. I only pick up my mail every 6 months from my parents. 


*Task 5: Navigating between topics, and between Hub and Learning Center*
	
/Participant should still be on Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQsor How to change your address online article. /

*We’re going to shift gears now. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?*
> “Medical and public health professionals” link. In 2nd box at top of page (LC homepage). I wd hope I cd find someone who cd help them. 

*How does this line up w/what you expect?* 
> He is on the page that lists everything you could have been exposed to…
> “What about the current thing everybody’s signing up now, the burn pit registry?”

> I wd think it wd need to be here — “we were all exposed to burn pits.” 

> My dad - Agent Orange wd work for him.

> I work with disabled Vets. (Mentioned this earlier.)

> He’s going thru the different things on the Agent Orange exposure page. He is matching the exposure item to ppl he knows and talking about which wars go with which chemicals/health issues. “It’s got a lot of stuff. You cd add more.”

*How would you help the person exposed to Agent Orange?* 
> Right here. Clicked the Agent Orange link on the page. “This is more for the Veteran; it’s not for the provider.” 

> “It doesn’t really necessarily say what the provider needs to give the Vet to support their claim.”

> It has what kind of benefits you get; what evidence. “That’s good.”

> “Presumption”? What does that mean? 

> Pointing to an accordion: This should say: “What common cancers are associated with Agent Orange? “Taking the VA out of that statement will make ppl more likely to click it “ 

> “VA is my primary healthcare provider, but I don’t trust them. … That’s the way it is.”

> I wd check common cancers. Look for a contact. Also: Where were you? What is the evidence you need. Military records? (Checking all criteria needed for Agent Orange compensation.)
> Next step wd be to have the person gather all info and take it to svc officer at their local VA. 

> As he was checking criteria, he mentioned checking off the “list” ^. 

*Click on learn how to find a disability claim. Let’s say you didn’t know about going to a VSO or VA. How line up with your expects?*
> Reading 3rd bullet about supporting statements. “That’s good, I guess. Yeah.”

> Reading thru the content: Can I file my claim online. ..You can file it by mail. I wd not do that (mail). Reading thru getting the help of a trained professional. This page should have links to VSOs, certified groups that can help you. VFW. American Legion. 

> VA has a fiduciary responsibility to not give out money. 

> “They always make it as hard as they can to get your benefits,” 

> “The VA thinks of us as a number and they will save money when we die.”

 *How find articles of interest to same group of readers?* 
> Right here. “On this page” links. (still on Agent Orange LC page)

*So you understand things in plus signs to be articles?* 
> I do. 

> I am 37 yrs old. Used computer most of my life. But my dad wd not go online. (Dad is a Vietnam Vet.)


*Task 6: Review tag results*

Still on Agent Orange LC page… 
*Did you notice the audience and topic tags?*
> Yes. 
> 
> Vietnam Vets link (tag) wd give me broader list of things Vietnam Vets have dealt with, like shrapnel. I wd assume it wd have more stuff for Vietnam Vets, and benes that wd be targeted to them. Yes, it lines up.

> Way it’s laid out is very similar to Google search. Whether it’s helpful depends on your target audience, whether they use computers. 

*Notice any articles that cd be the same?* 
> Blue Water Navy Vets. 

*What are the differences?* 
> One is Q&A. One its FAQ.

*These are exactly the same? What is the difference?* 
> 1 is print, the other is video. 

*Post-Task Interview *
*From this screen, talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don’t already have - education, home loan, something like that.*
> I wd have to go back. Went back to Agent Orange exposure, then hit back button again to go to LC home. Went to pension block. 

> I wd say “Are you 65?” Or “Is it time for your pension to start?”

> Again, depends on the person as to how helpful this page is. 

> Dad was in Vietnam. He is in his late 70s. He wd ask me, ‘What am I supposed to do with this?”

*From what you’ve seen today, can you describe how the learning center is different from overall site search?*
> “I have used the search bar, and almost exclusively you’ll get articles telling you to go somewhere else to do what you want to do.”

*Do you prefer to find links instead of search?* 
> Yes, bc the next time I wd have to click back in 

> LC wd just give you info and articles., maybe point of contact at end of article. VA. gov wd give you ability to apply. 

> Search bar at top — “my understanding is they are basically the same.” 

*We don’t know what to call the product you reviewed yet. Now that you have a better idea of the type of information that’s here, what you think of the name Learning Center?*
> “I wd say ‘Information Center.’ “ If I have Agent Orange exposure and you send me to an article, I already know I have it. I am trying to figure out how to get treatment for it. 

*Say you went to VA.gov today and knew we had launched this product. How would you find it on the website?*
> Which product? How find on VA.gov? I assume it wd be under benes and healthcare. Or About VA. From the navigation. 

*Overall, what, if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this learning center concept as a whole?*
> “Valuable, yes. It seems like you have more info than the VA has, readily available.” 

> “There should be an option to have something sent to your house, a print version.” My parents have 3 computers and have no idea how to use them. I cd give print to my dad, he could fill out and earmark, give back to me.  

*What do you think could be improved about what we’ve reviewed today?*
> Yes, point of contact. If I am logged in and it has my address, my city. The contact number here (mousing over footer) should populate with the number for my VA. 

> The 800 number in the footer — he noticed the typo. 

*Any questions for me?*
> Burial benefits… “Is there a section that says how benefits work? Who’s entitled to what, where, and why.”
