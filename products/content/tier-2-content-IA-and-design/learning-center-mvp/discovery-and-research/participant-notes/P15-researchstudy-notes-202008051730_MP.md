He is on desktop. 

*Intro…*
*I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about your benefits or VA account?*
> Yes. Have both benes and online acct with VA.

*What was that question about?*
> Getting help with PTSD. 
> 
> Went to site and cd not get answers. 10  yrs ago had complete PTSD breakdown. Was in Italy, trying to get admitted to PTSD program in the US. Took 2 weeks and took his supervisor calling the Pentagon to get them to call the VA to get me help. I was really drugged up (they were treating me), and I knew it was not right. 

*What was the first step you took to get that answered?*
> Email, phone, emails. Last day was on the phone for 4 hours calling from Italy and they hung up on me. 

*Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?*
> This morning. Using it quite a bit in last 10 yrs. “I can basically find about 90% of what I’m looking for in about 10 minutes.”

> “Once you get used to it, but that’s the hard part… Ppl like me with PTSD, we don’t have a lot of patience.” 

> “You’re supposed to get what you want in 4 clicks.” 

> Frustrating. “Sometimes you just give up bc you’re not getting the help you need.” 


*Prototype…*
   [https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4) 

*If you saw a section of VA.gov called “Learning Center”, what kinds of things would you expect to see there?*
> “LC” cd be anything: learning to nav the site, learning how to get an appt, maybe practical life stuff you need to know like balancing checkbook. 

*Imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. How would you do that?*
> I’d prob go into my acct. I also have “Healthy Vet.” I’d go there, into the acct section and try to change my address there. 

*Task 1: General impression*

*What is the main purpose and what you can do on this page?* 
> There is quite a bit of info, sites I can go to. He spent a good bit of time looking at top 2 boxes.

> I have no idea what fiduciary means. 

> Burials, that’s vey interesting. Just went thru that with my father. They were very helpful with getting a new plaque. 

> “It’s putting it all on 1 page instead of going, like I said, the 4 clicks.”

> Saw Women Vets link. 

> This gives you a “base of things to look for, all on 1 page. 

> Don’t see: Where do I get help if I’m overseas? Think it wd be under Disability.  I am 100 % disabled. Scrolling up and down page. There is no contact, no info. 

> You cd put “Healthcare for overseas veterans.” Click there to help you schedule healthcare. 

*Do you think name Learning Center makes sense for what you expected?*
> Yes. 

> Native American Direct Loan. I have 3 friends who are native Amers. DOn’t 

*What did you notice about the search?*
> Search LC: overseas medical assistance.

*Do you see you can search 2 diff ways?*
> 1 is centralized  in the LC. These are prob FAQs. If I cd not find info in the LC, I would click VA.gov and search for “residential PTSD programs.”

> “I don’t want an article. I want help.”

> 60% of the ppl coming home have PTSD> 

> Put “PTSD assistance” under Health Care. I don’t care about copay rates — I wd rather see PTSD.

> Infertility - “How many ppl think the VA should be used for infertility?”


*Task 2: Find article on a specific topic*

*Take a look at this page and tell me how you’d make sure VA has your new address. Think out loud.*
> I wd go to your account and profile info. If I didn’t have an acct, I’d create one. Or I’d go to “Sign in FAQs.” If I didn’t find it, I wd put “Change mailing address” in search and search LC first, then VA.gov. 

*Where else wd you look?* 
Looking down the page… Maybe in the records — I wd need to chg address for my records. 

*Any other links you might click on to make sure VA had your new address ?*
> I’d probably click View all VA acct and profile articles. 

> Expect to see 27 things related to address but nothing to change address. 

> The algorithm should look at all 3 words: change account address (or look at at least 2 of the 3)


*Task 3: Review topic results*
/Participant will be looking at the View all VA account and profile articles result screen./

*Would any of these articles help you figure out how to make sure VA had your new address?*
> Yes, Change address for your VA benes. You can chg it here. I guess you can mail it in or whatever. 

> “Should be simple. ‘Like I said, 4 clicks and I’m done.”

> Saw 2 ways to check status of claim. That is good. FAQ and Step by Step. 

> I might move the create account link (result) higher up the page. For this info to matter, you need an account. 

> I wd click Change address for your VA benes — NO I’d click How to change your VA address online. 

/Prototype has three clickable results: Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQsor How to change your address online./


*Task 4: Navigate between learning center articles*
/Participant should be on Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQsor How to change your address online article/.

*Does this page answer your question?*
> This page clearly states what you need. Pointing to bullets: Voc Rehab is really good. 

> Like step by step. 

> I usually sign in with MHV. If I didn’t have any of the options for sign in, I would create my acct. 

*Do you think this page wd answer your question?* 
> Yes. I like this.
> 
> Said the diff ways were good  bc what if you lost your phone.

*What if you thought one of the other articles you saw in the list would be better information, how would you get to that information?*
> “That’s the hard part bc there’s no back button.” There cd be an error. I’d like to see (going thru the top nav) “Back page” up here (next to main nav on the right). 

> It’s just an error if you can’t get back to this page. 

*Click on Learning Center. This takes you back.* 

*Click on View all VA account and profile articles again.* 

*Click on How to change your address online.* 

*To get to another article, do you think you would use the back button?* 
> Yes, I wd look for that first. A lot of Vets, like me, are not computer savvy. 


*Task 5: Navigating between topics, and between Hub and Learning Center*
	
/Participant should still be on Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQs, or How to change your address online article. /

*We’re going to shift gears now. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?*
> I wd probably go under Health care and then “View all health care articles bc there is no Agent Orange there. 

*Since this is a prototype, we don’t have all of that set up, so I’m going to send you a link you directly to a page.*

/Send participant link to Exposure to hazardous chemicals page in prototype/:   [https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4#/screens/424624543](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4%22%20%5Cl%20%22/screens/424624543) 

*Now again, scroll around, and take a look at this page.*

*How does this line up with what you expected to see?*
> Quiet, scrolled all the way down. “Um, yeah, for the most part.”

> The main thing is still Agent Orange. You have them in alpha order. 

> I didn’t know they called it Gulf War Illness. 

*If you wanted to know more about Agent Orange, what wd you do?* 
> Clicked the Agent Orange link in body of page. Went to LC page for Agent Orange. 

> Scrolling, quiet. Saw Bluewater Navy. Scrolled all the way down. 

> Learn how to file a claim is good. What if you switched the buttons so the learn button is 1st? It’s hard to fill out a claim. 

> I’d sit with my friend and go thru all the presumptive diseases first before we went anywhere else. Then the svc reqts. 

> I don’t see anything about the Brownwater Navy. 

*If you to learn more about how to file a claim…?*
> It’s right here — clicked the button. 

> Disability compensation, finding regional office — good. 

> “Distressing” to see how long it takes to get claim thru. But used to be longer. 

> It used to be that your first step was intent to file. 

> “This is really good.” 

He is on the LC Agent Orange page. 

*From here, show me how would you find more articles that might be of interest to the same group of readers.*
> I would enter /agent orange exposure Vietnam/ and hit search.
>  
*What do you expect to see?* 
> Articles about exposure. 

> Re: Topic and Audience buttons: It doesn’t look clickable. If it was blue, I wd think it was clickable. 

> On SERP after clicking on Viet Vets tag — he mentioned a few things he would click on (missed this). 
> 
> How do you like the organized of this page? 
> It’s fine that it’s not alphabetical order. Seems OK.

> Bluewater Navy was offshore. Barely exposed if at all. Mentioned Brownwater Navy. 

> FAQs, DMZ, Vietnam era. Then you go right into the Bluewater. (He is questioning this.)

> He likes this - “you get it in 1 click for the most important topics. “

*Post-Task Interview *
*From this screen, talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don’t already have - education, home loan, something like that.*
> I’d go back. (Think he means to homepage.) I’d put disability benefits and search. Pointed to home link in breadcrumbs. 

*What do you think of dividing this into LC and VA.gov?*
> That’s good. There are 3 different options. 

*We don’t know what to call the product you reviewed yet. Now that you have a better idea of the type of information that’s here, what you think of the name Learning Center?*
> Hm… “Information Center” sounds like Yellow Pages. If you could just give a description of the LC up top, it would help. Small 2-sentence paragraph saying what to find here would be helpful. 

*Overall, what, if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this learning center concept as a whole?*
> “There’s a lot of good info off the bat, but I wd look at prioritizing… Everything you’ve got here is a lower priority.’ (mentioned fertility again)

> Organize the Health care info by conflict/war. 

> Then you’d have Check all healthcare articles. 

> I was in Gulf War. 

*What do you think could be improved about what we’ve reviewed today?*
> “I’m very impressed. It’s a good step. It needs some refining.”

> Alpha order is good for old farts like me. 

> Cd have timeline. Asbestos and healthcare with the Bluewater Navy.
