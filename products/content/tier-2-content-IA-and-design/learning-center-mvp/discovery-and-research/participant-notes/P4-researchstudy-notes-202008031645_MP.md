4:45 pm

*Intro…*
*I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about your benefits or VA account?*
> I go thru it every day. Freq use MHV. Not sure if that’s the same.

*What was that question about?*
> I had ?s 3 years ago about my Educ benefits. 

> Disability ratings, too. See below.

*What was the first step you took to get that answered?*
> Searched the Internet. 

> 3 yrs ago revisited some of my disability ratings. Both times went online — found them more helpful that VA, which had so much info, was so dense. So many programs w/Educ benes. 

> Used Bing to search. 

> I am a data scientist by trade. I was researching the Dark Web. Trying to help mitigate Vets suicide.. Chatrooms. Advertising. Used special browser.  

*Did you have to take additional steps beyond that to get the answers you needed?*
> Talked to colleagues. Spoke to private Vets svc officer. She has company, helps Vets apply for benes. 

*What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?*
> Lot there, lot of interesting things I did not know. 
> “It’s good for the knowable unknowns.” 

> Can download reference manuals, pamphlets, Helpful. Cemetery info. 

*Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?*
> I was emailing with my primary care mgr. Was asking his nurse about a consult. 

*Was that a typical experience for you?*
> Yes. 

*Prototype…*
   [https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4) 

*If you saw a section of VA.gov called “Learning Center”, what kinds of things would you expect to see there?*
> FAQs. Wd expect it to cover all the benes, not just Educ. “Everything that’s in the pkg.”

> I found that Educ benes were diff if you are on active duty. Very confusing when I was active. 

> My info needs chgd a lot after I got out.

> Need to know: 
> * How do you prep for your ratiing?
> * Where is authoritative source?  
> * Which GI Bill? 
> * Can I transfer it to my dependents? 

*Imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. How would you do that?*
> (Laughs.) I wd look up local clinic, call contact number, then talk to their records person.

> I had this problem. I was enrolled in Richmond, chgd enrollment to DC. I have been in 4-5 diff regions. Rules are diff in diff regions. I cd fax my chg to DC but I had to drive to Richmond. 

*Task 1: General impression*

Prototype: 
[Loading Share Experience](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4)

> Looking around…
> Top nav: Helpful to let you find a VA location, which is confusing for ppl at first. Good to help new Vets understand benes. 

> “You have articles… Something for the workers.”
> Scrolled the whole page.

> Vets and suicide: Who will realize that a Vet needs help? I expect to see that at the top: if you are experiencing depression — that should be top link.

> Helpful to see disability rating and pay. Espec as it relates to taxes. 

> Like it broken out by benefit.

*What do you think about the different ways you can find information on this page?*
> Sees “show more” button. 
> Wd expect a pop up with most popular, most used hyperlinks. 

> Search button - I might be a little confused about searching LC versus searching VA.gov. 

> Is this person already logged in? Has VA account? 

> Liz - no. 

> He wd not expect that it’s logged in, but this implies I have to have a VA.gov account. Not sure I do. 

> Found block for account and profile. He moused over the “all “link. 

*Do you think name Learning Center makes sense for what you expected?*
> Yes. Likes name. 

*What did you notice about the search?*
> Saw radio buttons on in-page search. 

*How do you think this is different from the site search in the navigation?*
> If search VA.gov, wd get more high level, corp info — leadership, legislation, budget, annual report and metrics

> Top search box is for VA.gov  (think he understands that the all VA.gov search is same lower on page). 

> Checklist for widow or widower. Person who manages estate of deceased. Cd be kids of deceased. 

*Task 2: Find article on a specific topic*

*Going back to that scenario from earlier - imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. Please show me what you would normally do and continue to think out loud as you do so.*
> I wd be worried about my pay, and 1st abt my healthcare. 

*Take a look at this page and tell me how you’d make sure VA has your new address. Think out loud.*
> I would go to: 
> * Healthcare > articles 
> * General help?
> * Pension — how do I mk sure my taxes are right? 

> He wd approach it from benefit perspective. 

> I see records. What do you do if you are a Vet and you just moved? It’s hard to reenroll in a diff region. 

*Task 3: Review topic results*
/Participant will be looking at the View all VA account and profile articles result screen./

*Scroll around, and go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here.*
> Like that it has key topic bullets. Mks it easier to search. Not clear how they are ranked. Alpha?

> I like the audience — mks it quick for me to scroll thru the list. Makes easier for HC providers, volunteers. 

> I am part of an org that takes care of cemeteries. Challenging to take care of Confederate grave stones. 

*How does this line up with what you expected?*
> “Not quite what I expected. It’s cleaner than what I expected. I’m used to seeing a jumble of links.”

> Maybe color coding cd help with “sorting thru all these links.”

> The types (of results) are very diff: FAQ, About, general overview info about this or about that. 

“They’re all kind of step-by-steps, right?”

*There are some step-by-steps.* 

> I think step-by-step wd give a user manual. 
> Q&A just text. 
> Abt wd have text, maybe photos and flags. 

*Would any of these articles help you figure out how to make sure VA had your new address?*
> Saw first one: How to chg my address online, then clicked on lower result: “Chg your address for your benes”

> Frust for Vets: Depending on your benefit, you may be able to do this or that. 

> “Clean, easy to read.” 

> Scrolled down to help section. You might want to add description about why I wd call the VA 311. What does that do? 

> This answers how to chg my address. “I wish I had this a couple years ago.”

*How would you get to another article?* 
> I wd use back button. He did, went back to search results page. Then went back to same page for chg address for benes. 

> I wd write down the number, make notes, organize. Figure out who to call first. Looking at the “Benefit addresses you need to  contact the program to chg” section of page. 

*Task 4: Navigate between learning center articles*
/Participant should be on Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQsor How to change your address online article/.

*Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here.*
> Looking at step by step “how to change your address” page. “Cleaner and more colorful” than what I expected. 

> Saw Vets crisis line. “Good.” 

> A lot of times when you access a govt system, you see a pop-up. 

> “Very helpful.” “I think it’s good.” 

*Task 5: Navigating between topics, and between Hub and Learning Center*
	
/Participant should still be on Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQsor How to change your address online article. /

*We’re going to shift gears now. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?*
> I wd search for Agent Orange. 
> He went back to LC homepage. 
> I would search here. 

*Since this is a prototype, we don’t have all of that set up, so I’m going to send you a link you directly to a page.*

/Send participant link to Exposure to hazardous chemicals page in prototype/:   [https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4#/screens/424624543](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4%22%20%5Cl%20%22/screens/424624543) 

*How to help Vet who was exposed?*
> Likes blue box - “It tells me I’m not crazy.” Helpful. And for the volunteers… 

> So it has diff kinds of exposures. Drinking water, that’s famous. Burn pits. Gulf War Illness - might look for burn pits. 

> In Iraq, some guys were exposed to oil field burns, so to Iraqi chem weapons. 

> Saw Agent Orange. 

> Like that this page has facts and data. 

*Go ahead and see if you can find the information you’re looking for anywhere.*
> Good that it tells what Agent Orange is. Someone might be looking for grandfather, etc. Statement about certain illnesses. 

> My neighbor died a long time ago. 

> “It kind of clears up the mystery of how are you eligible… “ He went thru the criteria, thinking about his neighbor’s situation. 

> Presumptive diseases. 

*What would you do?*
> I wd go thru these criteria. If they fit the criteria, I wd assist them with filing the claim or talk to someone who knows the process better.

> Found the disability claim link.

> Again. what is the 311 phone number? 

> What is the G… (said a number)? Related to Gulf War. 

> Looking at disability application page — going thru it. Good. Other ways to do it is helpful. My mother refuses to use computer or Internet. 

> Helpful also - what to expect. 
> Updated metrics - nice.
> Intent to file is definitely important. I wd consider putting this in a diff color bc it kind of gets lost in here. Some Vets might not get that far down the page. They might not realize how financially helpful intent to file is. 

*Task 6: Review tag results*

/If participant is not already on LC page:/
*Can you please go back to the Agent Orange page we were just looking at? *

*From here, show me how would you find more articles that might be of interest to the same group of readers.*
> Related information block at bottom of page. 

Notice topics and audience here? Yes. 
> “I wouldn’t think they’d be clickable. Oh, it is.”
> Like this, all articles tagged. Maybe make it look clickable: hash tag, shadows, clickable color. But your design is clean. Don’t want to junk it up. 

> I think the Vets will learn to click on the tags. 

> (On search results, he clicked from the tag): “I would expect it to be more focused.”

> I want to see a check list. 

> FAQs - this is a secondary filter (referring to having clicked on the tag & arrived at another search results page).  

*Post-Task Interview *
*From this screen, talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don’t already have - education, home loan, something like that.*
> I wd prob go back to the top, to LC homepage. I would go back to the next box: VA loan box, for example. 

*From what you’ve seen today, can you describe how the learning center is different from overall site search?*
> Um… (paused for a while). Yeah, I think you wd get much more focused info about the condition or benefit. I wd not expect to find the Secretary’s prepared remarks to Congress. 

*We don’t know what to call the product you reviewed yet. Now that you have a better idea of the type of information that’s here, what you think of the name Learning Center?*
> It’s very good. Appropriate. 

*Say you went to VA.gov today and knew we had launched this product. How would you find it on the website?*
> I would pull down the little search thing and type in “LC” .. . if I didn’t see it. 

“Learning” and “Center” are such common words in our lang, so if the search doesn’t concatenate those, you would not get good results. 

*Overall, what, if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this learning center concept as a whole?*
> 1st thing that comes to mind is “Rosetta Stone.” 
> Vets across the country: Legion, VFW, etc are looking for info on their benefits. 

> I think this is strong enough. You don’t see many things like the Rosetta Stone. Espec you don’t see things like info on burn pits, Iraq. 

*What do you think could be improved about what we’ve reviewed today?*
> Other than what I mentioned earlier, OK, good to see the Vets crisis line. No, I think I’ve covered it. I mentioned something for the widow and other filters.

> Good work.
