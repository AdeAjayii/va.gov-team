*Highlights:* 
* uses MHV, would change address there but found it easily in LC
* what expect in “LC”: I would think that the LC wd start explaining your benefits from the very basic you would get if you served in the military through to what you would get if you have severe disabilities. Also file claim, get claim. 
* thinks LC homepage “covers just about every area of concern”
* this is good for older people — they don’t use computers
* likes categories — said more and more, you’re finding things that are “old-Veteran friendly.”
* lot of times spouses look for info
* knew to go to Disability for Agent Orange 
* if click topic tag from a search result, would expect articles to still be about Agent Orange. 
* kept looking for the info about another benefit in search results, didn’t find it. Said if you go back, I saw some under your other examples (referring to LC homepage). Sure you could search fo this info. 
* says VA.gov is where you apply for things
* thinks LC would take you to info quicker
* nicely laid out, simple and easy to use regardless of your age
* likes “LC” 
* to get to LC, if I didn’t see a tab for it, I would search for “LC” 

*Intro…*
*I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about your benefits or VA account?*
> No, I’ve learned over the years. Early on, I did have a lot of ?s about them. But I’ve learned what they are. 

*Do you remember how you got your ?s answered?*
> I wd sit with a man at the VA clinic. 

*What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?*
> Pretty good. It is improving. I am sure there is still desire — I don’t go in and look at a lot of things today. I just take it for granted that I have things under control and I know what I am supposed to be getting. 

*Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?*
> MHV, abt a week ago. Checking a refill on prescripts and appt schedule. 

*Was that a typical experience for you?*
> Yes. 

*Prototype…*
   [https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4) 

*If you saw a section of VA.gov called “Learning Center”, what kinds of things would you expect to see there?*
> I wd think that the LC wd start explaining your benes from the very basic you wd get if you served in the military thru to what u wd get if you have severe disabilities. 

> Also file claim, get claim. 

*Imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. How would you do that?*
> I go into MHV and there is a place that lists your address. 

*Liz - so you update it there?* 
> Yes. 

*Task 1: General impression*

*What do you think this page is for and what you can do here?* 
> Scrolled down a bit. It’s a pretty good website, even if you work for them. At least get started with everything you need to know, so they can assist you. 

*What do you think about the different ways you can find information on this page?*
> I like the way it’s set up. Pretty self explanatory and covers, from what I am seeing, “just about every area of concern.”

> I’m just scrolling thru it, looking. 

*Anything else you notice abt the page?* 
> No. 

*If you are looking to chg your address, what wd you do?* 
> On this page? (Quiet.) Let me get my eyes focused here. 

> You cd go into… It has… I’ll go back to it there… You scroll down, find articles. You can click on acct and profile. You can click on all acct and profile articles. Clicked chg address — is now on chg address search results (SERP).

> This is good, even for the older ones like me. The younger gen is so computer literate. Older ones don’t use computers.

> It’s broken down by all the categories, the questions you might have or what you need to do. In years past, you had to look harder to find things broken down by categories. More and more, you’re finding things that are “old-Veteran friendly.” 

> Lot of times spouse looks for info, She uses it more. This makes it easier. 

*Liz - how about how org?* 
> It’s in a good chronological… you can follow easily. 

> How to chg address. Chg address online (clicked on this one). 

> I am just scolling, looking. Prescripts, contacts, when you send letter from doc saying you have appt. 

> Yes, this wd answer my question. “Very easily.”
> 
> He used back button to go back to acct and profile search results.

*How would you help a Vet who wants to get compensation for Agent Orange?* 
> Scroll down to articles. Disability.

On Agent Orange Exposure page….
*How does this line up w/what you expected to see ?*
> Scrolling quietly, down and up. Went to bottom. “A good list of problems we’ve had with diff sprays and chemicals and things that they’ve used.”

On Agent Orange page for LC…
> This is good. File a disability claim. Learn how to file a claim. Presumptive diseases it causes. 

*What do next?* 
> Cd go to learn how to file a claim or click on file if you already have the info you need. If not, you will have to get in to see a VA doc and have a physical so they can determine the problem he has (the friend). 

*Your next step?* 
> Click Learn how to file a disability claim. 

*How does this line up with what you expect?* 
> Scrolling quietly. Paused at “Can I file my claim online?” 

> “It’s very thorough. I like the way it’s laid out.” He was on the gray box saying it takes VA average 105.9 days to make a decision. 
> 
> He commented on how long it took VA to make decisions on him. About 405 days.

*Go back a page. How find articles of interest to same group of readers?* 
> Under topics: Disability, healthcare. There would be info there. 

*What happen if click?* 
> Expect it wd break down farther to list types of disability or health care, articles written, how the VA has changed their attitude towards Agent Orange over the years. 

Yes, wd expect articles wd still be abt Agent Orange. 

*Go ahead and click on Audience link. How does this align with your expectations?*
> Like the way it’s laid out. It even goes into Blue Water Navy, those folks that serviced the planes. Several videos on Blue Water Navy Act. 

*Articles are about?* 
> One is for Veteran or family member; other is on presumptive diseases it causes. 

*See the listing?*
> Yes, 1 is FAQs. Typically printed questions and answers. 

*I am interested in the differences, in how you perceive them.* 

*Post-Task Interview *
*From this screen, talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don’t already have - education, home loan, something like that.*
Scrolling around on search results (clicked on Vietnam War audience) with Blue Water Navy Act. I wd go thru all of these and look for that info.

*How wd you find that info from this page?* 
> He keeps scrolling on the Vietnam War Vets search results.  I don’t see one for GI Bill benefits, but if you go back, I saw some under your other examples. There are other pages it may come up under. 

*If they didn’t address the radio buttons above the search bar, get their perspective on that.*
> Yes, I have noticed it. I’m sure you can find it that way (other benes ^ ).

> You can type in GI Bill benefits (on-page search). 

*LL - what do you notice abt the search?* 
> It’s highlighted in blue, so that’s a good thing. 

*LL - how you und the 2 options?* 
> 1 is LC, and the other is VA.gov, the actual page that wd take you to everything you need to do to apply for it. 

*LL - how diff from the 1st search?*
> The (pointing to LC search) wd take you to info quicker. If you want to apply for it, you cd search VA.gov — it would take you to the page to fill out and apply for it. 

*We don’t know what to call the product you reviewed yet. Now that you have a better idea of the type of information that’s here, what you think of the name Learning Center?*
> I like the way it’s laid out. A lot of thought has gone into it. It makes it very simple and easy for somebody to use, regardless of your age. 

*That name “LC” captures that for you?* 
> Yes. 

*Say you went to VA.gov today and knew we had launched this product. How would you find it on the website?*
> Go to VA.gov and if it didn’t have a tab that popped up to catch your eye that said LC, I wd type LC in the search bar. 

*Overall, what, if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this learning center concept as a whole?*
> There’s nothing I find that’s not helpful. Any time you can just break it down for the Vets of any age and their spouses. Like that “it’s broken down and folks can fairly easily find the area that they’re looking at.” 

*What do you think could be improved about what we’ve reviewed today?*
“No, I really like the way it’s laid out.” I would be able to go in and fairly easily find the info you’re looking at. 

*Any questions for me?*
> “No, I like it. When are you all going to... (launch) it?”

*Hopefully by end of this year, beginning of next year.*
> “That’ll be good.” 
> “I appreciate everything you do.” In the early days, they were “killing trees;” everything was on paper.
