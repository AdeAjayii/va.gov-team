# Learning Center MVP Research Study Session Notes
## Participant 10, 8/4/2020, 1:15pm EST

**Can you remember a time you had a question about your benefits or account?**

Yes I've had questions in the last 1-2 days about my benefits and the status of my appeals.

**Let's talk more about a specific one. You said your pills?**

No, my appeals, but that's another thing. Finding my prescriptions, it seems like all of these sites, they're all split up.  You're gonna have a site that's for your healthcare, maybe your benefits should be there. But that's just my opinion, You have to go to 2-3 different sites, remember the passwords. Not all of these Veterans have a CAC card and it's hard to remember all of that.

**First step you took to get questions answers?**

Went to e-benefits first. But then I had to confirm my password, so it sends me to MHV, you have to confirm your ID on another website, and then go back to that site. 

[talks about going back and forth between sites to log in and verify identify]

It would make more sense if they put everything together, or if they put it on one site, and then they divide it up. Instead you're going to three unrelated sites to verify your information, just to log in. It's not good.

And then you end up where you *think* you're supposed to be for the question, and you click on a link and it says "Oh we moved that to VA.gov", and you're like, "Oh you bastards, you got me!"

**So it seems like you had to bounce around a lot to get those questions answered**

Honestly, I didn't even get the answer. I ended up calling the 1-800-number

I have to bounce around to 2-3 different sites to find out what it is. You click on eBenefits and it’s telling you to go to VA.gov

**How has your experience been getting questions answered on VA.gov?**

I think they're not, I think, they're basically template questions. But sometimes, they don't always have questions. Like I said, mine is an appeal, or if I want to find out what documents have been submitted with an appeal. Or if I want to look for medications that I have, I think they are in MHV. Once again, I have you bounce around to 2-3 different sites to find where stuff is. If I go to eBenefits it tells me to go to VA.gov because we moved it.

**Moderator: What does the term learning center mean to you?**

Participant: Most of the sites it’s either a write up of how to use the site, or if it had to do with education benefits it may be something like that… mostly I assume a tutorial on how to use the site.

**Moderator: What would you do to learn about how to change your address?**

Participant: considering what I just told you, and I have to go… you got to login to eBenefits.gov. But there is two different processes you could either put the address update in eBenefits or you could go into … the same one you go to verify your information… could be my DS login to verify your information and it also has where the VA can contact you and if you have a work email or military ID it has your contact information there. 

**Moderator: shares link**

Participant starts breaking up a lot

**Moderator: shares her screen with participant, lots of technical issues**

Participant: this is what I hate, it reminds me of the VA

**Moderator: tell me what this page is for and what you think you can do here**

Participant: first of all I don’t like the (font?) on this. It’s just too much on the page, I don’t know maybe you all should consider like drop down menus for here… if I’m really trying to find something and I’m in a hurry, going all the way down here, that’s just too much. Maybe you all should do this in dropdowns. If you’re looking for something and you’re already not finding it, you’re just overhwhelmed.

I would just start Googling stuff I’d leave the site. Then most likely it would bring me back.

I do like the breakdown… some of these titles are a little too long. “Housing” and “Housing assistance” can be combined somehow…. 

Disability, if it’s not related to a veteran’s disability that name should be changed… it should link back to eBenefits it should explain to them that’s where they need to know. I noticed you all like leading people back and forth. 

If I’m looking for something, for instance, the nearest VA. Have you already tried looking up the nearest VA on this site? It’s like peeling a freaking onion. Find VA locations, then you have to scroll down and there is a map. You have to make 4 or 5 clicks before you actually make it. Maybe don’t put the map there, just break it down…. I don’t think nobody’s told them that because it’s been like that for years.

I would rather go to Google

When you have all these links… there’s a bunch of clutter here that means nothing to me

**Moderator: imagine you recently moved, from here what would you normally do**

Participant: first think I would look for was a link that said registration or something… profile information and creating accounts.. I figure something over here (Your VA account) and something here that says profile or update profile… but it’s peeling the onion… there should be something that summarizes “your profile information or update your information”

I was going to see if that search thing works but it doesn’t… I would go up to search and I would enter profile or login… most of the time you have to login just to get in there. Something on profile or status or update or something. Usually when you login, you can go to the profile with some man shaped icon and it has all your profile information. That’s where I would normally go. 

**Moderator: click on “view all” what do you think**

Once again the text throws me off, it just looks jumbled.. it gives me dread because I know I’m on VA site, I’m not going to find what I want… that topic means nothing to me. Maybe those tags should be hidden… that means nothing to me

Change your address for VA benefits… ok so that’s there… why are there so many “Change your address” and “How to change your VA address.”

One’s a step by step and one’s an about… that means the same thing… an About page that’s just a summary. And a step by step I’m going to walk you through.. step 1 login, step 2 select your profile… as far as an about, there shouldn’t be an about page. Nice try though.

I wouldn’t go to about, I would click on how to change your VA address online… I would click on sign in… and then it’s going to be taking me to those 3 magical sites just to get on one site… I don’t know if I’ve ever seen this part where it verifies your identity…

**Moderator: does this page answer your question?**

Not really… normally when you go to a VA page you want to find answers something that has to do with your health or something that’s a benefit.

Moderator: from here let’s say you thought one of the other articles was better how would you get back?

I would basically just hit back (on the browser).

**Moderator: imagine you’re on this page and then you have another thing you needed to do, you need to find out how to get compensation for a veteran that has been**

I would go back up and search the learning center. I wouldn’t search VA.gov since I’m in the learning center. I would search for agent orange benefit, I would wait for that to come up. If that was something that wasn’t relevant like an article then I would go search the whole site (change bullet to search VA.gov).  Then I would do command F and just search the page.

**Moderator: ok let’s say you searched and went to this page (sent link)**

OK well is it going to provide me with some instructional way of filling out paperwork… start to scan to see if the information is relevant. The only problem is it’s listing all of this other stuff. There should be a link taking you somewhere to either file a claim or… there should be a link dedicated to agent orange (seems like he doesn’t see that the headers are links on this page – why are the headers links anyway?) I didn’t even know that it was clickable.

There is too much blue on the page! It’s like blue ink and this dreaded text. Use something happier!

Did you think the topic label was clickable?

No I just like rectangles

**What would you do next?**

I would read it… this is just a quick summary of it… and then everything else goes down… what I’m most interested in is how I file a disability claim.. maybe this should go inside (the CTA buttons). I think this is actually helpful. I would click file a disability claim. I know I have to file a claim. Maybe if I didn't, if I had no disabilities and I'm new to this, then lets Learn how to file a claim.

*clicks to benefit hub page*

Okay, what does it say here? *scrolling* Does it say I have to go somewhere? You can still file a claim. Okay, so when to file, click on that, it'll tell me what evidence do I need [reads information on page,] It would've been better if they had started with this information (toward bottom of page) at the top. I don't want to go all the way down here to find this [important] information.  That's just me.

***moderator guides back to agent orange page, asks about tags***

The topics and audience, that should be something that should be hidden. Something that's part of a tag within the site, but the user shouldn't see that. Once again, everybody's not going to understand what you mean by audience. Everybody's, they're going to look at some of this stuff and say OK Topics and be like "does this even apply to me?"  I see audience and it says Vietnam War Veterans, and I'm an Iraqi war veteran - if I ain't got no common sense, I be like this doesn't even apply to me, and I'm going to leave the site and go to YouTube or something, and see how you do it.

That's why it sort of threw me off. And then all this blue on this page, you can't really tell.  I'm going to go over to the actual VA.gov website.

*goes to VA.gov homepage* 

You see all this blue?! Same text. Everything - see, you can tell those are all clickable. *Scrolls down* But when they're large...there is so much stuff to click. It sort of throws me off.

*Moderator guides back to Agent Orange page*

**If you go ahead and click on that Vietnam war veterans tag, I'm interested to see what you think about when you click on that.**

Uh, first off this thing at the top (*mouses over header and intro text*) You don't even need that. It doesn't even seem like it went where I need to be when I clicked on it.

That {h2} makes sense, that seems like that's where I need to be. Yeah, yeah. TO summarize what the person is looking for and put keyword and article tag right there, *scrolls search results* this is actually good. But like I said, I don't think these topics and audience tags, that the end users really need to see that.

**From this screen, talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don't already have**

Once again, just like the agent orange, I would actually type up - let's say that I'm new and I don't know how. So the first thing I would do is start searching on the page, how do I apply for VA benefits? If I know to come here, then I would go to search va.gov because I wouldn't know what the learning center was because I wouldn't have been exposed to the VA and all it's menus yet. So, I would start to search and put VA benefits or VA compensation, or whatever the disability is. [lists conditions] That's what I'd search for. If it's like this page, there'd be something that says "Apply for VA benefits for" and it would start to list conditions and break down how to apply for them. And at the end result, they should all have links to tell you how to apply for it and where the form is.

**Sounds like your approach to that would be a pretty specific search with keywords**

Yeah, exactly.

**Now that you see what's in this center and you have a better idea of the type of information what do you think of the name Learning Center**

I don't like it.  It's dry, it doesn't make me want to be there. I don't know. It's like...I don't know how to describe it. Learning Center it should be something else that makes people think that they *should* go there. Once again, it's making me think I'm going to be there to look at a PDF about the site, or see some videos someone filmed at home and posted on the VA site.

**How would you find it on the website if you knew we had launched this product?**

Okay, you see here at the top, this Veterans Crisis line? *mouses over header* That shouldn't be at the top. You should have something, a banner, going across the top. Maybe in green, please no more blue. "Try our new such and such" Just like KFC! Put it at the top of this page, because that's where people are going to look.

Whether you know you do or not, the first thing you do when a site starts to look, you're looking at that top thing. So I'm going to go there - you notice this.  We pretty much, we see this red thing right here and we don't pay attention to it anymore. Most of us, we aren't going through a crisis unless it's the crisis of browsing the VA site.

**What if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this concept as a whole.**

I'll go with the pros. The pros is the searchability. As long as stuff is linked. Once again, this page is a good example. But this *(mousing over header and intro)* this shouldn't be what people see if it doesn't pertain to what the people want to see when they click on link. 

It's okay that this is here and it says articles tagged. But you don't need this - you don't already know where they are. That's too long and that text totally throws me off. Everything else that's connected - once again,  The topics and audicen like I said, shouldn't be there. If they're looking for something specific they search those keywords, they'll search those articles just like any other site. To me , putting so much on a page, and then the VA site is so bland.

Do you see this blue black and white? The only thing I think is like blue and black, is a white boxer. That's not fun unless you like gettin beat! Yeah, the site is just too bland. And the way the page, it's boring also. Maybe some of those sub menus [makes design suggestions] to make people want to look at it.

If you're looking at black and white, you can't look at it too long unless you're a book nerd who wants to have bad vision after many years.

[continues design critique regarding color, borders, and typography]

I think you lose users on websites if you can't keep them entertained.

I think this is a good idea and most of the information can be compressed under menus and drop downs.

I can honestly say the only time I come to VA.gov is by mistake, like those other sites leading me here.
