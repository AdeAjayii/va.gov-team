… missed beginning  sorry!!

I have to bounce around to 2-3 different sites to find out what it is. You click on eBenefits and it’s telling you to go to VA.gov

**Moderator: What does the term learning center mean to you?**

Participant: Most of the sites it’s either a write up of how to use the site, or if it had to do with education benefits it may be something like that… mostly I assume a tutorial on how to use the site

**Moderator: What would you do to learn about how to change your address?**

Participant: considering what I just told you, and I have to go… you got to login to eBenefits.gov. But there is two different processes you could either put the address update in eBenefits or you could go into … the same one you go to verify your information… could be my DS login to verify your information and it also has where the VA can contact you and if you have a work email or military ID it has your contact information there. 

**Moderator: shares link**

Participant starts breaking up a lot

**Moderator: shares her screen with participant, lots of technical issues**

Participant: this is what I hate, it reminds me of the VA

**Moderator: tell me what this page is for and what you think you can do here**

Participant: first of all I don’t like the (font?) on this. It’s just too much on the page, I don’t know maybe you all should consider like drop down menus for here… if I’m really trying to find something and I’m in a hurry, going all the way down here, that’s just too much. Maybe you all should do this in dropdowns. If you’re looking for something and you’re already not finding it, you’re just overhwhelmed.

I would just start Googling stuff I’d leave the site. Then most likely it would bring me back.

I do like the breakdown… some of these titles are a little too long. “Housing” and “Housing assistance” can be combined somehow…. 

Disability, if it’s not related to a veteran’s disability that name should be changed… it should link back to eBenefits it should explain to them that’s where they need to know. I noticed you all like leading people back and forth. 

If I’m looking for something, for instance, the nearest VA. Have you already tried looking up the nearest VA on this site? It’s like peeling a freaking onion. Find VA locations, then you have to scroll down and there is a map. You have to make 4 or 5 clicks before you actually make it. Maybe don’t put the map there, just break it down…. I don’t think nobody’s told them that because it’s been like that for years.

I would rather go to Google

When you have all these links… there’s a bunch of clutter here that means nothing to me

**Moderator: imagine you recently moved, from here what would you normally do**

Participant: first think I would look for was a link that said registration or something… profile information and creating accounts.. I figure something over here (Your VA account) and something here that says profile or update profile… but it’s peeling the onion… there should be something that summarizes “your profile information or update your information”

I was going to see if that search thing works but it doesn’t… I would go up to search and I would enter profile or login… most of the time you have to login just to get in there. Something on profile or status or update or something. Usually when you login, you can go to the profile with some man shaped icon and it has all your profile information. That’s where I would normally go. 

**Moderator: click on “view all” what do you think**

Once again the text throws me off, it just looks jumbled.. it gives me dread because I know I’m on VA site, I’m not going to find what I want… that topic means nothing to me. Maybe those tags should be hidden… that means nothing to me

Change your address for VA benefits… ok so that’s there… why are there so many “Change your address” and “How to change your VA address.”

One’s a step by step and one’s an about… that means the same thing… an About page that’s just a summary. And a step by step I’m going to walk you through.. step 1 login, step 2 select your profile… as far as an about, there shouldn’t be an about page. Nice try though.

I wouldn’t go to about, I would click on how to change your VA address online… I would click on sign in… and then it’s going to be taking me to those 3 magical sites just to get on one site… I don’t know if I’ve ever seen this part where it verifies your identity…

**Moderator: does this page answer your question?**

Not really… normally when you go to a VA page you want to find answers something that has to do with your health or something that’s a benefit.

Moderator: from here let’s say you thought one of the other articles was better how would you get back?

I would basically just hit back (on the browser).

**Moderator: imagine you’re on this page and then you have another thing you needed to do, you need to find out how to get compensation for a veteran that has been**

I would go back up and search the learning center. I wouldn’t search VA.gov since I’m in the learning center. I would search for agent orange benefit, I would wait for that to come up. If that was something that wasn’t relevant like an article then I would go search the whole site (change bullet to search VA.gov).  Then I would do command F and just search the page.

**Moderator: ok let’s say you searched and went to this page (sent link)**

OK well is it going to provide me with some instructional way of filling out paperwork… start to scan to see if the information is relevant. The only problem is it’s listing all of this other stuff. There should be a link taking you somewhere to either file a claim or… there should be a link dedicated to agent orange (seems like he doesn’t see that the headers are links on this page – why are the headers links anyway?) I didn’t even know that it was clickable.

There is too much blue on the page! It’s like blue ink and this dreaded text. Use something happier!

Did you think the topic label was clickable?

No I just like rectangles

What would you do next?

I would read it… this is just a quick summary of it… and then everything else goes down… what I’m most interested in is how I file a disability claim.. maybe this should go inside (the CTA buttons). I would click file a disability claim. I know I have to file a claim.
