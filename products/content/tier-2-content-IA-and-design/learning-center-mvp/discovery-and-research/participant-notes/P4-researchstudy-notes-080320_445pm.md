# P4 Research study notes: Learning center MVP research 08/03/20, 4:45 pm ET
# Conversation Guide 


## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.  We have a team working on a new web product on VA.gov that will help you find answers to questions about VA benefits and services, and your VA.gov account.  Today, I'd like to hear about your experience getting questions answered, and go through a prototype of this new web product and get your thoughts on it.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, I want to hear your honest opinions.** I'm not testing your ability, and there are no right or wrong answers. Our team wants to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your honest feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** It may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **I'd like to I record my screen and audio as we talk today, if that's alright with you.** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable with me recording screen and audio for our session?

>nodding

*Start recording.*

- **I've started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

>Yes I'm comfortable

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about your benefits or VA account?

>i go through every day - mhv, not sure if that's the same. i had questions 3 yrs ago about my educational benefits

- What was that question about? 

>searched the internet. also around the same time, my disability ratings. both times went online different sites. more helpful than the va site. because it's so dense. so many programs, especially education. and more about my disability ratings. 

- What was the first step you took to get that answered? 
>used Bing. at the same time i was - i'm a data scientist by trade. we were researching the dark web to see what kinds of misinformation was happening - dark web, veteran suicides, reddit - and also where veterans advertising. 

- Did you have to take additional steps beyond that to get the answers you needed?
>yes. talked to colleagues. spoke to private VSOs. she has a company and she helps veterans apply for benefits. 

- What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?
> it was all there, lots of interesting things. good for the knowable unknowns. good to download the reference materials, pamphlets. very useful. 

- Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?
>i was exchanging info eamils with primary care manager. asking his nurse about progress of a consult.

- Was that a typical experience for you?
> yes.

- Okay, thanks for sharing that. Just a couple more questions before we start getting into the prototype. 
  - If you saw a section of VA.gov called "Learning Center", what kinds of things would you expect to see there?
  >learning center. um - faqs. expect it to cover all the benefits, not just education but everything. one thing i found was someone is on active duty, and getting off active duty, we had someone VSO helping us. it was very confusing because not familiar with VA. i would expect ppl transition out. how to prepare for - how to get the rating. authoritative information about education benefits, can i transfer to my dependents, that kind of thing. 
  
  
  - Imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address.  How would you do that?
  >laughs. i would look up the local clinic, region, and contact their contact number, and work from there. because this happened to me, with moving. i'm at 4-5 different regions - in DC i could fax my registration. but in Fairfax i had to DRIVE there. 
  
  

### Things to watch for

- What has happened in the past when they've tried to answer questions on our website?  
- Might they have familiarity with the benefit hubs already?
- Do they default to google? Or site search?  Calling someone?  
- What do veterans think is in a “learning center”?

## Task 1: General impression - 5 minutes

- Okay, thank you for explaining that to me.  Now I'm going to have you share your screen, and then I'll send you a link to a prototype so we can look at that together. 
  - *Use chat to send user link to prototype, starting on home page of learning center.* https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4
  - *Talk user through screen sharing so they can share their screen.*
- Take a look at this page, scroll around. Tell me what this page is for and what you think you can do here. It'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible moving forward. 

>helpful it helps you find a va location. this has both health care and benefits. search bar. articles. you have transitioning service members. somethig for workers. va was advertising on the oxygen channel - who's gonna know if someone is facing suicidal problems - family... i don't see suicide in here. like if you're experiencing depression, top link. 
>
>i like the disability,i like how it's broken out - life insurance, yeah it's all helpful. 

- What do you think about the different ways you can find information on this page? 
>scrolls back up. show more button. oh this is a prototype. i expect a popup - most heavily used. ok, search button here.
>
>confused about search lc and va.gov - what would be different.
>
>ok so va.gov account. so this person is already logged in? 
>
>for me i would ask, i infer that i'm supposed to have a va.go act but i'm not sure that i do. creating a va.gov account - oh great. i want to know. 


*If participant hasn't commented on these items on their own, ask:*

- Do you think name `Learning Center` makes sense for what you expected? 
>oh yeah

- What did you notice about the search?
>search va.gov i think i would get more high level, corporate info as opposed to the learning center - more tactical info. like va.gov - annual reports, executive bios. 

- How do you think this is different from the site search in the navigation?
>for va. gov and the [bar ] is just a nice option to have here
>
>i would like to see - [family member info] - becaus i notice you have somehting for fiduciaries. so what do you do if you're managing the veterans estate. 


### Things to watch for

- What was the participants initial response to the page?
>

- What did they say about the name "Learning center"?
>

- What did they say about the difference between site search and this page?
>


## Task 2:  Find article on a specific topic - 5 minutes 

- Going back to that scenario from earlier - imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. Please show me what you would normally do and continue to think out loud as you do so.

>boy. if you're a veteran. where would i go. i'd be worried about myhealth care. so i'd go to health care first. then maybe general. oh and pension - like to make sure my taxes for pension payments go to the right place. 
>
>but i see here your va records. so what do you do if you're a veteran who died, if you just moved. it's hard to re-enroll when you move. 

- Since this is a prototype, not everything will work as you might expect, but it'll be very helpful to hear and see how you'd interact with it if it were a live website.

- Take a look at this page, and tell me how you'd make sure VA has your new address. Think out loud. 

>

  *`View all VA account and profile articles` link is a clickable hotspot*

  *Allow participant to go through entire page before prompting them to click.*

*If participant hasn't commented on these items on their own, ask:*


- What are your impressions of how the page is organized? 

>ok i like it has the key topic, easier to search. not clear how they're ranked. alphabetical? or not? i like the audience. veterans, dependents. makes it quick to scroll through the list. you'd have VSOs, or volunteers who drive vets around, veterans of foreign wars. like i'm part of a org that takes care of cemeteries. 
>
>you have ppl like that niche audiences to learn about how do i replace a confederate gravestone and stuff. 
>
>not what i expected. it's cleaner than what i expected. i expected a jumpble of links, that's hard to understand. 
>
>maybe color coding? to sort through these links? here's step by step, here's a faqs, maybe you can put them in 4 boxes or 2 boxes. although they're all knind of... but they're all kind of stept by steps? 
>
>i would expect user manual. about would have text, flags, and stuff. 


*If participant would only use search:*

- Is there another way besides search that you'd try to find this information?

>there we go - how do i change my address for va benefits and online.


*If participant doesn't find hotspot:* 

- Have you noticed any place you can click? No problem. For the purpose. Of this prototype - see the `View all VA Account and profile articles` link? Go ahead and click that.
>oh good, it tells you which are which, ones you can change online and not. very clean, easy to read. i like this - more help, hotline, mhv (looking at ph #s.) oh there's a chatbot - interesting. 
>
>maybe more description about the 311 - when do i call that?
>
>very nicely, i wish i had this couple years ago. 


### Things to watch for

- Did the participant notice the search bar?
- What were the participant's comments on the `Search` radio buttons above the search bar?
- Do users notice or get confused between the search link in the top nav (which opens to a search box) and the in-page search with the radio buttons?
- Participant reaction to audience and topic tags and content?
- Did the participant decide to look up information on the topic by searching or scanning the page links?

## Task 3: Review topic results - 3 minutes

*Participant will be looking at the `View all VA account and profile articles` result screen.*

- Ok great! Now again, scroll around, and go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here. 

- How does this line up with what you expected?

>

- Would any of these articles help you figure out how to make sure VA had your new address?

>


  *Prototype has three clickable results: `Change your address on file w/ the VA`, `Sign in FAQs`or `How to change your address online`*

- What helped you determine that article was the right one for you?

>


- Great, go ahead and click and see if you can find the info you're looking for.

### Things to watch for

- Is the format of each search result helpful, or is a link farm more appropriate?
- Is the format of the topic articles results page sufficient and helpful to the participant?
- What were the participant's comments, if any, on the topic and audience tags for each result?
- Do the template labels help the user choose the most relevant article to their search?

## Task 4: Navigate between learning center articles - 5 minutes

*Participant should be on `Change your address on file w/ the VA`, `Sign in FAQs`or `How to change your address online` article*

- Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here.

>i'd go back to the [results]. use the back usually. what i would do next, maybe i'm old school. i'd get a pencil and write this down, make a checklist.
>
>like champva - phone numbers. 


- Does this page answer your question?

>


- What if you thought one of the other articles you saw in the list would be better information, how would you get to that information?

>


- Okay, and based on this article, show me what you would do next.

>


  *Encourage participant to click on hotspot if they have not done so already*. 

  - *On How to change address online page, hotspot is in alert, and to related info section at bottom of page*

  - *On Change address on file page, hotspot is in body text*

  - *Sign in FAQs page, hotspot is in to related info section at bottom of page*

    

*Once on new page:*

- How does this line up with what you expected? [user prompted to go to  to how to  change online step by step]

>this is helpful. tells me what happens behind the scenes - nice, pictures. 
>
>it's cleaner and more colorful looks more real (compared to what he expected)
>
>scrolls pages
>
>your address. 
>
>is there a [scrolling] maybe not. lot of times when you access a government system... this is helpful tells me exactly what to expect. 
>
>related information - very nice. 
>
>i think it's good. 

- Excellent, you're being really helpful. Thank you. Just a few more things to go over.

### Things to watch for

- Did the participant get confused navigating between articles?
- How did the experience align with participant's expectations?


## Task 5: Navigating between topics, and between Hub and Learning Center - 5 minutes

*Participant should still be on `Change your address on file w/ the VA`, `Sign in FAQs`or `How to change your address online` article*

- We're going to shift gears now. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?

>do it or talk through it? 
>
>first thing - search for agent oragne in the search bar here. 
>
>or go back to the lc. and search. 
>
>


  *May need to remind user that things might not work as expected since this is a prototype*

- Thanks for sharing that. Since this is a prototype, we don't have all of that set up, so I'm going to send you a link you directly to a page. 

*Send participant link to Exposure to hazardous chemicals page in prototype*: https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4#/screens/424624543

- Now again, scroll around, and take a look at this page. Please continue to think out loud - you're doing a great job with that.
>here we go. /scrolls/ actually it's better than what i expected. the blue box is helpful. 
>
>/scrolls more/ okay it has diff kinds of exposures. lejenue, that's famous. 
>
>burn pits? /scrolls/ there was a lot of gulf war stuff for burn pits. 
>
>here we go under specific hazards - for burn pits. gulf war illness or burn pits. and agent orange is here. 

- How does this line up with what you expected to see? 

>it has specifics - like 60000 veterans - i like it has some actual facts and data. 
>
>

- Okay, that's good to know. Go ahead and see if you can find the information you're looking for anywhere.

>clicks to AO page


*This should take participant to LC Agent Orange article*

- Now, how does this line up with what you expected?

>it tells you what AO is. 
>
>my neighbor died of it. 
>
>/reads and scrolls/ 
>
>it's good it has nice clear like what makes you eligible. i have to think through this. and/or. then presumptive diseases, okay, cancers, good. 
>
>then service history - what do you do next - file a claim. 

- Based on this information, what would you do next?

>i would go back to the veteran to talk through if they're [eligible according to this]. then i would assist them with filing a claim. or there we go - file a disability claim. 
>
>c-123 hotline - that's helpful. i'm not sure. 

- *If participant doesn't want to click Learn How to File a claim button:*
  - Okay, now imagine you wanted to take it a step further and see how you would go about getting that compensation. What would you do?
  
  >
  

*After participant clicks Learn How to File Claim*

- And, once again, how does this page line up with what you expected to find? 

>i like that it's fresh. this tells me - about the coronavirus pandemic - someone is maintaining this website- that gives me confidence. 
>
>how to prepare - that's good. 
>
>/scrolls/ 
>
>oh other ways to do it, that's helpful. my mother refuses to use the computer so she would need this. 
>
>check status - that's helpful. 
>
>intent to file is important. 
>
>i would consider intent to file in a different color. cause it gets lost in here. some veterans might never get to that part. and not realize how impactful the intent to file date is to them. 

### Things to watch for

- How does user expect to be able to get to unrelated topic information?
- Did the participant navigate easily between the benefit hub and learning center?
- Did the participant get confused at any point going back and forth?
- What changes did the participant notice between LC and hub?


## Task 6: Review tag results -  3 minutes

- Great, thank you! We're almost done.  One more thing I'd like to get your feedback on. 

  *If participant is not already on LC page:*

  Can you please go back to the Agent Orange page we were just looking at? 
  
  >/goes there/
  
- From here, show me how would you find more articles that might be of interest to the same group of readers.

>/scrolls/ - related information. right here. 


  *If participant doesn't click on audience tag*. 

  - Did you notice the audience and topic labels?

  >yes i did

  - What would you expect to happen if you clicked on one?

  >i don't know. i would not think they're clickable. oh it is. look at that. 

  - Did you think they were clickable?

  >no. 


  - Go ahead and click on the audience label.

  - > maybe hashtag, or 3 dimensional, make more obvious . i think this is a good balance - not 8  of them. 

*User lands on Learning center articles tagged: Vietnam War Veterans page.*

- Great! Take a look at this page. How does it align with what you'd expect? 

>i think i like it's focused on the audience. but same questions - maybe more relevant - q/a, i understand. oh video, that's new. yeah so now i understand - checklist - i want to find a checklist. 
>
>a secondary filter - like by checklist. 
>
>helpful presentation of this information. 

- What do you think about how this information is presented?
>

- *If participant doesn't comment on tags:*
  - Are there any aspects to the page that you think are interactive?
  
  >
  
  
  - What would you expect if you click on one of the audience or topic tags?
  
  >
  
  
  - Did you notice any articles that sound like they could be the same?
  >
  
  - What differences do you notice between them?

### Things to watch for

- Did the participant realize the topic and audience tags were clickable?
- If not, why not?
- What did they think the tags would do?
- Are the tag results useful?
- Is the format helpful to the participant?

## Post-Task Interview - 8 minutes

Excellent, this has all been so helpful. Just a few more questions for you before we wrap up.  

- From this screen, talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don't already have - education, home loan, something like that.

>from here? 
>
>i would go back to the top. to the learning center. and i would go to the box - click on the va loan box. 
>
>


- Got it, thanks. That's helpful. From what you've seen today, can you describe how the learning center is different from overall site search?
>yeah, much more focused information about the actual condition or benefit. i would not expect to find - the secretary's comments in front of congress i would not expect to find that. 

  - If they didn't address the radio buttons above the search bar, get their perspective on that.
  >

- We don't know what to call the product you reviewed yet. Now that you have a better idea of the type of information that's here, what you think of the name `Learning Center`?

>very appropriate

- Say you went to VA.gov today and knew we had launched this product. How would you find it on the website?

>from va.gov? i would pull down the little search thing and type in learning center. if i didn't see it . but the [site] search engines are pretty poor. get a lot of noise. because learning and center are such common words. from the va website.

- Overall, what, if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this learning center concept as a whole?

>first thing - you  know rosetta stone - that's something veterans - this guy want to va, to an online forum, to the legion. this is the authoritative source for accessing your benefits. it could be that. at least in my discussions with buddies - ppl are constantly searching for the best information. 
>
>like for recent things like burn pits. iraq conditions. 

- What do you think could be improved about what we've reviewed today?

>scrolls: other than what i mentioned - there is a vterans crisis line now, that's good. no i think i covered that. something for the widow, and other filters. 

- Any questions for me? 

>no. this is good work. 

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
