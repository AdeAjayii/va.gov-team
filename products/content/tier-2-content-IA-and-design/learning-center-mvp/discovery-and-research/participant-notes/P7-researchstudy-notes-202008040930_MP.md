*Session:* 
8/4/2020
9:30 am

*Highlights:* 
* “LC” would have weight loss info, recipes. Benefits info. How to connect with other Vets who have similar problems. 
* uses MHV
* not sure about call VA 311 - ‘You’ve got too many phone numbers.”
* for change address, she would go to top box with audiences or create account
* thinks you might need a VA.gov account before you can get benefits
* there is no place at the top (header) that lets you go to your info — it lets you sign in
* put create account and sign in at top
* knew to go to Disability for Agent Orange
* from the Agent Orange LC page, she thought that clicking on the Disability or Health Care tags would give you Vietnam Vets as the audience
* on the search results for Agent Orange, she saw a search result with burn pits in the description and also the Directory of Environmental Health and said these are for more than just the Vietnam audience. 
* would go to VBA for benefits (by clicking the topic tag) or to LC homepage
* “Learning Center” is good. Or “VetScope” b/c you’re scoping out info.
* to find LC, would use top main search, type in “Learning Center” — or see if there is a link to LC
* wants community info in the LC (ex: homeless stand downs)

*Intro…*
*I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about your benefits or VA account?*
Yes. 

*What was that question about?*
> Unemployable status. Got the run around, telling me I didn’t have enuf % of benes to get it. But the law said I did. It took “a young lady who knew how to phrase stuff” to resolve. 

*What was the first step you took to get that answered?*
> Went online. 

*Did you have to take additional steps beyond that to get the answers you needed?*
> Local Vet service office. Lady there finally helped me, got paperwork thru. 

*What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?*
> Just go to see if I can find the info online b4 I bother anybody. 

> What she does: 
> VA.gov, Google search, see if anyone else has looked for the info, go to state bc usually the state mirrors what the govt does. 

*Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?*
> Last week for physical therapy appt. 

> Abt 3 mos ago had to find copy of declaration bc refinancing house. 

*Was that a typical experience for you?*
> Yes. 

*Prototype…*
   [https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4) 

*If you saw a section of VA.gov called “Learning Center”, what kinds of things would you expect to see there?*
> Weight loss, recipes for low calorie, low sugar, starch, that stuff, foods. Talking about benes. How to connect with other Vets that are having similar problems that you do.

*Imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. How would you do that?*
> Wd go on the MHV website, chg it there, send written notice to the VA itself, and also call them. 

*Task 1: General impression*

*What is this page for and what do you think you can do?*
> It’s a little bit of everything. Get ?s answered, Find out abt benes. Manage acct. 

> Like forgot password. I often need this. 

*What do you think about the different ways you can find information on this page?*
> I like it. Cd have used when VA sent me back to college. 

> Retake class, fail class, knowing claim exam ?s. Was frustrated with PTSD class. 

> Home loans. “There’s all kinds of stuff here.”

> Headstones and memorials. Each section has view all where you can get more info. 

> “I’m not sure about my call VA 311 bc you’ve got too many phone numbers.”

*Task 2: Find article on a specific topic*

*If you need to make sure the VA has your new address, what wd you do?* 
> Go into you’re a “Vet or receive VA benes.” (Left box at top.) 
> 
> And create account — might need a VA.gov acct b4 you receive VA benes. “They all kind of run together.”

*What expect if click on “show more” (looking at Veteran box on the left?*
> Maybe your personal info. There is not a place at the top that lets you go to your info,  (Pointing to top nav.) It lets you sign in. 

/Looking at search results for chg address…/
> Diff between FAQ and article is that 1 gives you info; the other is questions ppl have asked. 

> You should put create acct and sign in at top. You need to give ppl a chance to sign in. 

> I would choose the Chg address for VA benes - About. But it says for some types of benes, you may have to contact the bene program. 

> Clicked on How to chg your address. Here you have sign in to VA.gov as 1st step. So you need sign in at top. 

> Step 5 tells you how to edit address. 

*Does this page answer your question?* 
> Yes. 

*Task 4: Navigate between learning center articles*
/Participant should be on Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQs or How to change your address online article/.

*Click from this page (how to step page), then in the alert box, click on “contact the specific program.”* 
> Now she’s on Chg address for your VA benes… That should be in capitals so it stands out. It didn’t stand out.

> I saw online verification system called WAIT bc it was in all caps. 

*Task 5: Navigating between topics, and between Hub and Learning Center*
	
/Participant should still be on Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQs or How to change your address online article. /

*We’re going to shift gears now. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?*
> Looking down the page she was on, Change your address for your VA benes. Reading thru footer links. Scrolling back up.

> Next step wd be to go back to the LC. Disability. 

*Since this is a prototype, we don’t have all of that set up, so I’m going to send you a link you directly to a page.*

/Send participant link to Exposure to hazardous chemicals page in prototype/:   [https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4#/screens/424624543](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4%22%20%5Cl%20%22/screens/424624543) 

*Now again, scroll around, and take a look at this page. Please continue to think out loud - you’re doing a great job with that.*

*How does this line up with what you expected to see?*
> Sorry, I read. (She takes her time and reads through things thoroughly). Looking at blue callout box. So if you were ready to prep for the chem and bio testing, you have to go thru the Army to do that? Did not know what. 

> Referred to all the crazy shots they gave us for the Gulf War. 

> Wd be nice if they had the contaminated drinking water at Ft. McClelland, Ala on this. Post closed down bc whole post was contaminated. 

> It may fall into one of these categs. she mentioned something specific to Camp LeJeune. She knows of bases where that is true.

*Go ahead and see if you can find the information you’re looking for anywhere.*
> Clicked on Agent Orange link in page. “If it was telling the truth, I wd not have a problem with it.” But don’t think it’s accurate. 

> I went to basic in 1980 and they were spraying Agent O. I was contacted that tI need to file for it. 

/This should take participant to LC Agent Orange article./

*Okay, now imagine you wanted to take it a step further and see how you would go about getting that compensation. What would you do?*
> Clicked on Learn how to file a claim. Or cheat and go to your local VSO and get them to fill it out for you. The wording on the supplications are kind of confusing, especially if you have short term memory loss or brain damage. “It seems like it runs you around in circles.”

> Find out if you are eligible… What are they doing this for? 

> There is file a claim, found it. 

/After participant clicks Learn How to File Claim./

*And, once again, how does this page line up with what you expected to find?*
> Abt what I expected… (laughs at how long it takes VA to process claim — says that is “horse hockey”). Mine took 3 1/2 years. They said they didn’t receive it.  I had receipt from post office as proof. Took a long time. 

> It’s just not me. Some ppl are waiting 10-15 years. Fighting the system. I ended up going on a video with a judge in DC to get mine. 

*Go back to Agent O page (LC page) - how find more articles of interest to same group of readers?*
> Wd go to General eligibility diseases, Svc history. 

*Task 6: Review tag results*

/If participant is not already on LC page:/
*Can you please go back to the Agent Orange page we were just looking at?*

*Did you notice the topics and audience?* 
> (She is on the Agent Orange page for LC.)

> Yes. You can either click on Disability or health care and you can get the Vietnam Vets as the audience. It would take you to those topics. Take care of those things that are Agent Orange related or exposure related. 

*Go back to list of articles for Agent Orange.*
> Looking at the search results. If the audience is more than just Vietnam Vets, I would put them in there, too. Burn pits were not just Vietnam. She is looking at Directory of Environmental Health C_____.

> (Pointing to the tag for Vietnam Vets… ) 
> I am reading it as the only aud is Vietnam Vets even tho you’re on the Agent Orange page. But we have other Vets that relate.

*Looking at Blue Water Navy…* 
*What are the diffs between Q&A and FAQs?* 
> Both are ?s and answers. One just has  the family members in it. 

*Post-Task Interview *
*From this screen (SERP with Blue Water Navy results), talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don’t already have - education, home loan, something like that.*
> From Blue Water Navy search result, click on Hosing Assistance tag. 

*How find benefits?* 
> Probably the Veterans Benefits Admin. Or go to home > LC (in breadcrumb). Found Housing assistance and VA home loans. 

*Please talk me thru the search function, options.*
> Enter keyword. For either LC or VA.gov. 

*How is the main site search diff? There is a search option up int he nav that is for the whole thing. Have you ever used that?* 
> No. 

*How does it work differently?* 
> Think the one on top would take you to the VA.gov search. 

*If you changed it from search LC to search VA.gov, would it be different (than the top main site search)?* 
> No. 

> I think ppl will use the one in the page more than the one at the top. It stands out more. 

*We don’t know what to call the product you reviewed yet. Now that you have a better idea of the type of information that’s here, what you think of the name Learning Center?*
“LC” is good. “VetScope” bc you’re scoping out info. 

*Say you went to VA.gov today and knew we had launched this product. How would you find it on the website?*
> If I went today? “I wd prob use their little bitty tiny search.” Or check to see if there’s a link from VA.gov over to the LC.

> Italics make things stand out. After you  read for a while, everything looks the same. 

*Overall, what, if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this learning center concept as a whole?*
> “I just wish the VA wd use the money they’re putting into this program for the Veterans.” “To me, taking care of my fellow brothers and sisters is important.” 

> We always do a homeless stand down, and we can’t do one this year. Can’t go into their camps bc of COVID. 

*What do you think could be improved about what we’ve reviewed today?*
> Have a place where they can put where the homeless stand downs are. I’m in Vision 8. A lot of the homeless Vets have phones; they can go on and see where the stand downs are. Showers, haircuts, have a dentist check their teeth. 

> This wd also tell other ppl how to donate - more resources, networking. 

*Any questions for me?*
> No. Thank you. 

> VA has its own system; it’s not Zoom.
