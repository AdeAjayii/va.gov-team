# P5. Research study notes: Learning center MVP research 08/04/20, 7:00 am ET
### Intro… 
I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about your benefits or VA account?

> Participant:

What was that question about?
> Participant:

What was the first step you took to get that answered?
> Participant:

Did you have to take additional steps beyond that to get the answers you needed?
> Participant:

What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?
> Participant:
Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?
> Participant:
Was that a typical experience for you?
> Participant:
 
### Prototype... 
https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4
### Things to watch for: 
- What has happened in the past when they've tried to answer questions on our website?
- Might they have familiarity with the benefit hubs already?
- Do they default to google? Or site search? Calling someone?
- What do veterans think is in a “learning center”?
 
If you saw a section of VA.gov called "Learning Center", what kinds of things would you expect to see there?
> Participant:
Imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. How would you do that?
> Participant:

## Task 1: General impression
Things to watch for: 
- What was the participant’s initial response to the page?
- What did they say about the name "Learning center"?
- What did they say about the difference between site search and this page?
- What do you think about the different ways you can find information on this page?
> Participant:
Do you think name Learning Center makes sense for what you expected?
> Participant:
What did you notice about the search?
> Participant:
How do you think this is different from the site search in the navigation?
> Participant:
## Task 2: Find article on a specific topic - 5 minutes
Things to watch for
- Did the participant notice the search bar?
- What were the participant's comments on the Search radio buttons above the search bar?
- Do users notice or get confused between the search link in the top nav (which opens to a search box) and the in-page search with the radio buttons?
- Participant reaction to audience and topic tags and content?
- Did the participant decide to look up information on the topic by searching or scanning the page links?
 
Going back to that scenario from earlier - imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. Please show me what you would normally do and continue to think out loud as you do so.
> Participant:
Since this is a prototype, not everything will work as you might expect, but it'll be very helpful to hear and see how you'd interact with it if it were a live website.
> Participant:
Take a look at this page and tell me how you'd make sure VA has your new address. Think out loud.
> Participant:
## Task 3: Review topic results 
####Participant will be looking at the View all VA account and profile articles result screen.
Things to watch for
- Is the format of each search result helpful, or is a link farm more appropriate?
 Is the format of the topic articles results page sufficient and helpful to the participant?
- What were the participant's comments, if any, on the topic and audience tags for each result?
- Do the template labels help the user choose the most relevant article to their search?
- Scroll around, and go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here.
> Participant:
How does this line up with what you expected?
> Participant:
 
Would any of these articles help you figure out how to make sure VA had your new address?
> Participant:
Prototype has three clickable results: Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQsor How to change your address online. 
What helped you determine that article was the right one for you?
> Participant:
Great, go ahead and click and see if you can find the info you're looking for.
> Participant:
## Task 4: Navigate between learning center articles 
#### Participant should be on Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQsor How to change your address online article.

Things to watch for
- Did the participant get confused navigating between articles?
- How did the experience align with participant's expectations?
- Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here.
> Participant:
Does this page answer your question?
> Participant:
What if you thought one of the other articles you saw in the list would be better information, how would you get to that information?
> Participant: “You mean how would I go back? [yes] Let’s see”. [Scrolls up page and points to breadcrumb] I would click on ‘learning center’ [ok, go back]
Okay, and based on this article, show me what you would do next.
>Participant:
- Encourage participant to click on hotspot if they have not done so already.
- On How to change address online page, hotspot is in alert, and to related info section at bottom of page
- On Change address on file page, hotspot is in body text
- Sign in FAQs page, hotspot is in to related info section at bottom of page
 
## Task 5: Navigating between topics, and between Hub and Learning Center 
Things to watch for
- How does user expect to be able to get to unrelated topic information?
- Did the participant navigate easily between the benefit hub and learning center?
- Did the participant get confused at any point going back and forth?
- What changes did the participant notice between LC and hub?
- Participant should still be on Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQsor How to change your address online article. 

We're going to shift gears now. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?
> Participant: [says to herself] “benefits address to change to?”.... [scrolls around, doesn’t seem to find] you said to add something to your benefits? scrolls, well I guess you’d go back to the learning center and get to a different topic. I don’t see how you would get to it from here. [uses breadcrumb and scrolls down to find links] “to me, you’d go over here to disabilities”.
Since this is a prototype, we don't have all of that set up, so I'm going to send you a link you directly to a page.
Send participant link to Exposure to hazardous chemicals page in prototype: https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4#/screens/424624543

Now again, scroll around, and take a look at this page. Please continue to think out loud - you're doing a great job with that.

How does this line up with what you expected to see?
> Participant:  [p clicks link in chat window] [Invision page loads slowly-user on chrome on windows] scrolls down page reading “I still don’t see… I understand that on this website they are breaking things down, if it applies to your situation then these are the things that qualify for benefits…and that’s what I’m seeing here. Like if you were in this war and you were subjected to agent orange or asbestos, then these things do qualify for benefits... like with myself when I went to Iraq, whatever I came back with that I think applied to that situation, or even after the fact, if something came back, I think I would just fill out, I think it was Form 4187 I would fill out and just submit it to disability office to get the paperwork started so that I could get tested and you know, be seen by a physician. I mean this is a great website for especially older Veterans who aren’t maybe computer savvy, or don’t know what they really qualify for, it is a good website because it breaks down a bunch of things that they could possibly receive benefits for. You know conditions that affect them. It’s good information in that way but I don’t see if it tells them what to do after that, unless I’m missing something. Oh, then it says to call that number. ” 
Go ahead and see if you can find the information you're looking for anywhere.
[M: what would be your next step]
> Participant: [Finds agent orange link]  “Click on Agent Orange”
This should take participant to LC Agent Orange article. 
Now, how does this line up with what you expected?
> Participant: Tried to click to on a + sign next to “Can I still file a claim if my illness isn’t a presumptive disease?”, this is very informative, once you did click on the particular illness
Based on this information, what would you do next?
> Participant:
 
If participant doesn't want to click Learn How to File a claim button:

Okay, now imagine you wanted to take it a step further and see how you would go about getting that compensation. What would you do?
> Participant: Well you’d have to submit the paperwork first, you have to assess that with the information that was given that was on that first page, then this second page goes into more detail about you really being able to determine if this qualifies you, after you submit the paperwork you’re going to have to have an appointment…because, I kind of don't understand the question, that, YOU don’t personally don't determine if you qualify. You meet some criteria but the VA will ultimately make that assumption once you’d had that doctor’s appointment.  
[if you wanted the VA to make that assumption here next step?] 
> Participant: to file a claim, submit paperwork from your physician, then they go from there. 
After participant clicks Learn How to File Claim.
[participant directed to click the button] participant first tries to click “File a VA disability claim” 
And, once again, how does this page line up with what you expected to find?
> Participant: [reads] “I didn't know people actually still did anything in person! [laughs to herself] I’m sorry, that kind of tickled me. I didn’t file my claim in person. Everything I do, I do online. 
[reiterates if page meets expectations] I still don’t see where it says...Oh [sees “Can I file my claim online?” but skips past the green button then notices the form link under ‘By mail’] Oh there’s that form.  Where is it that you click on to go online? Did I already bypass it? I don’t see one. [expects a ‘do it online’ button] Otherwise, I know you can fill out the paperwork, it’s always been this way, you can print, but who’d want to do that? 
 
## Task 6: Review tag results 
Things to watch for
- Did the participant realize the topic and audience tags were clickable? If not, why not?
- What did they think the tags would do?
- Are the tag results useful?
- Is the format helpful to the participant?
 
If participant is not already on LC page:
Can you please go back to the Agent Orange page we were just looking at? 
From here, show me how would you find more articles that might be of interest to the same group of readers.
> Participant: [reads links under ‘On this page’] “service history requirements would also be important to know. You would need to know at what particular time that disease was going on”
If participant doesn't click on audience tag.
Did you notice the audience and topic labels?
> Participant: Yeah, the Vietnam vet disabilities? 
[Had you noticed them previously?] 
> Yeah I saw them when I first clicked on this page. And I realize too that the Vietnam War Veterans are the ones who would have had contact with agent orange, however, that doesn’t stop people from trying to see if they qualify, I don’t want to make it seem like people are trying to defraud, but I’m just saying some people really don’t know sometimes what they could possibly have been exposed to.
What would you expect to happen if you clicked on one?
> Participant: For vietnam war vets, issues that reflect someone who had been in the Vietnam war, for disabilities that gives you information about all the disabilities, healthcare would take you to the healthcare screen where you can make appointments, contact your physician
Did you think they were clickable?
> Participant: Yeah
Go ahead and click on the audience label.
 
User lands on Learning center articles tagged: Vietnam War Veterans page.
Take a look at this page. How does it align with what you'd expect?
> Participant: “Wow I didn’t know they had this “free comprehensive health exams” 
Even though I know the VA keeps trying to make the website more user friendly it's still unfortunate that... people of that era, they still are not getting that information because they are not on the computer, I just know that because I know some people of that age, my mother’s new husband , I’ve had to help him with the whole ‘I’m stuck’…because he won’t get on the computer… it’s unfortunate…But at least it does have the information for those of us who will go in there and try to find it for them. This does make it more accessible. I didn't realize they offered a free health screening. 
 
What do you think about how this information is presented?
 
 
If participant doesn't comment on tags:
Are there any aspects to the page that you think are interactive?
> Participant:
 
What would you expect if you click on one of the audience or topic tags?
> Participant:
 
Did you notice any articles that sound like they could be the same?
> Participant:
 
What differences do you notice between them?
> Participant: tries to give the Veteran as much information as possible for them to find out
 
Post-Task Interview 
From this screen, talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don't already have - education, home loan, something like that.
> Participant: [scrolls up and down] for any benefit? [for home loan] from right here? the Veterans Benefit Administration page [uses topic link] Because the way you go to the benefits page, the “Blue waters” link isn’t going to get you to benefits
 
From what you've seen today, can you describe how the learning center is different from overall site search?
> Participant: [had you noticed?] Yes. You would just type in what you are looking for..  It’s not different just another way to 
 
If they didn't address the radio buttons above the search bar, get their perspective on that.
> Participant: [user didn’t understand the term search bar, goes to VA search link in global nav. Is directed to search bar] 
[M Reiterates question] well you would just type in whatever it is you were looking for
[M: If selected search VA.gov what would happen? Do you see those two options?] Oh, what about it? more information [doesn’t seem to understand] I dunno, you’re confusing me, I think they are sort of the same thing, The learning center is within VA.gov, unless I’m wrong? Va.gov. This IS VA.gov. The learning center IS just a portion of VA.gov. If you searched VA.gov you were searching the home screen or am I not correct. Or is the learning center a whole other thing by itself?  [is it confusing?] Yeah. Because I noticed those two but I never even thought of it that way, when you asked me, it confused me. 
[Thinks this search is the same as search in global nav]
 
We don't know what to call the product you reviewed yet. Now that you have a better idea of the type of information that's here, what you think of the name Learning Center?
> Participant: I think that’s perfect, trying to find something special? Otherwise you make it confusing, just call it what it is.
 
Say you went to VA.gov today and knew we had launched this product. How would you find it on the website?
> Participant: If I know what it was called I’d type it into learning center, if I didn’t know, I would type, I wouldn’t know necessarily that there was a thing called “learning center”, if I did I would type it in the search engine
 
Overall, what, if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this learning center concept as a whole?
> Participant: I don’t think there’s anything in there that’s not helpful. It’s a good thing to have in there…Again for alot of people, the level of information and how to move through a computer is limited. As much information as you have to make it easier for some people who this would benefit. For some people they would think, I don’t need all that, they would just type in the search what they’re looking for. They can just go to whatever. For some people this would be helpful. I don’t necessarily feel like I’m one of them. Like I said, there have only been a couple times that I’ve had to call because whatever I did didn’t work for me. For me, I just keep clicking around til I find what I’m looking for.
 
What do you think could be improved about what we've reviewed today?
> Participant: No, once gets launched, and I’m sure this is what you all are going to do anyway, you know pretty much just like anything else, um [that] people are given this information, like mailed to us or at the VA, like in a pamphlet that says this is how you get to this website to be able to all this information you need, then people are going to be successful at it. Otherwise, if they don’t know it’s there, then they are not going to be able to use it and it's not going to benefit anybody.
 
Any questions for me?
