12 pm

*Intro…*
*I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about your benefits or VA account?*
> All the time. All my brothers and sisters. We can never get anything accurate. And info online we see is 3-4 mos behind. 

> Call 800 number; tired of scripted responses. “eBenes is the most horrible thing on the face of this earth.” B4 they merged VA.gov and eBenes, VA.gov was much better. 

> eBenes was better, easier to navigate b4 the merge with VA.gov. 

*What was that question about?*
> We just get blanket statements, generalities. Useless. No accurate, finite answers. They’re forcing us all to conform to this little square… They don’t care about us.” 

> I have PTSD, MSD - very difficult. 

*What was the first step you took to get that answered?*
> 800 number. Call backs only happen if it’s in a certain window. 

> That’s been going on for more than 3 decades. 

*Did you have to take additional steps beyond that to get the answers you needed?*
Xxxxx

*What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?*
> Not good. Can’t get answers. 

*Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?*
> Checking on the status of my appeal. Got a letter saying my appeal was on the docket in DC. 

*Was that a typical experience for you?*
> Yes, See ^
> 
She keeps expressing frustration with the VA. 

*Prototype…*
   [https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4](https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4) 

*If you saw a section of VA.gov called “Learning Center”, what kinds of things would you expect to see there?*
> Easy instructions as far as navigating. 1-2 clicks to get somewhere. 

*What kind of content wd be there?* 
> Easy access to pay history. Finance. Status in real time of our appeals, claims recently filed. Those are the 2 big ones. Third one is ppl who need health aids. Aid and attendants, clothing allowance. For my bros and sisters. Easy access. So you can apply. 

*Imagine you recently moved and you need to make sure VA has your new address. How would you do that?*
> Right now I have to go thru eBenes and go to hospital facility separately and also to Mental Access (?). I have to go to 3 different areas to chg my info. 

> “It would be nice if all the VA facilities were on the same system; however, they are /not/.”

> VA sent all my paperwork to Highland Park, IL, not to Minneapolis. So my personal info is out there. And I can’t do anything. 

*Task 1: General impression*

*What is this page for? What can you do here?*
> Women Vets — that’s great. Fiduciaries is huge thing. Families, caregivers. 

> Career and employment counselors…

> Lenders and real estate pros is great. 

> We can’t access the code for 2FA. 

> Should have explanation after Vets Legacy Program. 

> For check status, is that real time, or is that the lag time with eBenes?

> Educ and training. 

> “This is not half bad. Not half bad at all. 

*Do you think name Learning Center makes sense for what you expected?*
> > For Vets, you need to drive us toward the LC. I wd not automatically go there to find answers. I wd think, “What kind of baloney is in this? How will this answer my question?”

> I wd not bother to go to “LC.”

> Call it “Veteran Assistance.”

*Task 2: Find article on a specific topic*

*Take a look at this page and tell me how you’d make sure VA has your new address. Think out loud.*
> Easily go to search results for profile and acct. What is the diff between Chg your address for VA benes and How to chg your address online? One is About and one is Step by Step.

> Why aren’t both of these ^ under one? “You are sending us more places than we need to go.” “This would reduce frustration and anxiety.”

> With traumatic brain injury (TBI) , you must make it only 1-2 steps. Otherwise we will say, “Screw it.”

> Give us 1 option and put the Step by Step under it. So there is 1 place to go.

*Task 3: Review topic results*
/Participant will be looking at the View all VA account and profile articles result screen./

*Scroll around, and go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here.*
> See ^

*Would any of these articles help you figure out how to make sure VA had your new address?*
> So confusing that there are 2 options (see above). She clicked on Chg address for VA benefits. I don’t remember my password. Why do I need to sign in a 2nd time? (She thinks she is already signed in.) 

> When I go to eBenes or VA.gov, they ask me to sign in. I should not have to sign in a 2nd time. 

> Looking at Voc Rehab — “that’s a freaking nightmare.”

> “Everything it telling us to sign in again… It makes no sense to me.” She sees multiple buttons on the page that say sign in. 

*If you were not signed in, would the page answer your question?* 
> It appears that it is trying to redirect me. So I wd walk away. “I’m done already.”

*Click on How to chg your address online. How does this line up with your expectations?*
> Streamline to the absolute most basic. Streamline it to where a 5th grader could fill it out quickly. 

> “Right now the Tucson VA looks like a prison and they treat us like inmates.” 

*You are referring to COVID?* 
> Yes. 

> Something else that would be very helpful would be how to get a service animal. I have a new 5-month-old service puppy. He has to deal with my nightmares, anxiety. When I was looking for a new one, I cd find nothing. “They need to step the h#$% up.” I have a prescription from my VA psychiatrist. 

*Task 5: Navigating between topics, and between Hub and Learning Center*
	
/Participant should still be on Change your address on file w/ the VA, Sign in FAQsor How to change your address online article. /

*We’re going to shift gears now. Imagine you need to find out how to get compensation for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?*
> Would search where it says “Search VA.gov” (in the page). 

*So you wd chg the button to “Search VA.gov”?*
> Yes.  I would not think to change it from “Search LC” off the bat. 

< technical problems showing the Exposure to hazardous chems page, so facilitator shared her screen >

> Looking at the left nav - upset that PTSD is under Exposure to hazardous materials (it is a sibling on the left nav, under Eligibility). 

Looking at Agent Orange Elig page…
> This is not telling me where I need to go, what I need to produce? 

> Water Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force got exposed to Agent Orange. All the branches, not just Army, were exposed. This just gives you basic info on what is considered by the VA. But I don’t know where to go. 

Clicked on Agent Orange section >> Went to Agent Orange LC page. 
*Please look at the tags under the page name.* 
> Topics not as important as the link, the assistance I need to file. 

> Why don’t you keep all this together? Under Agent Orange, put everything that is Agent Orange. Under Gulf War, put everything Gulf War. Like I said about the dog, just need 1-2 words. If I have to go to another page to get more info, “it’s almost like a red herring.”

> “3 clicks in, I’m done.”

*Do you think Topic and Audience links are clickable?* 
> I was kind of hoping, yeah. That’s what I expected. If you cd make it look more visually like a link, wd make it easier. 

*Post-Task Interview *
*From this screen, talk me through how you would apply for a benefit you don’t already have - education, home loan, something like that.*
> Wd go down to where it says file a claim. No, I wd back out to main page and look for file claim. Maybe just type in the search bar. 

*We don’t know what to call the product you reviewed yet. Now that you have a better idea of the type of information that’s here, what you think of the name Learning Center?*
“LC” - I wouldn’t even bother. 

*Overall, what, if anything, do you find valuable or not helpful about this learning center concept as a whole?*
> As long as it’s streamlined, it would be nice. I get frustrated easily. “It appears that the VA is trying to make it more difficult for us. The more they frustrate us, they more we just say ‘screw it’ bc we don’t want to do their Fantasy Island thing.”

*What do you think could be improved about what we’ve reviewed today?*
> She recommends: 
* Use words we recognize. 
* 1-2 clicks
* Service dogs, veterinary bills
* Wording of a 5-6th grader
* Streamline, simplify 

> “The more we have to do, the less we’re going to do.” It affects our mental health. I am in the medical industry, so I can talk from both sides of the fence.
