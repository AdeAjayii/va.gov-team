## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.  We have a team working on a new section of VA.gov that will help you find answers to questions about VA benefits and services, and your VA.gov account.  Today, I'd like to hear about your experience getting questions answered, and go through a prototype of this new section to learn how useful it is to you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30-45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, I want to hear your honest opinions.** I'm not testing your ability, and there are no right or wrong answers. Our team wants to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your honest feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** It may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **I'd like to I record my screen and audio as we talk today, if that's alright with you.** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable with me recording screen and audio for our session?
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I've started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. Can you remember a time you had a question about you benefits or VA account? 
- What was that question about? 
- What was the first step you took to get that answered? 
- Did you have to take additional steps beyond that to get the answers you needed?
- What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?
- Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?
- Was that a typical experience for you?
- Okay, thanks for sharing that. One more thing before we start getting into the prototype - if you saw a section of VA.gov called "Learning Center", what kinds of things would you expect to see there?

### Things to watch for

- What has happened in the past when they've tried to answer questions on our website?  

- Might they have familiarity with the benefit hubs already?

- Do they default to google? Or site search?  Calling someone?  

- What do veterans think is in a “learning center”?

  

## First Task: Find article on a specific topic - 5 minutes

- Imagine you recently moved and you need to change the address the VA has on file.  Talk me through how you'd find information on how to do that.  

- Okay, thank you for explaining that to me.  Now I'm going to have you share your screen, and then I'll send you a link to a prototype so we can look at that together. I'd like to see how you'd find information on how to change your address with this prototype.

  *Talk user through screen sharing so they can share their screen.*

- It'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible moving forward.  Since this is a prototype, not everything will work as you might expect, but it'll be very helpful to hear and see how you'd interact with it if it were a live website.

  *Use chat to send user link to prototype, starting on home page of learning center.* https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/YJXZTKC6CN4

- Take a look at this page, and tell me how you'd get info on changing the address on file here. Think out loud. 

  *`View all VA account and profile articles` link is a clickable hotspot*

  *Allow participant to go through entire page before prompting them to click.*

- *If participant doesn't comment, ask:*

  - Did you notice the radio buttons above the search bar? Explain what you think would happen if you searched with one over the other.
  - How do you think this is different from the site search in the navigation?
  - What are your impressions of the different categories of audience and topics? 
  - Would that be useful to you?

- *If participant doesn't find hotspot:* 

  - Have you noticed any place you can click? No problem - see the `View all VA Account and profile articles` link? Go ahead and click that.

### Things to watch for

- Does the initial response line up with behavior described in the warm up?
- Did the participant notice the search bar?
- What were the participant's comments on the `Search` radio buttons above the search bar?
- Do users get confused between the search link in the top nav (which opens to a search box) and the in-page search with the radio buttons?
- Participant reaction to audience and topic tags and content?
- How did the participant decide to look up information on the topic?

## Second Task: Review topic results - 3 minutes

*Participant will be looking at the `View all VA account and profile articles` result screen.*

- Ok great! Now again, scroll around, and go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here. 

- How does this line up with what you expected?

- Tell me which of these items would be the most helpful for you, if you needed to figure out how to change your address on file.

  *Two clickable results: `Change your address on file w/ the VA`, or `How to change your address online`*

- *If the participant hasn't commented*: What are your thoughts on the visual format of the search results?

- Great, you can click now and see if you can find the information you need.

### Things to watch for

- Is the format of each search result helpful, or is a link farm more appropriate?
- Is the format of the topic articles results page sufficient and helpful to the participant?
- What were the participant's comments, if any, on the topic and audience tags for each result?
- Do the template labels help the user choose the most relevant article to their search?

## Third Task: Navigate between learning center articles and topics - 5 minutes

*Participant should be on `Change your address on file w/ the VA`, or `How to change your address online` article*

*Article should have CTAs leading to other related articles*

- Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here. 

- How useful is this page in answering your question?

- See if you can find additional information on this topic.

  *Encourage participant to click on hotspot if they have not done so already*. 

- *Once on new page:*

  - How does this line up with what you expected?
  - Excellent, you're being really helpful. Thank you. Just a few more things to go over.

- We're going to shift gears now. Imagine you need to find out how to file a disability claim for a Veteran who has been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?

  *May need to remind user that things might not work as expected since this is a prototype*

### Things to watch for

- Did the participant get confused navigating between articles?
- How did the experience align with participant's expectations?
- How does user expect to be able to get to unrelated topic information?

## Fourth Task: Navigating between Hub and Learning Center - 5 minutes

- Thanks for sharing that. Since this is a prototype, we don't have all of that set up, so I'm going to take you directly to a page we think would be helpful a helpful starting point. 

  *Send participant link to Agent Orange page in prototype*: https://vsateams.invisionapp.com/share/URY28M6KJP7

- Now again, scroll around, and take a look at this page. Please continue to think out loud - you're doing a great job with that.

- How does this line up with what you expected to see? Okay, that's good to know. Go ahead and see if you can find the information you're looking for anywhere.

  *This should take participant to LC Agent Orange page*

- Now, how does this line up with what you expected?

- Go ahead and see if you can find that information on how to file a claim.

  *This should hopefully get participant to click CTA, and land on another hub page*

- And, once again, how does this page line up with what you expected to find? 

### Things to watch for

- Did the participant navigate easily between the benefit hub and learning center?
- Did the participant get confused at any point going back and forth?
- What changes did the participant notice between LC and hub?

## Fifth Task: Review tag results -  2 minutes

- Great, thank you! We're almost done.  One more thing I'd like to get your feedback on. Can you please go back to the Agent Orange page we were just looking at? You can use your back button.

- From here, show me how would you find more information for Vietnam War Veterans.

  *Encourage participant to click on audience tag if they don't on their own*. *Ask if they noticed the audience and topic tags, and if they knew they were clickable.*

- How does this align with what you'd expect? 

- How useful would this be to you?

### Things to watch for

- Did the participant realize the topic and audience tags were clickable?
- If not, why not?
- Are the tag results useful?
- Is the format helpful to the participant?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Excellent, this has all been so helpful. Just a few more questions for you before we wrap up.  From this screen, talk me through how you would find an application for a benefit you don't already have - education, home loan, something like that.
- From your perspective, is the learning center different from overall site search?
- If they didn't address the radio buttons above the search bar, get their perspective on that
- Our session today was focused on the learning center we are developing. Now that you have a better idea of the kinds of content within, what you think of the name ` Learning Center`?
- Where would you expect to have access to something like that on the website?
- Overall, what do you find valuable about this learning center concept as a whole?
- What do you think could be improved about the concept we've reviewed today?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
