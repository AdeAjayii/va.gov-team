## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.  We have a team working on a new section of VA.gov that will help you find answers to questions you might have about VA benefits and services, and your VA.gov account.  Today we're going to talk about your experience getting questions answered and go through a prototype of this new section to learn how useful it is to you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 MINUTES.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** It may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I've started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. When you have questions about your benefits or your VA account, what's the first step you take in trying to get that answered?

- If you don't get the information you need, what do you do next?

- What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?

- Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?

- Was that a typical experience for you?

  

### Things to watch for

- What has happened in the past when they've tried to answer questions on our website?  

- Might they have familiarity with the benefit hubs already?

- Do they default to google? Or site search?  Calling someone?  

  

## First Task: Find article on a specific topic - X minutes

- Imagine you are looking for information on [VA account topic].  Talk me through how you'd find the answer.  

- Okay, thank you for explaining that to me.  Now I'm going to have you share your screen, and then I'll send you a link to a prototype so we can look at that together. It'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible moving forward.  Since this is a prototype, not everything will work as you might expect, but it'll be very helpful to hear and see how you'd interact with it if it were a live website.

  *Talk user through screen sharing so they can share their screen.*

  *Use chat to send user link to prototype, starting on home page of learning center.*

- Take a look at this page, and tell me how you'd find that information here. Think out loud. You can scroll and but don't click on anything just yet.

  *Allow participant to go through entire page before prompting them to click.*

- Ok, great.  Now go ahead and try to find that [VA account topic] information the way you normally would, click around.

  *Search bar and `View all VA account and profile articles` links are hotspots*

- Enter search term or click on link

### Things to watch for:

- Does the initial response line up with behavior described in the warm up?
- Did the participant notice the search bar?
- Participant reaction to audience and topic tags and content?
- Did the participant comment on the `Search` radio buttons above the search bar?
- How did participant decide to look up information on the topic?

## Second Task: Review results - X minutes

*Participant will either be looking at a search results screen, or a `View all [topic] articles` result screen.*

*By end of this task, participant should review 3 search results screens: keyword, all topic articles, and tag results*

- Ok great! Now again, scroll around, but don't click yet. Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here. 

  - How does this line up with what you expected?
  - What would you click on from here? Why?

- That's helpful, thanks for sharing that.  Now let's go back to the last screen you were on and try finding the  [VA account topic] info a different way. Do you see another way you can do that?

  *Allow participant to explore. If they don't find the 2nd method (whatever they didn't choose the first time) on their own, guide them to search or click `View all [topic] articles` link*

- Ok great! Now again, scroll around, but don't click yet. Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here. 

  - How does this line up with what you expected?
  - What would you click on from here? Why?

- Excellent, thank you. Now let's say you from here, you decided to switch gears and wanted to see everything about **XYZ**. Talk me through how you would do that.

  *Guide participant to click on tag if they don't mention it on their own*

  **^^^** **NEED TO WRITE THIS PROMPT BASED ON WHAT WE WANT TO TEST WITH TOPIC OR AUDIENCE TAGS**. 

- Ok great! Now again, scroll around, but don't click yet. Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here. 

  - How does this line up with what you expected?

### Things to watch for:

- Is it easy for them to navigate this search-focused, tag-based structure?
- Is the format of each search result helpful, or is a link farm more appropriate?
- Does the participant find any of the results pages more helpful than the other?
- Is the format of the topic articles results page sufficient and helpful to the participant?
- What were the participants comments on the topic and audience tags for each result?
- How did they react to the tag navigation?

## Third Task: Navigating between Benefit hub and Learning Center - X minutes

*Participant should be on a tag results page*

- Now imagine you want to **TASK THAT WILL TAKE THEM BACK AND FORTH**. Show me how you would do that from here.

  *Participant will ultimately go to hub page*

-  Now again, scroll around, but don't click yet. How does this line up with what you expected?

- Go ahead and click **REPHRASE TO FOCUS ON TASK COMPLETION PATH WITHOUT LEADING**

  *This should take participant to LC page*

-  Now on this page, scroll around, but don't click yet. How does this line up with what you expected?

- Do you see a way you can **COMPLETE TASK**? Go ahead and do so

  *This should take participant to back to another hub page*

- Click on CTA, go back to relevant hub page (not the same one we started on).  Does that confuse people?

  **ARE WE UNNECESSARILY BOUNCING PEOPLE AROUND IN THIS TASK?**

### Things to watch for:

- Do the template labels help the user choose the most relevant article to their search?

- Did the participant get confused when they landed in the benefit hub from the learning center?

- Did the participant get confused when they landed in the learning center from the benefit hub?

- Do users get confused if they don't find something in the benefit hub and they have to go to the learning center?

  

## Fourth Task: Navigate between learning center articles - X minutes

*Participant should be on an article page*

- You've been so helpful with all this feedback, thank you. I just have a few more things I want to ask you about.
- Talk me through how you would find additional information on this particular topic from here.
- And then, let's imagine you want to shift gears again, and look up some information on **UNRELATED TOPIC**. How would you do that?

### Things to watch for:

- How does user expect to be able to get to related topic information?
- How does user expect to be able to get to unrelated topic information?

## Fifth Task: Search for hub content in learning center - X minutes

- Now, let's go back to the screen where we started.  Imagine you want to find information about **SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN LEARNING CENTER**. Talk me through how you would find that from here.

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant understand that information they don't find in the learning center might be in the benefit hub?

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Our session today was focused on the learning center we're developing. Where would you expect to have access to something like that on the website?
- Tell me how you see the learning center different from overall site search.
- If they didn't address the radio buttons above the search bar, get their perspective on that
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
