## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.  We have a team working on a new section of VA.gov that will help you find answers to questions you might have about VA benefits and services, and your VA.gov account.  Today we're going to talk about your experience getting questions answered and go through a prototype of this new section to learn how useful it is to you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 MINUTES.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** It may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I've started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?
- Was that a typical experience for you?
- When you have questions about your benefits or your VA account, what's the first step you take in trying to get that answered?
- If you don't get the information you need, what do you do next?
- What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?

### Things to watch for

- Do they default to google? Or site search?  Calling someone?  
- What has happened in the past when they've tried to answer questions on our website?  
- Might they have familiarity with the benefit hubs already?

## First Task: Find article on a specific topic - X minutes

- Imagine you are looking for information on [VA account topic].  Talk me through how you'd find the answer.
  - *Allow user to respond. Would they start w/ google? Go to VA.gov? Call someone?*
  - *Post link in chat*
- Okay, great. I'm going to send you a link to our prototype. Imagine you're starting on the home page of this learning center. Don't click on anything yet, but you can scroll, and talk me through how you'd find that information from here.
- 

### Things to watch for:

- Does the initial response line up with behavior described in the warm up?

- Did the participant notice  the search bar?

- Did the participant comment on the `Search` radio buttons above the search bar?

  

## Second Task: Review search results - X minutes

- Talk me through what you see here, what do you think you can do there? How does this line up with what you expected?
- What do you expect would happen if you clicked on one of the tags next to topic or audience? Go ahead and click on it

### Things to watch for:

- Do the template labels help the user choose the most relevant article to their search?
- Is the format of each search result helpful, or is a link farm more appropriate?
- [Etc]

## Third Task: Benefit hub vs Learning center - X minutes

- Start on a hub page, look for information that isn't there, get reaction on having to find it in the learning center.  
- Take user to an article in the learning center with a CTA that goes back to the hub.
- Click on CTA, go back to relevant hub page (not the same one we started on).  Does that confuse people?

### Things to watch for:

- Do users get confused if they don't find something in the benefit hub and they have to go to the learning center?
- Do users get confused if they click on a content link or CTA button in the learning center and it takes them to a benefit hub page? And vice versa? 
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

## Fourth Task: Search for hub content in learning center - X minutes

- Search for something in the learning center that doesn't exist
- Ask user to speak to where they'd expect to find that  

### Things to watch for:

- Do users understand that information they don't find in the learning center might be in the benefit hub?
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Our session today was focused on the learning center we're developing. Where would you expect to have access to something like that on the website?
- Tell me how you see the learning center different from overall site search?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
