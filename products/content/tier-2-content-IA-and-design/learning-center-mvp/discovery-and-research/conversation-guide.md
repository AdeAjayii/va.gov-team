## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.  We have a team working on a new section of VA.gov that will help you find answers to questions you might have about VA benefits and services, and your VA.gov account.  Today we're going to talk about your experience getting questions answered and go through a prototype of this new section to learn how useful it is to you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30-45 MINUTES.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** It may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I've started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- I understand you have benefits with the VA or an online account with the VA. When you have questions about your benefits or your VA account, what's the first step you take in trying to get that answered?

- If you don't get the information you need, what do you do next?

- What has your experience been like trying to answer those questions on VA.gov?

- Tell me about the last time you visited a VA website. What were you doing?

- Was that a typical experience for you?

  

### Things to watch for

- What has happened in the past when they've tried to answer questions on our website?  

- Might they have familiarity with the benefit hubs already?

- Do they default to google? Or site search?  Calling someone?  

  

## First Task: Find article on a specific topic - 5 minutes

- Imagine you recently moved and you need to change the address the VA has on file.  Talk me through how you'd find the answer.  

  ***Note: will have them talk through it rather than start on VA.gov and show us, so we don't prime them if using VA.gov is not the way they'd typically change their address***

- Okay, thank you for explaining that to me.  Now I'm going to have you share your screen, and then I'll send you a link to a prototype so we can look at that together. It'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible moving forward.  Since this is a prototype, not everything will work as you might expect, but it'll be very helpful to hear and see how you'd interact with it if it were a live website.

  *Talk user through screen sharing so they can share their screen.*

  *Use chat to send user link to prototype, starting on home page of learning center.*

- Take a look at this page, and tell me how you'd find that information here. Think out loud. You can scroll and but don't click on anything just yet.

  *Allow participant to go through entire page before prompting them to click.*

  *`View all VA account and profile articles` link is a clickable hotspot*

- Ok, great.  Now go ahead and click that link.

#### Things to watch for

- Does the initial response line up with behavior described in the warm up?
- Did the participant notice the search bar?
- What were the participant's comments on the `Search` radio buttons above the search bar?
- Participant reaction to audience and topic tags and content?
- How did participant decide to look up information on the topic?

#### Notes for planning

- Confirm task scenario: "change your address the VA has on file"
- Screen needs
  - Learning center homepage

## Second Task: Review topic results - 3 minutes

*Participant will be looking at the `View all VA account and profile articles` result screen.*

- Ok great! Now again, scroll around, but don't click yet. Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here. 

- How does this line up with what you expected?

- What would you click on from here? 

  *Two clickable results: `Change your address on file w/ the VA`, or `How to change your address online`*

- Great, go ahead and click.

#### Things to watch for

- Is the format of each search result helpful, or is a link farm more appropriate?
- Is the format of the topic articles results page sufficient and helpful to the participant?
- What were the participant's comments, if any, on the topic and audience tags for each result?
- Do the template labels help the user choose the most relevant article to their search?

#### Notes for planning

- Screen needs
  - `View all VA account and profile articles` page with 10 search results
  - Page should include some results that have similar titles so we can see if the template labels are effective in helping users choose a relevant search result

## Third Task: Navigate between learning center articles and topics - 5 minutes

*Participant should be on `Change your address on file w/ the VA`, or `How to change your address online` article*

*Article should have CTAs leading to other related articles*

- Go ahead and talk me through what you see on this page and what you can do here. 

- How useful is this page in answering your question?

- Show me how you would find additional information on this particular topic from here. It's okay to click now if you want.

  ***Note: need to refine how to prompt user to click to go to the another related article***

  *Encourage participant to click on hotspot if they have not done so already*

- How does this line up with what you expected?

- Excellent, you're being really helpful. Thank you. Just a few more things to go over.

- Let's shift gears and think about some non-account things. Imagine you need to find out what benefits someone qualifies for if they've been exposed to Agent Orange. How would you do that from here?

  *May need to remind user that things might not work as expected since this is a prototype*

#### Things to watch for

- Did the participant get confused navigating between articles?
- How did the experience align with participant's expectations?
- How does user expect to be able to get to unrelated topic information?

#### Notes for planning

- Need to refine how to prompt user to go between related articles. Do we frame the task so that it's broad, then the first clickable item still doesn't answer the question, so they have to click on one of the other links?
- Need to refine prompt shifting user to Agent Orange content. Does it need to be more specific?
- Last prompt can elicit how a user would navigate from one learning center topic to another topic
- Screen needs:
  - Change your address on file with VA
  - How to change your address online
  - Sign in FAQs 

## Fourth Task: Navigating between Hub and Learning Center - 5 minutes

- Thanks for sharing that. Since this is a prototype, we don't have all of that set up, so I'm going to take you directly to a page we think would be helpful in finding that information. 

  *Send participant link to Agent Orange page in prototype*

- Now again, scroll around, but don't click yet. How does this line up with what you expected?

- Okay, that's good to know. Go ahead and see if you can find the information you're looking for anywhere.

  *This should take participant to LC Agent Orange page*

- Now, how does this line up with what you expected?

- Show me what you would do to take this a step further and start the process of getting these benefits.

  *This should hopefully get participant to click CTA, and land on another hub page*

#### Things to watch for

- Did the participant get confused when they landed in the learning center from the benefit hub?
- Did the participant get confused when they landed in the benefit hub from the learning center?
- What changes did the participant notice between LC and hub?

#### Notes for planning

- Screen needs:
  - Exposure to hazardous materials page from benefit hub
  - Agent Orange LC page w/ CTAs leading back to hub, with Vietnam War Veterans (to tee up next task)
  - How to file or apply page from benefit hub

## Fifth Task: Review tag results -  2 minutes

- Great, thank you! We're almost done.  One more thing I'd like to get your feedback on. Can you please go back to the Agent Orange page we were just looking at? You can use your back button.

- From here, show me how would you find more information for Vietnam War Veterans.

  *Encourage participant to click on audience tag if they don't on their own*

- How does this align with what you'd expect? 

- How useful would this be to you?

#### Things to watch for

- Are the tag results useful?
- Is the format helpful to the participant?

#### Notes for planning

- Screen needs:
  - Vietnam War Veterans search results page

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Excellent, this has all been so helpful. Just a few more questions for you before we wrap up.  From this screen, talk me through how you would an application for a benefit you don't already have - education, home loan, something like that.
- Our session today was focused on the learning center we are developing. Where would you expect to have access to something like that on the website?
- Tell me how you see the learning center different from overall site search.
- If they didn't address the radio buttons above the search bar, get their perspective on that
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
