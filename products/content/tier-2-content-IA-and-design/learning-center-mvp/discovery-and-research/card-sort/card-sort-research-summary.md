# Research Summary for Learning Center Topics and Audience Tags Card Sort

DRAFT

## Background

[Card sort research plan for Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-plan-veterans.md)

[Card sort research plan for SMEs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-plan-sme.md)

This card sort was conducted to evaluate the nomenclature for the learning center audience and topic labels, and see how those labels are applied to articles by: 

- Subject matter experts (SME) or people who create/manage content for Veterans, and 
- Veterans

 We felt a card sort would supplement [our usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/usability-study-research-plan.md) by helping us to answer the following:

- Does each audience/topic label make sense to participants?
- How do participants assign the primary audience and topic labels to articles?
- Have we missed, or mis-labeled, any significant audiences or topics?
- Do they understand the labels in expected or unexpected ways?

## Methods

### Conducting the card sort

We conducted a hybrid card sort via [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com). An hybrid card sort asks participants to sort a list of items into provided categories, or create and name a category if one of the provided categories doesn't feel right. 

Participants completed 2 different card sorts: one to evaluate audience labels, and one to evaluate topic labels.  Both groups received the same cards and categories for topics.  We wanted to test some non-Veteran audience labels with SMEs, so we created a separate sort for Veterans and SMEs to test audience labels.

- The audience card sort for Veterans contained 13 cards and 9 categories.
- The audience card sort for SMEs contained 21 cards and 14 categories
- The topic card sort for both participant groups contained 16 cards and 6 categories. 

- The studies were open from August 31 - September 14. We had originally planned to close both on September 11, but extended the time due to the Labor Day holiday.

### Participants

We used Perigean to recruit Veteran participants, and our team's product owner emailed a link to the card sort for SME participants. 

- 39 Veterans of 47 Veterans completed the topic card sort
- 39 of 42 Veterans completed the audience card sort
- 9 of 10 SMEs completed the topic card sort
- 9 of 9 SMEs completed the audience card sort

### How we evaluated the studies

Each card sort was evaluated individually. We first looked at how people mapped cards to categories compared to what we expected them to do.  Then, we dug into areas of lower agreement to evaluate:

- Where else did people put the cards we thought would go into a particular category?
- What unexpected cards did people put into a category?

Once the individual studies were evaluated, we looked for trends across both audience groups to identify any significant findings that apply to our beneficiary and SME users.

The studies don't give us a holistic view of how people will understand the nomenclature once both topics *and* audience labels are applied. It's likely that having both labels on a single article will help someone understand the purpose of the content.

## Key findings across both participant groups

1. We can confidently move forward with the majority of audience labels we've proposed; there are two adjustments to consider. [Details](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-summary.md#we-can-confidently-move-forward-with-the-majority-of-audience-labels-weve-proposed-there-are-two-adjustments-to-consider)
2. A secondary audience label may help surface content to all applicable audiences.

3. The list of audience labels we've come up with matches the mental model of Veteran and SME participants.

#### Details

---

#### 1. We can confidently move forward with the majority of audience labels we've proposed; there are two adjustments to consider.

Across both participant groups, people mapped the majority of articles the way we expected. This validates that we're on the right track with the nomenclature we've selected, and don't need to make changes to most of the audience labels.

We should consider revising the audience label ``Veterans 65+ with complex care needs``. This had a low rate of agreement compared to other labels.  People put articles we expected to go here under other labels, demonstrating a broader scope of thinking about those articles.  People also put articles into this group that applied to only one part of the label ("65+" or "complex care") such as `What is a protected pension?` . This suggests that simplifying the label may make its intention more clear to both content authors and Veterans. 

We should also consider adding a label for non-citizen Veterans. This is the only audience category participants created (for the article `Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals`). We should evaluate if we have enough content to warrant creating a category for this audience group.

**Recommendations**

- Move forward with the majority of labels as proposed.
- Consider revising the audience label ``Veterans 65+ with complex care needs``. 
- Consider adding a label for non-citizen Veterans

#### 2. A secondary audience label may help surface content to all applicable audiences.

Participants put articles into categories we didn't expect about 20% of the time in both groups.   `All Veterans` and `Family members and caregivers` stood out has having the widest variety of articles added to them.  Often times, the associations made sense, such as `What is adult day care` being mapped by many participants to `Family members and caregivers`.  Many of these instances seemed to be related to the a word in the article title being repeated in the audience label.

This suggests there is need to surface content by audience in more than one way.  We may want to consider adding audience labels to our [learning center categories](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/template-requirements.md#learning-center-categories), or allowing for a second front-end audience tag, to help surface content to all applicable audiences.

**Recommendation**

Consider ways we can apply multiple audience labels to articles. An additional front-end tag or adding audiences to learning center categories could be helpful.

#### 3. The list of audience labels we've come up with matches the mental model of Veteran and SME participants.

5 new categories were created in the SME card sort, and 8 were created in the Veteran card sort. All but one were topics, rather than audiences, which tells us that generally we have a comprehensive list of audiences to cover a range of topics.  The audience topic created was related to Veterans with non-citizen status. 

The SME card sort had the addition of non-beneficiary audience labels, and they generally understood how to apply those to articles ([detailed below](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-summary.md#sme-participants-generally-understood-how-to-apply-the-non-beneficiary-audience-labels)).

**Recommendation**

Move forward with the majority of audience labels as proposed.

## Audience label card sort details

### Veteran participants

This table outlines the audiences we expected Veteran participants to associate with each article, and the number of people who did what we expected:

|      | Audience (category)                      | Article (card)                                               | Number of participants who agreed (out of 39) |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | All veterans                             | How do I verify my school enrollment?                        | 32                                            |
| 2    | All veterans                             | What is a “protected” pension?                               | 31                                            |
| 3    | All veterans                             | How do I reset my password?                                  | 35                                            |
| 4    | Family members and caregivers            | Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran | 23                                            |
| 5    | Gulf War Veterans                        | Presumptive Gulf War diseases                                | 37                                            |
| 6    | Incarcerated Veterans                    | VA services for Veterans in prison or who are about to be released | 39                                            |
| 7    | LGBTQ Veterans                           | What VA family member benefits are my same-sex spouse eligible for? | 34                                            |
| 8    | Minority Veterans                        | Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals | 32                                            |
| 9    | Native American Veterans                 | Which tribal governments participate in VA’s NADL home loan program? | 37                                            |
| 10   | Women Veterans                           | Can I get mammogram screenings at VA?                        | 37                                            |
| 11   | Women Veterans                           | VA services for women Veterans experiencing homelessness     | 38                                            |
| 12   | Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs | What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer?         | 17                                            |
| 13   | Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs | What is adult day care?                                      | 17                                            |

#### Veteran participants mapped the majority of articles to audience labels the way we expected.

31 (79%) or more people mapped 10 of the 13 articles mapped to our proposed audience label. The audience labels Incarcerated Veterans, Women Veterans, and Native American Veterans had the highest rate of agreement.

##### **Takeaway**

The mental model of participants aligns with what we expected for the most part. We should feel confident moving forward with the labels that had a high agreement rate.

#### The audience label `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` had the lowest rate of agreement.

Only 17 participants matched the articles we expected with that audience label.  The remaining participants placed these articles under less expected audience labels.  The placement isn't wrong, but it suggests that Veterans think more broadly about these topics.

People placed the article `What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer?` under:

- Family members and caregivers (11)
- All Veterans (9)
- LGBTQ Veterans (2)

People placed the article `What is adult day care?` under:

- Family members and caregivers (20)
- All Veterans (2)

The other articles people placed into this category suggest they focused on the 65+ or the complex care part of the label, rather than putting it all together:

- What is a “protected” pension? (5)
- Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran (3)
- Presumptive Gulf War diseases (1)
- What VA family member benefits are my same-sex spouse eligible for? (1)

##### **Takeaways**

- Veterans think more broadly about the topics we felt fit into this audience group. 
- We should consider adding audience labels to learning center categories, or allow for multiple audience front-end labels, to support this broader scope of thinking, help surface content to all applicable audiences.
- Simplifying the label  `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` may make it easier for all Veterans to find relevant articles with this label.

#### The `Family members and caregivers` audience label also performed lower than most other audience categories. 

23 of 39 (59%) participants matched this audience label to the article we expected (`Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran`).  The remaining participants matched this article to audiences that were both broader and more specific than what we expected:

- All Veterans (11)
- Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs (3)
- Gulf War Veterans (1)
- Claims (1, this was a participant created category)

The `Family members and caregivers` audience label had these articles matched to it. These suggest that Veterans thought about this label in terms of *their own* family members (dependents), or perhaps from the perspective of "Veteran as a caregiver":

- What is adult day care? (20)
- What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer? (11)
- What VA family member benefits are my same-sex spouse eligible for? (3)
- How do I verify my school enrollment? (2)
- What is a “protected” pension? (2)

##### **Takeaway**

- The majority of participants mapped this audience as we expected, so we should feel confident moving forward with it as-is.
- A secondary audience front-end tag or category could help clarify exactly what an article is about, and avoid misinterpretation.

#### We may want to add a label for Veterans of non-citizen nationality.

In this hybrid card sort, people had the ability to create their own categories if those we provided didn't make sense. The majority of categories people created for this study were topics, rather than an audience. There was one exception: 2 participants created a category for the article `Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals`:

- Non-US Citizen Veterans Information
- Non-US national Veterans

The nomenclature participants used isn't quite correct, but the creation of these categories shows that 2 people saw this as separate from minority Veterans (our suggested audience), and that there is awareness about the difference in citizenship status for this audience.

##### **Takeaway**

We should consider a separate audience group for content that applies to U.S. nationals, or Veterans of non-citizen nationality.

### SME / content author participants

This table outlines the audiences we expected SME participants to associate with each article, and the number of participants who did what we expected:

|      | Audience (category)                                          | Article (card)                                               | Number of participants who agreed (out of 9) |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | All veterans                                                 | How do I verify my school enrollment?                        | 4                                            |
| 2    | All veterans                                                 | What is a “protected” pension?                               | 3                                            |
| 3    | All veterans                                                 | How do I reset my password?                                  | 6                                            |

#### SME participants mapped the majority of articles to audience labels the way we expected.

7 (78%) or more people mapped 13 of the 21 articles mapped to our proposed audience label. The audience labels `Gulf War Veterans`, `Women Veterans`, and `Veteran service organizations and accredited representatives` had 100% agreement.

8 of 9 participants agreed with our proposed mapping for `Lenders, appraisers, and other real estate professionals`, `Funeral directors and cemeteries`, `Schools, administrators, and other education professionals`, `Native American Veterans` and `LGBTQ Veterans`. 

##### **Takeaway**

The mental model of participants aligns with what we expected for the most part. We should feel confident moving forward with the labels that had a high agreement rate.

#### SME participants generally understood how to apply the non-beneficiary audience labels.

6 of the 14 audience tags we tested are intended to be applied to articles with a non-Veteran, non-beneficiary audience in mind.  All of those labels were mapped to the article we expected by 6 or more participants.  The `Fiduciaries` label had the lowest rate of agreement among this group.  One article we thought people would put in this category was titled, `How do I become a fiduciary for my Veteran friend or family member?`  3 participants mapped it to the `Family members and caregivers` audience group, likely because of the phrase "family member" in the article title.

##### **Takeaways**

- This data suggests that SMEs generally understand the difference between articles for beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. 
- The ability to add more than one audience tag or category could help content authors target the right audience when their content applies to multiple groups.

#### SME participants applied some Veteran audience labels more broadly than we expected.

The `All Veterans` audience label had the most cards (9 of 21) added to it across all the categories. It's meaningful that content authors would associate an article with such a broad label, especially when more specific and relevant options are available. All 3 of the cards we expected to make it into this category were placed there by at least 33% of participants, but people also added things like: 

- Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran (2)
- Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals (2)

The `Family members and caregivers` audience label also had a variety of cards added to it that we expected to be placed in other categories, such as:

- What is adult day care? (5)
- How do I become a fiduciary for my Veteran friend or family member? (3)
- What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer? (2)

##### **Takeaways**

- SMEs applied the `All Veterans` audience label more broadly than we hoped, considering more specific categories were available.  
- We should help content authors and SMEs understand the benefit of using a more specific audience label when applicable. When people apply `All Veterans` to something related to pension or education, it suggests they're defaulting to the safest option possible without considering whether or not a more specific label would reach the target audience.
- Again, the ability to add more than one audience category or front-end tag could help content authors when their content applies to multiple audience groups. The grouping we saw isn't necessarily wrong.

#### SME participants didn't map articles to  `Veterans 65+ with complex care needs` exactly how we anticipated.

The majority of SME participants mapped one article like we thought they would: `What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer?` was placed into this category by 6 of 9 people. The category had 2 other noteworthy results:

1. Only 33% associated `What is adult day care?` with this audience group.  The rest of the participants put that article into `Family members and caregivers`, which tells us that they thought about this article from the perspective of the caretaker, and not necessarily the Veteran.  This is similar to the results we saw from Veteran participants.

- 5 of 9 participants placed `What is a protected pension?` into this category.  This is something we suspected might happen, and suggests that people might not be taking the `complex care needs` portion of this audience label into consideration.

**Takeaways**

- People generally understood this label, but also had broader associations (e.g. adult day care with a family caregiver) that caused them to place an article in a place we didn't expect.
- Simplifying the label  `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` may make it easier for SME's to use this audience label more specifically as it applies to the content they're working with.  Because it has two parts, people may apply it as-is to content that isn't exactly relevant to this audience label.



## Topic label card sort details

Both audiences received the same cards and categories; this table outlines the topics we expected  participants to associate with each article, and the number of participants who did what we expected:

### Veteran Participants

#### Generally, Veterans mapped articles to topics the way we expected about half of the time.

7 of the 16 articles were mapped to topics the way we expected by 20 (51%) or more people. The agreement rate varied from 21-92% across the articles, with an average of 52% overall.   `Housing assistance and home loans` was the only topic where all the articles were mapped as expected by the majority of participants. As a topic category, `Careers and employment` had the lowest rate of agreement.  Since this was not the case in our SME topic card sort, we suspect this is due to participants not being familiar with the VSOC acronym.

In most cases, the unexpected associations people made were logical, and seemed to be a result of either:

1.  The article relating to multiple topics (e.g. many participants associated `Where can I view my VA payments online?`  to `VA account and profile`).  It's natural that the primary topic would vary based on an individuals perspective.
2. A person didn't understand something in the article itself. For example,`How to prepare for your Agent Orange Registry Health Exam` would be challenging to associate to `Disability` if you weren't familiar with Agent Orange. 

**Takeaway**

- With many of our key data points near 50%, the data doesn't conclusively support any changes one way or the other.
- This validates that our plan to apply multiple topic tags and categories to articles will help surface content for Veterans with a variety of mental models.

#### There was a high association between `claims` and `disability`; 2 participants created a category called `Claims`.

The majority of participants mapped articles with the word `claim` in it to the `Disability` category, instead of the topic we identified as being primary.   This suggests that Veterans think about claims in the context of disability benefits, even though other VA benefits have claims.

- 22 participants mapped `How do I check my claim status?` to `Disability`  instead of `VA account and profile`
- 19 participants mapped `How to challenge a claims agent fee` to `Disability` instead of `Other topics and questions`

2 participants created their own category called `Claims` to group the same claim-related articles.

**Takeaway**

- Many Veterans don't associate checking their claim status with their VA account.
- This validates the need for cross-tagging/categorization to surface content appropriately in the learning center.

- `Disability` should be considered as a tag for disability claim related information, even if the content of the article directs a person to a part of the website other than the Disability benefit hub.

#### Veterans associated `Records` and  `VA account and profile` with a wide variety of content.

15 of the 16 cards were added to `Records` by at least one participant, and 13 of the 16 cards were added to `VA account and profile`. Our team had assigned 3 articles to each of these topics, so this tells us that Veterans have a much broader mental model around these categories than we thought. 

2 or more Veterans mapped the following unexpected articles to `Records` , which suggest that they're thinking about records in the sense of 

**Records**

- How to upload evidence online for your claim (5)
- How to change your VA address online (5)
- Who do I contact about debt on my account? (4)
- VA HCRV specialists for Veterans who are or have been in prison (4)
- How VA back pay (retroactive benefits) works (4)
- How to challenge a claims agent fee (3)
- I lost my phone and I can’t access the code for 2-factor authentication (2)
- Directory of state Veterans agencies (2)
- How do I check my claim status? (2)

#### The cards sorted into `Other topics and questions` suggest that participants saw this topic as a "catch all" for things they weren't sure about.



#### 

### SME Participants

#### SME participants mapped the majority of articles to topic labels the way we expected.

5 (56%) or more people mapped 10 of the 16 articles mapped to our proposed topic label. `Housing assistance and home loans` had the highest level of agreement at 94%, but no topic had 100% agreement with our mapping.



##### **Takeaway**

The mental model of participants aligns with what we expected for the most part. We should feel confident moving forward with the labels that had a high agreement rate.

#### 

## Next Steps

1. Incorporate insights gained from this card sort into the nomenclature for the learning center. 
2. Monitor how these labels are applied by content authors once the learning center is launched.
3. Evaluate how these labels resonate with Veterans in upcoming research studies.
4. Are there metrics we can use
