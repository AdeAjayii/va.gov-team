# Research Summary for Learning Center Topics and Audience Tags Card Sort

DRAFT

## Background

[Card sort research plan for Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-plan-veterans.md)

[Card sort research plan for SMEs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-plan-sme.md)

This card sort was conducted to evaluate the nomenclature for the Learning Center audience and topic labels, and see how those labels are applied to articles by 

- Subject matter experts (SME) or people who create/manage content for Veterans, and 
- Veterans

 We felt a card sort would supplement [our usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/usability-study-research-plan.md) by helping us to answer the following:

- Does each audience/topic label make sense to participants?
- How do participants assign the primary audience and topic labels to articles?
- Have we missed, or mis-labeled, any significant audiences or topics?
- Do they understand the labels in expected or unexpected ways?

## Methods

### Conducting the card sort

We conducted a hybrid card sort via [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com). An hybrid card sort asks participants to sort a list of items into provided categories, or create and name a category if one of the provided categories doesn't feel right. 

Participants completed 2 different card sorts: one to evaluate audience labels, and one to evaluate topic labels.  Both groups received the same cards and categories for topics.  We wanted to test some non-Veteran audience labels with SMEs, so we created a separate sort for Veterans and SMEs to test audience labels.

- The audience card sort for Veterans contained 13 cards and 9 categories.
- The audience card sort for SMEs contained 21 cards and 14 categories
- The topic card sort for both participant groups contained 16 cards and 6 categories. 

- The studies were open from August 31 - September 14. We had originally planned to close both on September 11, but extended the time due to the Labor Day holiday.

### Participants

We used Perigean to recruit Veteran participants, and our team's product owner emailed a link to the card sort for SME participants. 

- 39 Veterans of 47 Veterans completed the topic card sort
- 39 of 42 Veterans completed the audience card sort
- 9 of 10 SMEs completed the topic card sort
- 9 of 9 SMEs completed the audience card sort

## Findings

### How we evaluated the studies

Each card sort was evaluated individually. We first looked at how people mapped cards to categories compared to what we expected them to do.  Then, we dug into areas of lower agreement to evaluate:

- Where else did people put the cards we thought would go into a particular category?
- What unexpected cards did people put into a category?

Once the individual studies were evaluated, we looked for trends across both audience groups to identify any significant findings that apply to our beneficiary and SME users.

### Audience label card sort

#### Veteran participants

This table outlines the audiences we expected Veteran participants to associate with each article, and the number of people who did what we expected:

|      | Audience (category)                      | Article (card)                                               | Number of participants who agreed (out of 39) |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | All veterans                             | How do I verify my school enrollment?                        | 32                                            |
| 2    | All veterans                             | What is a “protected” pension?                               | 31                                            |
| 3    | All veterans                             | How do I reset my password?                                  | 35                                            |
| 4    | Family members and caregivers            | Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran | 23                                            |
| 5    | Gulf War Veterans                        | Presumptive Gulf War diseases                                | 37                                            |
| 6    | Incarcerated Veterans                    | VA services for Veterans in prison or who are about to be released | 39                                            |
| 7    | LGBTQ Veterans                           | What VA family member benefits are my same-sex spouse eligible for? | 34                                            |
| 8    | Minority Veterans                        | Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals | 32                                            |
| 9    | Native American Veterans                 | Which tribal governments participate in VA’s NADL home loan program? | 37                                            |
| 10   | Women Veterans                           | Can I get mammogram screenings at VA?                        | 37                                            |
| 11   | Women Veterans                           | VA services for women Veterans experiencing homelessness     | 38                                            |
| 12   | Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs | What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer?         | 17                                            |
| 13   | Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs | What is adult day care?                                      | 17                                            |

#### Veteran participants mapped the majority of articles to audience labels the way we expected.

31 (79%) or more people mapped 10 of the 13 articles mapped to our proposed audience label. The audience labels Incarcerated Veterans, Women Veterans, and Native American Veterans had the highest rate of agreement.

**Takeaway**

The mental model of participants aligns with what we expected for the most part. We should feel confident moving forward with the labels that had a high agreement rate.

#### The audience label `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` had the lowest rate of agreement.

Only 17 participants matched the articles we expected with that audience label.  The remaining participants placed these articles under less expected audience labels.  The placement isn't wrong, but it suggests that Veterans think more broadly about these topics.

People placed the article `What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer?` under:

- Family members and caregivers (11)
- All Veterans (9)
- LGBTQ Veterans (2)

People placed the article `What is adult day care?` under:

- Family members and caregivers 20)
- All Veterans (2)

The other articles people placed into this category suggest they focused on the 65+ or the complex care part of the label, rather than putting it all together:

- What is a “protected” pension? (5)
- Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran (3)
- Presumptive Gulf War diseases (1)
- What VA family member benefits are my same-sex spouse eligible for? (1)

**Takeaways**

- Veterans think more broadly about the topics we felt fit into this audience group. 
- Our plan to allow authors to apply more than one audience tag supports this broader scope of thinking, and should help people find the information they're looking for.
- Simplifying the label  `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` may make it easier for all Veterans to find relevant articles with this label.

#### The `Family members and caregivers` audience label also performed lower than most other audience categories. 

23 of 39 (59%) participants matched this audience label to the article we expected (`Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran`).  The remaining participants matched this article to audiences that were both broader and more specific than what we expected:

- All Veterans (11)
- Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs (3)
- Gulf War Veterans (1)
- Claims (1, this was a participant created category)

The `Family members and caregivers` audience label had these articles matched to it. These suggest that Veterans thought about this label in terms of *their own* family members (dependents), or perhaps from the perspective of "Veteran as a caregiver":

- What is adult day care? (20)
- What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer? (11)
- What VA family member benefits are my same-sex spouse eligible for? (3)
- How do I verify my school enrollment? (2)
- What is a “protected” pension? (2)

**Takeaway**

-  The majority of participants mapped this audience as we expected, so we should feel confident moving forward with it as-is.
- A secondary audience label should help clarify exactly what the article is about, and avoid misinterpretation.

#### We may want to add a label for Veterans of non-citizen nationality.

In this hybrid card sort, people had the ability to create their own categories if those we provided didn't make sense. The majority of categories people created for this study were topics, rather than an audience. There was one exception: 2 participants created a category for the article `Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals`:

- Non-US Citizen Veterans Information
- Non-US national Veterans

The nomenclature participants used isn't quite correct, but the creation of these categories shows that 2 people saw this as separate from minority Veterans (our suggested audience), and that there is awareness about the difference in citizenship status for this audience.

**Takeaway**

We should consider a separate audience group for content that applies to U.S. nationals, or Veterans of non-citizen nationality.

### SME / content author participants

This table outlines the audiences we expected SME participants to associate with each article, and the number of participants who did what we expected:

|      | Audience (category)                                          | Article (card)                                               | Number of participants who agreed (out of 9) |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | All veterans                                                 | How do I verify my school enrollment?                        | 4                                            |
| 2    | All veterans                                                 | What is a “protected” pension?                               | 3                                            |
| 3    | All veterans                                                 | How do I reset my password?                                  | 6                                            |

| 7    | Minority Veterans                                            | Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals | 6                                            |

| 15   | Fiduciaries                                                  | How do I become a fiduciary for my Veteran friend or family member? | 6                                            |

#### SME participants mapped the majority of articles to audience labels the way we expected.

7 (78%) or more people mapped 13 of the 21 articles mapped to our proposed audience label. The audience labels `Gulf War Veterans`, `Women Veterans`, and `Veteran service organizations and accredited representatives` had 100% agreement.

8 of 9 participants agreed with our proposed mapping for `Lenders, appraisers, and other real estate professionals`, `Funeral directors and cemeteries`, `Schools, administrators, and other education professionals`, `Native American Veterans` and `LGBTQ Veterans`. 

**Takeaway**

The mental model of participants aligns with what we expected for the most part. We should feel confident moving forward with the labels that had a high agreement rate.

#### The majority of SME participants understood how to apply the non-beneficiary audience labels.

6 of the 14 audience tags we tested are intended to be applied to articles with a non-Veteran, non-beneficiary audience in mind.  All of those labels were mapped to the article we expected by 6 or more participants.  The `Fiduciaries` label had the lowest rate of agreement among this group.  One article we thought people would put in this category was titled, `How do I become a fiduciary for my Veteran friend or family member?`  3 participants mapped it to the `Family members and caregivers` audience group, likely because of the phrase "family member" in the article title.

**Takeaways**

- This data suggests that SMEs generally understand the difference between articles for beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. 
- The ability to add more than one audience label should help content authors target the right audience when their content applies to multiple groups.

#### Participants applied the  `All Veterans` label to more articles than we expected.

This audience label had the most cards (9 of 21) added to it across all the categories. Only one card we thought would be added to this category was mapped here by the majority of people: `How do I reset my password?`.  Unexpected cards added to this category were:

- Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran (2)
- Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals (2)
- List of education liaisons for schools and state approving agencies (1)
- VA subsidies and other incentives for businesses to hire Veterans (1)
- What is a VA appointed fiduciary responsible for? (1)
- What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer? (1)

This category had the most cards in the Veteran card sort as well. It makes sense, from the Veteran perspective, to associate something you may not be confident about with the broadest label. It's more meaningful that content authors would associate an article with such a broad label, especially when more specific and relevant options are available.

**Takeaways**

- Participants thought about this audience label more broadly than we intended.  
- We should help content authors and SMEs understand the benefit of using a more specific audience label when applicable. When people apply `All Veterans` to something related to pension or education, it suggests they're defaulting to the safest option possible without considering whether or not a more specific label would reach the target audience.

#### 

### What does the combined data suggest?

#### We can confidently move forward with the majority of audience labels we've proposed.

In both participant groups, people mapped the majority of articles the way we expected them to. This validates that we're on the right track with the nomenclature we've selected, and don't need to make changes to most of the audience labels.

#### Participants in both studies mapped more articles than we expected to the `All Veterans` audience label.

In both studies, this category had the most cards; it's not surprising that people would put a card here if they weren't sure where else it belonged.  It's



## Next Steps

1. Incorporate insights gained from this card sort into the personalization 2.0 strategy and design.
2. When we have a more defined/proposed IA, test that IA again via either a closed card sort or tree testing.
