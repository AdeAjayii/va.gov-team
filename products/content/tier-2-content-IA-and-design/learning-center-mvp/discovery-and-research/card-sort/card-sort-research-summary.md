# Research Summary for Learning Center Topics and Audience Tags Card Sort

DRAFT

# Background

[Card sort research plan for Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-plan-veterans.md)

[Card sort research plan for SMEs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-plan-sme.md)

This card sort was conducted to evaluate the nomenclature for the Learning Center audience and topic labels, and see how those labels are applied to articles by 

- Subject matter experts (SME) or people who create/manage content for Veterans, and 
- Veterans

 We felt a card sort would supplement [our usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/usability-study-research-plan.md) by helping us to answer the following:

- Does each audience/topic label make sense to participants?
- How do participants assign the primary audience and topic labels to articles?
- Have we missed, or mis-labeled, any significant audiences or topics?
- Do they understand the labels in expected or unexpected ways?

# Methods

## Conducting the card sort

We conducted a hybrid card sort via [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com). An hybrid card sort asks participants to sort a list of items into provided categories, or create and name a category if one of the provided categories doesn't feel right. 

Participants completed 2 different card sorts: one to evaluate audience labels, and one to evaluate topic labels.  Both groups received the same cards and categories for topics.  We wanted to test some non-Veteran audience labels with SMEs, so we created a separate sort for Veterans and SMEs to test audience labels.

- The topic card sort contained 16 cards and 6 categories. 
- The audience card sort for Veterans contained 13 cards and 9 categories.
- The audience card sort for SMEs contained 21 cards and 14 categories

- We used Perigean to recruit Veteran participants, and DEPO emailed a link to the card sort for SME participants.  The studies were open from August 31 - September 14.

## Participants

39 Veterans and 9 SMEs participated in the card sort. 

We didn't collect demographic data for this study, but did ask Perigean to ensure all participants were Veterans, and that we were inclusive of people who identified as having cognitive impairments, and with disabilities. 

- 15% of Veteran participants identified as having a cognitive impairment
- 23% of Veteran participants completed the study on a mobile device
