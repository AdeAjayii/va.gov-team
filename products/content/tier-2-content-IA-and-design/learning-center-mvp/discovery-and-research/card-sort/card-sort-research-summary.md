# Research Summary for Learning Center Topics and Audience Tags Card Sort

DRAFT

# Background

[Card sort research plan for Veterans](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-plan-veterans.md)

[Card sort research plan for SMEs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-plan-sme.md)

This card sort was conducted to evaluate the nomenclature for the Learning Center audience and topic labels, and see how those labels are applied to articles by 

- Subject matter experts (SME) or people who create/manage content for Veterans, and 
- Veterans

 We felt a card sort would supplement [our usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/usability-study-research-plan.md) by helping us to answer the following:

- Does each audience/topic label make sense to participants?
- How do participants assign the primary audience and topic labels to articles?
- Have we missed, or mis-labeled, any significant audiences or topics?
- Do they understand the labels in expected or unexpected ways?

# Methods

## Conducting the card sort

We conducted a hybrid card sort via [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com). An hybrid card sort asks participants to sort a list of items into provided categories, or create and name a category if one of the provided categories doesn't feel right. 

Participants completed 2 different card sorts: one to evaluate audience labels, and one to evaluate topic labels.  Both groups received the same cards and categories for topics.  We wanted to test some non-Veteran audience labels with SMEs, so we created a separate sort for Veterans and SMEs to test audience labels.

- The topic card sort contained 16 cards and 6 categories. 
- The audience card sort for Veterans contained 13 cards and 9 categories.
- The audience card sort for SMEs contained 21 cards and 14 categories

- We used Perigean to recruit Veteran participants, and DEPO emailed a link to the card sort for SME participants.  The studies were open from August 31 - September 14.

## Participants

39 Veterans and 9 SMEs participated in the card sort. 

We didn't collect demographic data for this study, but did ask Perigean to ensure all participants were Veterans, and that we were inclusive of people who identified as having cognitive impairments, and with disabilities. 

- 15% of Veteran participants identified as having a cognitive impairment
- 23% of Veteran participants completed the study on a mobile device

## How we evaluated the card sort

To complete once synthesis is futher along.

## Audience labels

### Veteran participants

This table outlines the audiences we expected people to associate with each article, and the number of people who did what we expected:

| | Audience (category)                      | Article (card)                                               | Number of participants who agreed (out of 39) |
|-| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
|1 | All veterans                             | How do I verify my school enrollment?                        | 32                                            |
|2| All veterans                             | What is a “protected” pension?                               | 31                                            |

|8| Minority Veterans                        | Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals | 32                                            |
|9| Native American Veterans                 | Which tribal governments participate in VA’s NADL home loan program? | 37                                            |

|13| Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs | What is adult day care?                                      | 17                                            |

#### Participants mapped the majority of articles to audience labels the way we expected.

31 (79%) or more people mapped 10 of the 13 articles mapped to our proposed audience label. The audience labels Incarcerated Veterans, Women Veterans, and Native American Veterans had the highest rate of agreement.

**Takeaways**

The mental model of participants aligns with what we expected for the most part. We should feel confident moving forward with the labels that had a high agreement rate.

#### The audience label `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` had the lowest rate of agreement.

Only 17 participants matched the articles we expected with that audience label.  The remaining participants placed these articles under less expected audience labels.  The placement isn't wrong, but it suggests that Veterans think more broadly about these topics.

People placed the article `What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer?` under:

- Family members and caregivers (11)
- All Veterans (9)
- LGBTQ Veterans (2)

People placed the article `What is adult day care?` under:

- Family members and caregivers 20)
- All Veterans (2)

The other articles people placed into this category suggest they focused on the 65+ or the complex care part of the label, rather than putting it all together:

- What is a “protected” pension? (5)
- Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran (3)
- Presumptive Gulf War diseases (1)
- What VA family member benefits are my same-sex spouse eligible for? (1)

**Takeaways**

- Veterans think more broadly about the topics we felt fit into this audience group. 
- Our plan to allow authors to apply more than one audience tag supports this broader scope of thinking, and should help people find the information they're looking for.
- Simplifying the label  `Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs` may make it easier for all Veterans to find relevant articles with this label.

#### The `Family members and caregivers` audience label also performed lower than most other audience categories. 

23 of 39 (59%) participants matched this audience label to the article we expected (`Forms for filing a life insurance claim for your deceased Veteran`).  The remaining participants matched this article to audiences that were both broader and more specific than what we expected:

- All Veterans (11)
- Veterans age 65+ with complex care needs (3)
- Gulf War Veterans (1)
- Claims (1, this was a participant created category)

The `Family members and caregivers` audience label had these articles matched to it. These suggest that Veterans thought about this label in terms of *their own* family members (dependents), or perhaps from the perspective of "Veteran as a caregiver":

- What is adult day care? (20)
- What kinds of long-term care services does VA offer? (11)
- What VA family member benefits are my same-sex spouse eligible for? (3)
- How do I verify my school enrollment? (2)
- What is a “protected” pension? (2)

**Takeaway**

-  The majority of participants mapped this audience as we expected, so we should feel confident moving forward with it as-is.
- A secondary audience label should help clarify exactly what the article is about, and avoid misinterpretation.

#### We may want to add a label for Veterans of non-citizen nationality.

In this hybrid card sort, people had the ability to create their own categories if those we provided didn't make sense. The majority of categories people created for this study were topics, rather than an audience. There was one exception: 2 participants created a category for the article `Benefits and services for Veterans who are Philippine U.S. nationals`:

- Non-US Citizen Veterans Information
- Non-US national Veterans

The nomenclature participants used isn't quite correct, but the creation of these categories shows that 2 people saw this as separate from minority Veterans (our suggested audience), and that there is awareness about the difference in citizenship status for this audience.

**Takeaway**

We should consider a separate audience group for content that applies to U.S. nationals, or Veterans of non-citizen nationality.
