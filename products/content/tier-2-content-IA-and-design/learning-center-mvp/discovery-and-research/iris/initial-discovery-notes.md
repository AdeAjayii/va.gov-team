# IRIS call center intro 

NEED TO CLEAN UP

- Chante's Role 
  - is the DEPO liaison for call centers, that's her 100% focus
  - Stakeholder for ThoughtWorks
  - Can get us in touch with contact center authors to do our study
  - We need to touch base on how many contact centers there are
- Each line of business has their own contact centers: VBA, VHA, Crisis Line (may be part of VHA). There may be multiple call centers but we don't know - do they each have their own content teams? Is there a central contact team for all of their content centers?
- To interview all those contact center content teams. We don't need to talk to the call reps, we want to talk to the content teams that support the call centers.
- Purpose of the ethnographic study: we want them to use the CMS to publish learning center content for Veterans instead of what they currently use today.  We don't know what they use today, except based on what Chante told us a few weeks ago:  
  - They use two things to publish articles. Articles is used to publish external customer articles
  - They also use eGains to publish internal docs, like scripts for call center reps
  - **We are not 100% sure on IRIS vs eGaines or how they re used. "Black hole"**
  - Now that IRIS is going to be retired, VEO is in the process of getting the content teams onboarded into this tool called eGaines to publish *all* content.  
  - They're planning on publishing this content on know.va.gov - a public website primarily currently used by VA employees and contractors such as contract claims processors. This is where those people who can't access the intranet can access things like manuals about processing claims.
  - We can't stop them, they are going to do this. We don't want to send Veterans here.
  - We're kind of doing a ask questions answer and apologize later type of strategy where we are migrating all of the public facing IRIS content into the learning center. And as we publish that public facing content, we're going to tell the Stakeholder (business people)- hey, retire that content on this know.va.gov because it's now published and available in the learning center on VA.gov. and they will, have done it already with other content.
  - The part that impacts us for this author research is we want to know what the content authors experience currently is of writing and publishing IRIS content through IRIS so we can better understand their current process and work to make sure that we're addressing some of the requirements that they need in Drupal. Because we want them to actually publish content.
  - Chris, Jen, Chante have talked - we are creating duplication and we're okay with this because we want to retire content on know.va.gov. 
  - Content authors will have to create content in two places until they agree to only use Drupal. Ultimately we hope they'll be able to manage all of their content with a Drupal integration.
  - Our goals
    - What is your current authoring experience like, end to end?  
    - Even before the beginning point - how do you determine what content needs to be created? Is it just based on call center requests? 
    - Collaboration with the business stakeholders? 
    - Vetting process - who approves, verifies, reviews?
    - What kind of content management life cycle process do they have? Do they audit older articles? How do they know when something becomes outdated and it becomes outdated or retired? Do they rely on business stakeholders? Is it random?
    - Beth has discovered in her IRIS audit that a lot of content is wrong. 
    - Part of needing to know what their current authoring experience is to kind of suss out what their requirements are as part of the authoring experience?: is it important to know who the content author was. How do they use that information? If info is identified as being wrong, is someone graded on that content ? Does it go back to that person to fix? What are the data things that are created as part of their authoring experience that is used for processes that they may have: grading, traceability. 
    - We may discover that we need to stand up a centralized LC content team that is different from these other content teams. If it looks like they have no processes in place, no governance. If the things that Beth is discovering with her audit turns out to be true at the end of this whole migration process (that a lot of content is just wrong) - DEPO might say, because this is public facing, we can't have that and we're going to take it over. There's no point in having a learning center if people publish bad/wrong information.
    - The reason why I suggest an ethnographic study - is because in the past when Chante and I have reached out to a few of the content team members, Regina Yant and others, we've been able to get them on the phone and extract some answers but the answers were always very not concrete and when we need more information from them, it's been a complete failure.
    - If we do it as an async we send you questions, it goes nowhere. Even being on the phone w/ them, and asking them questions has gotten us nowhere. The people we've spoken with who are representative of the content authors don't know enough to answer the questions concretely. Regina is a manager and she just doesn't know the specific things we want answers.
    - Meg Peters suggested get an author on the phone and have them do a screen share and do the task and we watch them and record them, and then maybe we have a separate session where we actually interview them.  So we have a record of what they actually do, and maybe we can interview them about what they're doing. 
    - Also because the multiple content teams have different processes 
    - As part of the synthesis it would be great to have a user journey map of the content authors, and again, it might be that if we interview 4 content team members, they have slightly different journeys. Or drastically different journeys.
    - This may be part of or different, but a content lifecycle map - how do they currently manage the full life cycle of an article.  How do they decide what content is needed, all the way to how do they manage the lifecycle. When do they know they need to update information, retire, etc.
    - 

- SO many call centers at VA, she's our only central point person for dealing with all the numerous call centers

- With the retirement of IRIS, she has also been leading as the stakeholder (not the PM) for the ThoughtWorks team that is working on creating the web form.  
  - There's a really horrible webform that IRIS has that user can submit their email questions through, and it's integrated into the CRM that is the ticketing - "ask a question" is the name of the form
  - It's a horrible UX, you end up filling it out for 10 steps, and then you enter your question.  
  - Thought works is replacing the front end of that
  - Submitting the form creates a ticket in the back-end
