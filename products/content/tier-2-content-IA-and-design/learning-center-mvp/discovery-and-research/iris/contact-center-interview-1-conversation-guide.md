# Conversation Guide for IRIS Contact Center Interviews, Round 1

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. I'm part of a team that is working on a new VA.gov product that will help Veterans find answers to questions they have about their VA benefits, account, records - all kinds of topics.

I've invited you here today to better understand content processes in the context of your contact center's customer service, and IRIS content creation.  My hope is that by the end of this hour together we'll have an understanding of 

- who participates in content creation on your team, 
- get a high-level overview of the process, and 
- identify individuals we can speak to more in-depth during a second round of interviews. 

 Since IRIS content will eventually be published in the learning center, it's important that we take your workflows and processes into consideration so we can support you moving forward.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **We have an hour together today.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally move us along to the next topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured everything accurately in our notes. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today? 

## Introductions

Chante passed along your names to me, but I don't know much more beyond that! I'd love to learn more about each of your roles and how they relate to content. I can start and we'll just go around the virtual room.  I'm going to take notes on a Mural board; I'll go ahead and share my screen.

My name is Liz Lantz, and I'm the UX Designer and Researcher for the Public Websites team on VA.gov. My team handles all the content on the site you can see without logging in. My role in the content creation and management process is primarily to design templates used by content creators, and conduct research to inform those designs and help our team better understand content workflows.

*Go around the virtual room and ask:*

- Who are you? What is your title, and what are you responsible for? 
- How does that fit into creating/managing IRIS content (if it's not obvious)?
- (For smaller groups) What's something easy and something hard about your job?

## Content teams

Thanks so much for sharing that. Now that I know how each of you contribute to content creation, and your role, I want to dig in to learn more about your team, or teams. 

- Who is part of the content process that isn't in this meeting today? 
- What are they responsible for? 

- Are there other people you work on content with that we haven't talked about yet? Business stakeholders?

*If it isn't already obvious, ask*:

- Who's ultimately responsible for creating the content on your team? 

- Maintaining the content?
- Who do you recommend we talk to for our more in-depth interviews?

## Content creation/management

That is all really helpful information, thanks for sharing all of that! Let's talk more about the actual content creation and management.

- What are the different kinds of content your team creates and manages?
- Who is the audience for that content?

- How do you determine when you need to create new content?

Okay, so lets say that [reiterate what they said, new content needs to be created] - can you give me an overview of what happens between then and it being published?

- How does that process change for different types of content?

*If it isn't already obvious, ask*:

- How does IRIS fit into this process?
- Are there other systems being used?
- We'd like to observe people going through this process - who do you recommend we reach out to for that? Are those the same people we've already talked about?

## Success/Challenges

Got it, thank you. This is all really helpful as we start to talk about next steps.  I have just a couple more questions before we wrap up.

- What do you think is working well in your content management process?
- What isn't working so well?

## Next steps and Closing

- Do you have any questions for me?
- Reiterate who we should talk to next.  
- Can you make an introduction, or should I just reach out to them and reference this meeting? I assume I can find them in the VA address book?
- Next steps for me will be to reach out and schedule those sessions.

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the learning center.  It was great to meet you - please feel free to reach out to me at any time if you have questions or thoughts to share along the way.
