# Conversation Guide for IRIS Contact Center Interviews, Round 1

DRAFT

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about content creation and management at your contact center . 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **We have an hour together today.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally move us along to the next topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured everything accurately in our notes. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

### Things to watch for:

- What is the role of each person in the meeting?
- How do they answer the easy/hard about their job question?

## Content teams

- I'd like to start by talking about the teams and people that contribute to creating content at your contact center. I will probably fumble over tongue twister the whole time during this meeting.
- I know now how each of you contribute to content creation, and your role.  Who is part of that process that isn't here? What are they responsible for? 
- What's the reporting structure of that team?
- Are there other people you work closely with that we haven't talked about yet?

## Content creation/management

- How does IRIS fit into this process?

- Are there other systems being used?

- We'd like to observe people going through this process - who do you think we can learn the most from?

  

### Things to watch for:

## Success/Challenges

- What do you think is working well in your content management process?

## Next steps and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the learning center.
