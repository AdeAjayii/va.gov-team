This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Research Questions & Answers

**What is the size and structure of each content team?**

- Most teams we spoke to had about 2-4 people on the team, and had a director supported by by 2-3 analysts, assistant chiefs/directors, etc.
- These teams are supported by quality teams who help verify the content they publish is accurate

**Who are the people on these teams and what are they responsible for?**

- A director/chief- making sure things go smoothly. Connecting the dots. Reviewing/approving content, in some cases.
- "Analysts" = editors and writers for internal content, primarily. Producing and maintaining internal content such as job aides, SOPs, and scripts
- A couple of teams had dedicated people who are responsible for entering content and publishing in eGain. NCC has someone who "chunks out content", uses accordions, etc - sounded like someone doing the Drupal work our editors do.
- Training team members - Developing training curriculum and materials
- NCA doesn't have one person or team responsible for content creation and management. All content work is an ancillary responsibility.

**What are the different types of content each team creates and manages, with regard to contact center customer service and IRIS content creation?**

- Content for contact center agents: 
  - job aides, SOPs, procedural guidelines, FAQs, Knowledge Articles, scripts
  - Training curriculum or documents
- All teams we spoke to said they don't create or manage content in IRIS

**Who is the audience for their content?**

- Contact center agents
- People who do PR and other kinds of public-facing events
- Veterans
- VSOs and other Veteran organizations (DMC)

**What is the process for internal scripts that support contact center reps?** 

- Many contact centers don't use scripts, because they want the flexibility to provide custom service for the individual Veteran
- Those that do use scripts didn't outline a different process for scripts vs. other internal content (see below)

**Are they different than the process for customer facing content?**

- We didn't talk to any contact centers that produce customer-facing content
- Some contact centers produce customer facing content in the sense that they're providing materials that will be presented to the public via a person, but they're not producing written articles for Veteran audiences.
- To have customer facing content in IRIS, contact center teams would need to submit a help ticket through Oracle service cloud

**What are the processes related to**

- Creating new content?
  - Receive a request from the business line > draft content, usually in word > get content reviewed by SMEs and/or chief and/or team members, via email or in meetings > update as needed until approved > publish in internal KM (or sometimes goes out as email if it's something small)
  - In IRIS, new content requests would come via a help desk ticket, and admin would create the content in Oracle service cloud and publish to IRIS. Admin assumes content is approved and ready to be published
- Updating existing content?
  - Similar process to creating new content for both scenarios
- Retiring existing content?
  - Usually brought to teams attention by a SME or agent, content is archived, not usually deleted
  - Sometimes content is updated to point to new source of content
  - Most teams do not proactively retire/sunset content unless there was an expiration date provided when the content was created

**Do they have any content style guides?**

- Teams have formatting guides but not guides for voice and tone

**How does IRIS fit into each center's content flow?** 

- All the contact centers we spoke to said they don't use IRIS today
- NCA said they were just handed the IRIS FAQs but aren't sure how to move forward with them, and are waiting to see what happens w/ learning center to figure that out

**How is content maintained in IRIS?**

- An admin updates and manages content via help desk requests, using Oracle Service Cloud

**What other systems are being used?** 

- Egain (NCC, OCC, DMC)
- Sharepoint (DMC)
- Views, for task tracking (NCA)
- Oracle Cloud Service
- "KM" - I assumed this was eGain but may not be.
- "A sales force version of eGain"
- PatR is possibly coming up
- Microsoft Dynamics (MD) was mentioned as "not in the cards, but we'd love that" by VEO, and Michelle said PatR **is** MD so.. ?

**What is the process for reviewing drafts?**

- Typically done by word docs going back and forth via email, or reviewed in meetings

**If they aren't authoring in content in IRIS, what are they using?**

- Word
- SharePoint
- KM/eGain

**What's working well for each contact center in terms of content creation and management?**

- The people! Many teams talked about how strong their teams are
- Review and approval process is good in terms of involving many people, getting lots of eyes on things

**What isn't working well?**

- Not enough people
- Hard to pin down SMEs or get business lines to take ownership of their content

**Who can we interview/observe to gain a more in-depth understanding of these processes?**

Possibly team analysts, if we are interested in the internal content processes. Generally, didn't feel like the work these people are doing is obviously relevant to the learning center.  Might be helpful to get insights into the content publishing process for eGain?

- NCC: Lindsay/Regina for content review/approval process, Billy for eGain publishing process
- NCA: Jim Lapaglia - "he's with web services and has his hands in a lot of different things"
- OCC: Janiece, internal content
- DMC: Julie Lawrence, COO for "external relations" so she may know about any of their external content, need to review recording for other people
- VEO: possibly Dorian Adeymi or Mike Cippioni. Not totally sure what they do.

**Which parts of these content management processes are things we can observe and learn from?**

- Publishing in eGain may be useful to us
- If there is some kind of back-end to IRIS that agents are using to send FAQs to people, that could be useful
