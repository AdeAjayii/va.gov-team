This topline summary is a **high level, top of mind summary** of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**

- To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
- To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Research Questions & Answers

**Is the information easy to find using this search-focused, tag-based navigation?**

- About half of the Veterans in our study focused on browsing links, rather than using search or navigating by using tags
- Search results pages were easy for people to navigate
- Once people realized the tags were clickable, they stated the format of the results were what they expected. Some participants expected the tags to behave has a layer on top of whatever content they were already looking it (and didn't realize the Vietnam War Veterans page was about more than Agent Orange)
- People didn't immediately find the address information we asked them to find from the learning center homepage; about half of the participants went to their benefit topic area to update their address for that benefit.
- People felt the way the homepage was organized made it easy to understand what kinds of information was available.
- "I like the way that it's broken into different benefits - I think a lot of Veterans don't understand that." - P1

**How easily are people able to navigate between learning center articles, and topics?**

- Easily. Clicking links between articles and finding their way back to the learning center homepage.
- That being said, we had to guide users along the way to such a degree that

**Are the template labels (ex: FAQs, Checklist, About, Step-by-step, etc.) useful?**

- Generally, yes. They helped participants 

**What do people see as the difference between the learning center search and overall site search?**

- Multiple people stated they thought the learning center content was related to benefits and benefit information, whereas overall site search would be more high-level "about the VA" content
- 

**Do people get confused if they click on a content link or CTA button in the learning center and it takes them to a benefit hub page? And vice versa?**

- No one got confused going between content in the learning center and benefit hub.
- **Recommendation:** Because the tasks were so specific, this should be re-evaluated when we have a live product on staging, or with a significantly more robust prototype that can more closely mirror a person's natural behavior when looking for information.

**Do people understand that information they don't find in the learning center might be in the benefit hub?**

- People didn't differentiate between the learning center or benefit hub.  
- When asked about where they would find hub information while in the learning center (e.g. applying for a benefit they don't have), most people said they would search, and expected they would stay in the learning center.

**Where would the most useful place be to provide links to the Learning Center?**

- The majority of the people we spoke to said they'd expect to see something about the learning center prominently displayed on the homepage.
- 2 people expected to see it in the navigation.
- 1 person expected it to be promoted offline in order to learn of its existence.

## Hypotheses & Answers

**People will easily understand how to use the search functionality.**

- Everyone understood that the search functionality was keyword based and were clear that the Learning Center 

**Template labels will help people determine which search result is most relevant to their search.**

- 

**People will understand the difference between the Learning Center search and global site search.**

- True. 
- People understood the difference between the Learning Center search and the search in the navigation.  There was some uncertainty between the difference between the radio button options, and expectations varied regarding the results `search VA.gov` would return.

**People won't explicitly differentiate between the benefit hub and the Learning Center; they'll default to using overall site search if they can't find what they're looking for in either place.**

- Mostly true. 
- Nobody acknowledged a difference going between the benefit hub or learning center, and nobody got confused.
- People said they would search to find what they were looking for, but the tasks in the study didn't allow us to conclusively evaluate how people will look for something if they can't find what they are looking for.  Because we had a limited amount of screens that didn't include keyword searching, people would talk through where they thought they'd found something, but we didn't take it a step further to evaluate what they would do when they realized they were wrong.

**Our proposed IA will be effective for Veterans and those who support Veterans.**

## Other Findings

**We should test navigability between articles and the benefit hub again with a live product (rather than a prototype) **

- Answer

**Some people weren't clear that the Learning Center was *part* of VA.gov, rather they talked about it as if it was the whole site.  **

- Answer

**The name "Learning Center" felt right for this product for X of 8 Veterans**

- 2 people expected something called "Learning Center" to contain information related specifically to education, or that it would contain educational content such as ` how to use the VA website` or `using Microsoft word`
- 1 person described the Learning Center to be something that was totally dedicated to them, where they could learn about their claim status, prescriptions, etc.
- Veteran Assistance, Information Center, and Vet Scope were alternative name suggestions.

**2 of 8 Veterans understood the "You're a Veteran..." box to contain personal information specific to them**

- Answer

**No one tried to use search from an article to try to find information from an article page**

- 

**Most people understood the tags were clickable, but expected them to behave as a filter layer on top of the content they were already viewing.**
