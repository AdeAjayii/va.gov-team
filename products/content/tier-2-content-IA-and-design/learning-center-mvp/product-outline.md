## User Problem Statement


The tier 1 Veteran-first benefit hubs are nearly complete migrating legacy content. But there's still a tremendous amount of legacy content that hasn't been brought into the new VA.gov site experience. 

In order to better prioritize content, and so that we don't migrate all content into the benefit hubs, the WBC team created a tiered content framework. 

It's critical that we don't migrate all content into the benefit hubs because that would recreate the old legacy site experience of mixing critical Veteran benefit content with everything else. 

**How do we ensure that helpful, relevant tier 2 information that supports tier 1 Veteran-facing benefit content is accessible and findable in the new VA.gov site experience, AND does not dilute, distract, and clutter Veterans' benefit top task content and UX?**

- Tier 1 content: benefit content and tools (applying for benefits, accessing benefit tools to manage your existing benefits) for beneficiaries (Veterans, family members, service members) 
- __Tier 2 content:__ benefit-adjacent content (for beneficiaries, and people who work with beneficiaries)
- Tier 3 content: organizational/administrative/office content

__What this product is__

This product focuses on creating an IA and content design for tier 2 content that's benefit learning, knowledge, help, and support content categories. 

__What this product is not__

This product is NOT for engagement, marketing, time-based type of tier 2 content such as campaigns. 



## User Goals

__Primary users__

Veterans, family members, and other beneficiaries (or potential beneficiaries)

__Secondary users__

Non-beneficiary audiences who support Veterans, family members and other beneficiaries directly through benefits or benefit related services (e.g., VSOs, loan officers, school administrators)


- Beneficiaries: Easily find and get to relevant, related information that helps me better understand how my benefit works; or better use my benefit; or take advantage of non-benefit program resources or services. 
- Non-beneficiaries (like VSOs, school counselors, etc.): Easily find and get to relevant, related information that helps me better do my job to support/help VA beneficiaries, whether Veteran students in college or caregivers of older Veterans, etc. 





## Business Goals
- Provide a way of incorporating the many benefit-adjacent tier 2 content (from the legacy TeamSite VA.gov) into the new VA.gov 
- Maintain prioritization of Veteran-focused tier 1 benefit content, so benefit hubs continue to provide essential benefit info and access to digital tools




## Assumptions
- That a lot of legacy TeamSite benefit-adjacent content is what we might think of as "more resources," "learning," "knowledge," or "benefit-related engagement" information
- That some of the content that VA business lines call or think of as "benefit" is actually this tier 2 benefit-adjacent "resources"/"learning" content
- EX: Free or subsidized rides for Veterans to their VA medical center. VHA's Veteran Transportation Program business may think of this as a benefit, it's in fact an add-on service or resource that varies from city to city, medical center to medical center, and from year-to-year depending on funding and participation of local nonprofits that each medical center might have relationships with. 
- That there are different audiences for tier 2 benefit-adjacent content. Ex: for Veterans and other beneficiaries; and for people who work with Veterans and other beneficiaries (like VSOs or school administrators)

## Status and decisions

## mm/dd/yyyy


__Historical: status__

Note: Our initial proposal to use the claim status topic as MVP of learning center didn't make traction. Inability to get call center to provide needed call center data and claim status scripts and IRIS articles. We are pivoting to create lo-fi MVP agnostic of business or benefit hub.
