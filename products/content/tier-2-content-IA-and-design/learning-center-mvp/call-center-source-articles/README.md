__Product Guides and Demo Videos__

[All VA.gov product guides can be found here.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/contact-center/vfs-product-guides) Some might be out of date but we mostly have a process for keeping these up to date, at least when it relates to the core functionality. These are used to train new agents as well as help agents understand where a user might be stuck when using a tool that requires LOA3 authenticatication.
