# Status and decisions for MVP Learning Center
## mm/dd/yy


## 06/04/2020

Team Kick-off held, to align on problem to solve, high-level requirements and wireframes. 

**Why The Learning Center**

We have brought over Tier 1 content over for benefits. There is a lot of information that is not in the Tier 1 category but is very helpful content.

The Learning Center aims to house additional help information, knowledge articles about a service or a problem. It is benefit adjacent. The product is not campaign or marketing information, and it is not program office/administration content. The Learning Center is search-focused and tagged, rather than driven by IA and navigation. This will be in Drupal as templates.

**MVP and Requirements**

We plan to use VA.gov account information for this "MVP."
We anticipate that most users will enter the Learning Center organically, via a search or link somewhere. 
Some new functionality that was discussed:
* New/updated Search box with the ability to search within the learning center or va.gov (this is in the learning center, at the top of the pages)
* Tag system - 'Topics' and 'Audience'
* "On this Page" component
* "Back to top" (some of the pages will get really long)
* "Need More Help" section - can be phone numbers, links, links to chat. It will be customizable but something like a chatbot could be 'fixed' on there, if it's available.
* "Was this page helpful?" - TBD on where the data from users would go
* Ability to pull Youtube video, content in for Videos. 

**Identified Areas for User Testing**
The new tag system - by breaking up tags between "Topics" and "Audience", does this help users? The "Topics", for example, would be clickable and would take the user to articles tagged with that topic.
When viewing a list of articles tagged with a topic, we are curious if the types of templates affects what the user chooses to read (FAQs, Checklist, Media List). Would knowing this kind of content be helpful to the user?
Should we plan to conduct testing with the two identified user groups - Veterans, and groups who support Veterans?
