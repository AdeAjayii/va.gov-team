# Status and decisions for MVP Learning Center
## mm/dd/yy


## 06/04/2020

Team Kick-off held, to align on problem to solve, high-level requirements and wireframes. 
**Why The Learning Center**
We have brought over Tier 1 content over for benefits. There is a lot of information that is not in the Tier 1 category but is very helpful content.

The Learning Center aims to house additional help information, knowledge articles about a service or a problem. It is benefit adjacent. The product is not campaign or marketing information, and it is not program office/administration content. The Learning Center is search-focused and tagged, rather than driven by IA and navigation. This will be in Drupal as templates.

**MVP and Requirements**
We plan to use VA.gov account information for this "MVP."
