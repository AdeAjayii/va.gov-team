<summary>Requirements</summary>

### Search
* As a Veteran I want to search experience that will answer my benefit-adjacent support questions.  
  - Search experience that gives Veterans search results to legacy tier 2 content in support of veterans, caregivers, school administrators, VSOs, VA loan       appraisers, etc.

### Articles lists 
* As a Veteran and or Veteran suppot provider a relevant article list is needed that displays most current and relevant articles to my search request. 
  - Article lists should help users self-resolve VA.gov issues that span benefits or that are agnostic of benefit issues. Intent is to funnel users to Tier 1 beneifits hubs for applying and managing benefits.

### Templates
* As a Veteran I need a visual way to view a step-by-step process quick navigation to Tier 1 benefits tools and content.

### Content
* As a Veteran content should point me to Tier 1 benefit tools and resources (eligibility, enrolling, filing, creating an account, signing in to do manage tasks) in order to save me time. 
  - provide contextual content access points in unauthenticated and authenticated product experiences, but only if it’s truly relevant and related information.  All learning content should send people TO tier 1 benefit tools and content (eligibility, enrolling, filing, creating an account, signing in to do manage tasks).

### Tags
* As a Veteran I wanted to browse, explore and discover VA services in a fun and engaging way through learning center tags.   
  - Adapting content tags will encourage UX behavior to browse, explore and enagage content they otherwise wouldn't through legacy search options. Tags are not meant to be a substitute search in the learning center, but a way of filtering the ocean into a lake. Content relevance based on keyword-driven search will be the primary way users can quickly find content in the learning center.
