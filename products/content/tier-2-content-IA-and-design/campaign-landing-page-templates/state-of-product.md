## State of Product: Campaign Landing Page

### What is the Problem to be Solved

Many benefit-adjacent Tier 2 content are not support/learning/help, or evergreen office (administrative) content. Some Tier 2 content is more similar to marketing or engagement content.

 - It may also have audiences other than Veterans (for example: local governments, Congress, VSOs, medical researchers).
 - It may also be time-based -- a particular campaign (#BeThere) or a new legislation (MISSION Act).

This category of tier 2 content could be better served as a **campaign landing page**. Examples of recent VA marketing initiatives that resulted in requests for Web support at VA.gov:

 - Veterans wear your mask campaign
 - Veterans get your flu shot campaign
 - VHA moving forward -- phased re-openings -- covid-19 campaign
 - VHA Covid 19 research recruitment campaign

### Our Bet: Campaign Landing Page

The purpose of this product is to enable an easy way for VA businesses to create and manage this type of content in the Drupal CMS leveraging current and new features/functionality.

The CLP is:

 - 1-page that links to deeper content which the already exists in the benefit hubs, in videos on YouTube, at separate VA domains (such as publichealth.va.gov), at other VA online destinations (e.g. blogs, PDF factsheets, outreach library).  
 - It is created and maintained by VA business stakeholders at VHA, VBA and other groups, with the hands on production expected to be done by their Web leads (e.g. Webmaster or Web Communications lead).

The CLP is **not:**

 - A self-contained micro-site with original content, sub-pages, its own navigation  
 - A sub-domain (e.g. movingforward.va.gov)
