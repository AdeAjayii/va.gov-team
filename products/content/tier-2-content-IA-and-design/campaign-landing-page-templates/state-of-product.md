## State of Product: Campaign Landing Page

### What is the Problem to be Solved

Many benefit-adjacent Tier 2 content are not support/learning/help, or evergreen office (administrative) content. Some Tier 2 content is more similar to marketing or engagement content.

 - It may also have audiences other than Veterans (for example: local governments, Congress, VSOs, medical researchers).
 - It may also be time-based -- a particular campaign (#BeThere) or a new legislation (MISSION Act).

This category of tier 2 content could be better served as a **campaign landing page**. Examples of recent VA marketing initiatives that resulted in requests for Web support at VA.gov:

 - Veterans wear your mask campaign
 - Veterans get your flu shot campaign
 - VHA moving forward -- phased re-openings -- covid-19 campaign
 - VHA Covid 19 research recruitment campaign
