### Content and Business Requirements Q-and-A

X. How will users know to use CLP, vs page in benefit hubs, vs learning center vs Vantage Point?
> Once we have definition and business rules for CLP, we should road test them by setting up several very different CLPs so we can see how CLP would work content-wise. This will show us any "holes" in our strategy and help us hone it.

1. What does the sunset process look like? Should there be an expiration date associated with the CLP (at which point we would set a redirect) or do they live on (to be possibly re-used annually in some cases)?
- When Campaigns are entered by author, there should have expiration date -- Drupal sends the content author and PW team a notification to review the CLP to determine if its should remain live. We would want to remove pages from Server if page is not attracting meaningful traffic.  Would not even re-direct unless there is traffic value.  Possible: The notion of "annual clean-up" (Note: there is no central digital/marketing office/owner for campaigns).   Joint-ownership of this page is likely/intrinsic.  So we can decide whether we optimize or retire, for example.

2. How many CLPs a year is anticipated?  
- 5-10 a year, if we roll it out in phased approach.  If available to all businesses at VA, it could be a lot more than 10 a year.
- Examples of VA campaigns:

  - https://missionact.va.gov/
  - https://www.benefits.va.gov/transition/solid-start.asp
  - https://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/blue-water-navy.asp
  - https://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/financial-literacy.asp
  - https://www.benefits.va.gov/BENEFITS/banking.asp
  - https://www.va.gov/QUALITYOFCARE/education/Mental_Health_Awareness_Month2020.asp
  - https://www.wearewithinreach.net/
    - Can't tell who the audience is
    - Barely actionable
    - Can't tell what the call to action is

3. Is new content created for CLP -- or does it just link to existing content in many places?  

4. Who updates/maintains CLP content? 

5. Who gets to use CLP -- and how will they get the "keys"?
- We will govern via Drupal access. (We don't want a sub--sub-sub VA office using these).  We will limit Drupal access.   Governance will come through PubWeb and the VHA, VBA office heads (e.g. Jenny, Sandy, etc) -- Dual key permission. In rolling out to businesses, we would want to restrict authoring rights to a centralized Webmaster/person per business -- not every person (we don't want 7000 users).

6. Will new content be created to support CLPs and where will that content sit (directory/URL)?


7. Will PW review a CLP before it is launched?
- No, these will not undergo any review.


8. Will CLPs sit in a new sub-directory?
-

9. How will CLPs be found?
- On-site, via CTA's.  Off-site, via marketing and search.

10. Do we have examples of stakeholders using self-service tools we’ve created?
-

11. Do we have any other editorial product (at VA or competitor) to compare CLP usage to measure success?
-

12. Are we seeing data for poor behavior related to the problem we’re trying to solve with CLP? In other words, is the way the business is executing on campaigns not effective and the CLP will address many issues?
-

13. Is it fair to say one of the drivers of CLP -- the problem it solves -- is: we are addressing is Demand (from business stakeholders who want this) and Capacity issues (we don’t have the resources to solve this need)
- 



## Our thoughts on potential KPIs if we stick to business-oriented success:
  * Requests for campaign-esque requests go down (e.g. they now have a self-service tool)
  * Number of CLPs goes up (e.g. the tool allows us to “scale”)
  * Burden on team is measurably reduced (e.g. self-service)
