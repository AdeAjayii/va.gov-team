# Campaign landing page template MVP 1.0 - product outline

Campaign landing page template rolls up to the larger 2020 PW initiatives to build out [tier 2 content templates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design).

## Problem statement
Many benefit-adjacent tier 2 content are not support/learning/help, product, or evergreen office (administrative) content. Some tier 2 content are more similar to marketing or engagement content.

- It may also have audiences other than Veterans (for example: local governments, Congress, VSOs, medical researchers).
- It may also be time based in nature, like a particular campaign (#BeThere) or a new legislation change (MISSION Act).
- This category of tier 2 content could be better served as a campaign landing page.

## Purpose

The purpose of this template is to enable an easy way for PW content team and VA businesses to create and manage this type of content in campaign landing page template in the new CMS, Drupal. 

## Desired User Outcomes

- The primary user(s) of this template -- and CMS functionality -- are the Public Website content team and VA businesses (e.g. VBA Digital Strategy Team) 
- The problem this would solve is to address the demand from the business for a way to more easily, quickly and cost-effectively create a "landing page" destination for thematic marketing andpublic-relations campaigns and initiatives AND/OR to promote [new veteran programs (e.g. Mental Health Awareness Month, PTSD Awareness Month).](https://www.va.gov/QUALITYOFCARE/education/monthly-campaigns.asp)

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Guardrails (user permission settings) need to be instrumented as part of the solution to ensure "rigidity" in both the use of the template as well as the UI layout.   Too much flexibilty will potentially result in (a) over/mis-use of the template and/or (b) layout or content issues that could make the experience sub-optimal for our veteran audience.

## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*

- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Undesired Business Outcomes

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### KPIs
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### OKRs
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

---

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*
