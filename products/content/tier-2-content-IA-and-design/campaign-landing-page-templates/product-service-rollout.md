### MVP Production Release Phase (April-June 2021)

**What Will Happen**

**Goals:** 
To learn and iterate both the product AND the governance approach (e.g. who gets the keys, how is URL determined, what are "must have" feature enhancements needed in the tooling and template)

**Governance Model:**
Availability of the CLP page builder will be limited to four (or five?) VACO digital communication teams: VBA, VHA, VEO/OPIA and NCA.  These leads will be responsible for, and have the ability to:

- Being trained and proficient as a user/editor of the CLP authoring tool ([CMS CLP Training Guide](
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YfNpegO3TS13O7Sd0lnmy-mWf7ywmHPTxxtItchu9AE/edit#slide=id.gc3bbf21d57_0_90))
- Deciding which engagement initiatives are ideal fits for the CLP template
- Requesting the CLP via VA.gov's online submission form and providing all required information
- Working with the VA team/office to produce and quality control the CLP
- Publishing the CLP
- Working with the VA.gov team to "retire/sunset" the CLP

**MVP VACO Teams & Leads**
- VHA Digital Media (Health): Jenny Heiland-Luedtke, Jeffrey Grandon, Adrian Osman (VHADigitalMedia@va.gov)
- VBA Digital Strategy Team (Benefits): Sandy Tadeo (Acting Chief), Adrianne Hooten, John P. DiMartino (WEBADMIN.VBACO@va.gov)
- VEO: Tim Hudek
- OPIA: Bronwyn Emmet
- NCA Web Services: James LaPaglia (NCAWebServices@va.gov)

**Request and Publishing Model:**

### Post-MVP Production Release Phase (June-Forward 2021)


**Goals:** 
To release the CLP to a wider VA digital comms user base -- enabling the tool to be used at scale.

**Governance Model (Draft-WIP):**
- Edit and Publish access will go wider --  with two guardrails in place:
  - the VACO digital comms teams/leads will be resposible for governing edit rights
  - it will be provided to VA communications staffers in the field after they **go through training.**
  - the VACO leads will retain publish rights, to ensure every CLP is reviewed for quality before it is released into production
- For this phase:
  - The URL must be set dynamically (e.g. via H1)
  - Set-up of the CLP will be the responsibility of the VACO digital comms teams (VHA, VBA, VEO, NCA, OPIA) -- not the Public Websites product team.
  - The request form process will still be used to help establish the analytics requirements, including establishment of campaign unique tracking codes (UTM). 
  - There will be no Platform review before publication

**Considerations**
- Will we shift to a fully self-service model -- e.g. such as VAMC or Vet Centers?
- Will there be any VA.gov and VACO leads governance (a throttle) -- e.g.,request and light Platform review before publication? 
  - Or, will VACO lead teams have the ability to request access for more editor/users?
- Will the URL be dynamically generated?
- Training requirements: 
  - CMS proficiency
  - Adherence to the design/UX principles
  - Plain language
  - Accessibility
