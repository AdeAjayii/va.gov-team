### MVP Production Release Phase (April-June 2021)

**What Will Happen**

**Goals:** 
To learn and iterate both the product AND the governance approach (e.g. who gets the keys, how is URL determined, what are "must have" feature enhancements needed in the tooling and template)

**Governance Model:**
Availability of the CLP page builder will be limited to four (or five?) VACO digital communication teams: VBA, VHA, VEO/OPIA and NCA.  These leads will be responsible for, and have the ability to:

- Being trained and proficient as a user/editor of the CLP authoring tool ([CMS CLP Training Guide](
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YfNpegO3TS13O7Sd0lnmy-mWf7ywmHPTxxtItchu9AE/edit#slide=id.gc3bbf21d57_0_90))
- Deciding which engagement initiatives are ideal fits for the CLP template
- Requesting the CLP via VA.gov's online submission form and providing all required information
- Working with the VA team/office to produce and quality control the CLP
- Publishing the CLP
- Working with the VA.gov team to "retire/sunset" the CLP

**MVP VACO Teams & Leads**
- VHA Digital Media (Health): Jenny Heiland-Luedtke, Jeffrey Grandon, Adrian Osman (VHADigitalMedia@va.gov)
- VBA Digital Strategy Team (Benefits): John P. DiMartino (Chief), Tanekwa Bournes (Program Analyst), Adrianne Hooten
- VEO: Tim Hudek
- OPIA: Bronwyn Emmet
- NCA Web Services: James LaPaglia (NCAWebServices@va.gov)

**MVP Request and Publishing Model (April-June 2021):** 

For the MVP phase, the goal was to publish three CLPs to test -- with production release -- the functionality of the tool and associated processes (e.g. establishment and set up of URL, Analytics, and UTMs).

The following three CLPs were launched as part of this phase:

- Trust: https://www.va.gov/initiatives/veteran-trust-in-va/. (VEO-Tim Hudak)
- Pride Month: https://www.va.gov/initiatives/recognizing-lgbtq-veterans-during-pride-month/ (OPIA-John Santos)
- COVID-19 Vaccine Questions: http://va.gov/covid-vaccine-questions (COVID JTF and VHS-Danielle Thierry)

The following IA guidelines were established as part of this phase:

- The CLP will sit within a new "initiatives" sub-directory of VA.gov -- https://va.gov/initiatives/h1-of-clp -- but will not appear in the VA.gov IA.
- The URL is set dynamically via the H1 (with hyphens)
- There will be NO links to CLPs from global menus, footers, or tier 1 benefit pages.


### Post-MVP Production Release Phase (June-Forward 2021)


**Goals:** 
To release the CLP to VACO Digital Comms teams -- enabling the tool to be used at wider scale, with VA business self-governance.

**Governance Model (Draft-WIP):**
- Edit and Publish access will go wider --  with two guardrails in place:
  - the VACO digital comms teams/leads will be resposible for governing edit rights
  - it will be provided to VA communications staffers in the field after they **go through training.**
  - the VACO leads will retain publish rights, to ensure every CLP is reviewed for quality before it is released into production
- For this phase:
  - The URL must be set dynamically (e.g. via H1) with hyphens
  - The CLP will sit within a new "initiatives" sub-directory of VA.gov -- https://va.gov/initiatives/h1-of-clp -- but will not appear in the VA.gov IA.
  - There will be NO links to CLPs from global menus, footers, or tier 1 benefit pages.
  - Determing what is a CLP will be the responsibility of the VACO digital comms teams (VHA, VBA, VEO, NCA, OPIA) -- not the Public Websites product team.  We will hold a session with each to walk through the process and governance.   Our guidance:
    - CLPs are temporary.
    - Temporary clp’s need to drive traffic TO benefits or tools or products, not the other direction.
    - Temporary clp’s can be seasonal or recurring or somehow temporary (like flu season 2020, flu season 2021) but not duplicative of evergreen content.
    - Ideally, temporary clp’s are used to do targeted messaging to targeted audiences -- e.g. Flu Vaccines for Female Veterans
 - The request form process will still be used to help establish the analytics requirements, including establishment of campaign unique tracking codes (UTM), vanity URLs. 
  - There will be no VA.gov Platform or Product review before publication
    - Intake of the request form 
    - Setting up the cloned site (or can the VACO leads do?)
    - Getting analytics dashboard setup via ticket
    - Getting UTMs established via ticket and worksheet
    - Getting vanity URL redirect(s) established and deployed via ticket
 - There will be no VA.gov Platform or Product review before publication

**Considerations**
- Will we shift to a fully self-service model -- e.g. such as VAMC or Vet Centers?
- Will there be any VA.gov and VACO leads governance (a throttle) -- e.g.,request and light Platform review before publication? 
  - Or, will VACO lead teams have the ability to request access for more editor/users?
- Will the URL be dynamically generated?
- How will positioning of the CLP within the VA.gov site IA be determined? (e.g. case-by-case or in a Campaign subsection w/in each Benefit hub?)
- Training requirements: 
  - CMS proficiency
  - Adherence to the design/UX principles
  - Plain language
  - Accessibility
