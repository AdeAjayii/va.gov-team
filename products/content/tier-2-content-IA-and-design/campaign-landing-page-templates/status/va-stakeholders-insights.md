## VA Stakeholders - Campaign Publishing Insights

To better understand how VA Marketing/Communication (MarCom) teams currently manage the production of digital campaigns (to support annual and one-off marketing and engagement initiatives), we will conduct a discovery sprint consisting of stakeholder interviews to capture and synthesize answers to key questions that will help us anticipate various unique use cases and find commonalities.

The goal is to help understand how much rigidity and alternatively flexibility is needed for the following:

- Who gets to use -- everyone at any time, or is access per request?
- Authoring governance - e.g. will their be tiers of access per user account?
- URL-configuration -- e.g. https://www.va.gov/health-care/campaign/reach or https://www.va.gov/campaign/reach (note: Many campaigns will have vanity URLs redirects -- e.g. va.gov/reach 
- Lifecycle of CLP (e.g. does it ever expire/get deleted?)

| Questions |VBA (Sandy Tadeo) |VHA (Jeffrey Grandon)|
|--|--|--|
|How many campaigns a year? | It depends, we usually build a campaign (landing) page when there’s a new initiative like the banking program (VBBP) or the VA Solid Start (VASS). These are mostly projects that VBA leadership initiate, so they are very prominent and we are then tasked to have web presence and social media campaigns around them. We had about 5 in 2019. There are probably other initiatives from business lines that would benefit from having campaign pages, but we just don’t have the bandwidth to extend this capability to them. If they can do it themselves, that’s great.| TBD |
|Does a campaign page stay live or expire? |Almost all of them remain active. I don’t remember taking anything down (so far). One was “archived”, benefits.va.gov/gibill75 – it’s  still active but we’ve already celebrated the GI Bill 75th anniversary 2 years ago, it’s still there for reference.  | TBD |
|Should some campaign pages become permanent fixtures of the benefits Hubs – e.g. Blue Water Navy| Currently, most of them are permanent pages on benefits.va.gov, because they are benefits initiatives (and some were passed by Congress as law, like BWN). I guess I’m not sure when we’ll need to transition an initiative from being a campaign to just a regular page, if necessary. This may be something that you can answer for us, if possible. In addition, I guess we would also need to determine which topics would necessitate having campaign pages (or just a plain ol’ Drupal page). I think it would be beneficial to have some guidelines and best practices when building these campaign pages.| TBD |

## How To Differentiate Content Tiers and Publishing Modes

| Tier 1-2-3 Content | Resources & Support | Campaign Landing Page |
|--|--|--|
|- **Tier 1 Content** - Benefit content and tools (applying for benefits, accessing benefit tools to manage your existing benefits) for beneficiaries, including Veterans, family members, service members <br> - **Tier 2 Content** - Benefit-adjacent content (for beneficiaries, and people who work with beneficiaries) <br> - **Tier 3 Content** - Organizational/administrative/office content | Resources & Support is reserved for "how-to" and learning content | A Campaign Landing page is reserved for |
