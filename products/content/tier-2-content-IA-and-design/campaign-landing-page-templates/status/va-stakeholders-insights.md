## VA Stakeholders - Campaign Publishing Insights

To better understand how VA Marketing/Communication (MarCom) teams currently manage the production of digital campaigns (to support annual and one-off marketing and engagement initiatives), we will conduct a discovery sprint consisting of stakeholder interviews to capture and synthesize answers to key questions that will help us anticipate various unique use cases and find commonalities.

The goal is to help understand how much rigidity and alternatively flexibility is needed for the following:

- Who gets to use -- everyone at any time, or is access per request?
- Authoring governance - e.g. will their be tiers of access per user account?
- URL-configuration -- e.g. https://www.va.gov/health-care/campaign/reach or https://www.va.gov/campaign/reach (note: Many campaigns will have vanity URLs redirects -- e.g. va.gov/reach 
- Lifecycle of CLP (e.g. does it ever expire/get deleted?)
