## Campaign Landing Page Approved Governance Model

**IA Governance**

- The CLP will sit within a new "initiatives" sub-directory of VA.gov -- https://va.gov/initiatives/h1-of-clp -- but **will not appear in the VA.gov global site navigation (header, footer, side) nor will links be allowed from the Benefit Hubs.**
- The root URL is set dynamically via the H1 (with hyphens) and will be reviewed by the VA product/IA team; vanity URLs will only be allowed/supported after VA.gov IA review.
- Unless a seasonal campaign, CLPs will be temporary -- they will have a start and end date, and they will be removed/deleted from the VA.gov site with a redirect specified by the VA business stakeholder to support the "expiration" of the page.
  - Seasonal CLPs (examples include Flu Vaccination, Pride Month) can be archived via CMS (unpublished) and revived on an annual basis.  Both the root and vanity URL need to be re-directed (Question: Is 404 acceptable?)

**Governance Model (Draft-WIP):**

- **Goal:** To allow VACO Digital Comms teams to self-publish with little "overhead" required by VA.gov digital teams (Public Website and CMS Product)
- **How It Works:**
  - The VACO Web Communications (Web Comms) teams/leads will be the business owners of the CLP (with Public Websites and CMS Product Support remaining the Product Owner). That means, the leads on those teams:
    - Decide what is a CLP – including assessing requests from Offices, Leadership, etc.  Criteria include:
      - Is this a campaign or a blog post? 
      - Is the content duplicative? 
      - Is this time-bound?  A campaign must have an end date.
      - CLPs need to drive traffic TO benefits or tools or products, not the other direction.
      - CLPs can be seasonal or recurring(like Flu Season 2020, Pride Month 2020) but not duplicative of evergreen content
    - Are responsible for ensuring the quality of the CLP -- e.g. look/feel, plain English content, accessibility)
    - Must kick-off the CLP process by communicating their plan -- via dedicated Teams channel -- to the Web Governance Board chaired by Josh Tushcher of OPIA.  This is to ensure cross-organizational alignment (e.g. this does not conflict with strategic communications initiatives by another VACO team)
    - Must kick-off the CLP process by creating/submitting the CLP request form. The request form will be used for two purposes:
      - To ensure the CLP meets the criteria for a Campaign and to ensure key information (e.g. name, goals, start-end date, URL requirements, etc.) are identified up-front
      - To make the Public Websites and CMS Product Support teams aware a new CLP is planned in case limited support is needed (user access, site cloning, vanity URL set-up) **Note:** There will be no VA.gov Platform or Product review before publication of the CLP
    - Build or oversee the build of the CLP
    - Manage any page updates
    - Create and implement share links (UTMs)
    - Monitor CLP performance (via Google Analytics)
    - Request “take down” of page when campaign ends, specifying the redirect strategy and/or URL

- VACO Web Comms Teams - CLP Training requirements: 
  - How to use CMS
  - How to use the Campaign Page builder, with special focus on how to add/edit photos, add videos, add PDFs.
  - Content - VA.gov style/tone and plain English 
  - Accessibility 
  - Design/UX - Adherence to VA.gov design principles
  - Information Architecture, with focus on URL (including H1 and Vanity) setting
  - Will be provided with three "artifacts"
    - Campaign Landing Page Info Form - This is the info CLP stakeholders will use to (a) compile upfront about the campaign/page and; (b) is helpful in determing if the initiative is a good fit for CLP.
    - Campaign Landing Page Content Build Template - This Word doc can be used to pre-create a CLP before you use the CMS to build the page.
