### User Testing Session 1 - Tim Hudak, VEO

- Wanted four Audiences -- so w/o that option he discovered he could just typed in additional audiences -- e.g. and their families and survivors
- Can't edit existing promos -- you have to remove and add
- For photo additions: Save & Select vs. Save & Insert is confusing
- Picking Content Governance was missed every time.
- Having to pick a video already in the media library -- vs. uploading a new one -- was viewed as a confusing constraint.
- User struggled to understand what each Panel would look like -- so maybe a screenshot reference of a CLP for each panel as opposed to a graphic would make it easier to build with context.


**Product Iteration Themes**
1. Add image of a complete CLP and each Panel in-line as a reference to help contextualize what is being built (Note: Emphasize to user that they can Preview each panel once they Save)
2. Include ability to sort the optional Panels. (Explore implications of allowing the user to make Video a Hero option.)
3. Build-in a "Sign Up for Newsletter" component or Panel with integration to [GovDelivery](https://admin.govdelivery.com/session/new)
4. Make Video authoring experience easier and more flexible
