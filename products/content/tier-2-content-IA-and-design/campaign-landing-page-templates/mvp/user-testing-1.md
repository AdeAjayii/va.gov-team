### User Testing Session 1 - Tim Hudak, VEO

**Product Iteration Themes**

1. Add image of a complete CLP and each Panel in-line as a reference to help contextualize what is being built (Note: Emphasize to user that they can Preview each panel once they Save)
2. Include ability to sort the optional Panels. (Explore implications of allowing the user to make Video a Hero option.)
3. Build-in a "Sign Up for Newsletter" component or Panel with integration to [GovDelivery](https://admin.govdelivery.com/session/new)
4. Make Video authoring experience easier and more flexible
5. Overall, believes the CLP is simple enough -- easier in many ways than TeamSite and existing Blog-creation tool <?> -- that any digital comms staffer could use as is w/o training (both those at the VACO and at the field level).

### User Testing Session 2 - Tanekwa Bournes, VBA

Minor Tweaks Observations

1. Enable this page segment -- change to Use this Panel
2. What You Can Do Panel needs more required fields -- right now, user can half format 
3. Where is alt.text for images and video

**Product Iteration Themes**

1. Would like ability to re-arrange the panels
2. Consider the addition of a What's on the Page TOC with hotlinks
3. Make easier the form in context to the actual panel -- maybe the visual example to start.
