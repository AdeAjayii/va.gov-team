### User Testing Session 1 - Tim Hudak, VEO

- Wanted 4 Audiences -- so w/o that option he discovered he could just typed in additional audiences -- e.g. and their families and survivors
- Can't edit existing promos -- you have to remove and add
- For photo additions: Save & Select vs. Save & Insert is confusing
- Picking Contnet Governance was missed every time.
- Having to pick a video already in the media library -- vs. uploading a new one -- was viewed as a confusing constraint.
- User struggled to understand what each Panel would look like -- so maybe a screenshot reference of a CLP for each panel as opposed to a graphic would make it easier to build with context.
