# Content strategy and IA collaboration

## Document purpose

There are multiple related content strategy and IA efforts in progress at this time. While Sitewide Content and IA is leading these efforts, there are other teams that are engaged in related aspects of this work. This document serves as an index to content strategy and IA documentation related to Sitewide Content and IA efforts for awareness and collaboration:
- Optimizing benefit hub content/IA
- Refining content strategy and expanding authors for Resources and Support
- Defining all content types within the VA content ecosystem
- Creating structured content to support expanded COPE capabilities

### Define benefit hub eligibility criteria

This is an an effort to move us away from the more amporphous "tier 1, tier 2, tier 3" content type labels and toward a more clear and defined definition of what content belongs in different spaces. We start with the VA.gov benefit hubs. Using our VA.gov eligibility pattern for benefits, we aim to clearly define the criteria for what makes content "eligible" for inclusion in a benefit hub and whether that content warrants its own page or a mention/link within a hub. This will help our VA.gov sitewide content team better respond to requests to add content within the benefit hubs, and will help all VA content strategy and IA partners better align and collaborate on providing an optimal experience for Veterans.

### Discovery of all potential content types in the VA content ecosystem

This is a working Mural board designed to capture potential content types in the VA content ecosystem. Are you working on a discovery effort related to VA content? We encourage you to actively participate in this Mural as you go, adding sticky notes based on what you find. We'll regularly review this board and reach out to talk more about discovery findings and progress.
