# Content strategy roadmap to completion

## Criteria for prioritization

- **Audience and content topic:** We have a "home" for benefit and service content for Veterans and other beneficiaries. We will prioritize migrating content that fits this definition to the Drupal environment. While auditing sites/sections, we'll also identify content for other audiences that may either be suited to migrate to the new WordPress VIP space or may need another solution (such as content for health care providers).
- **Engagement:** We will prioritize pages and sites with 
  

## Currently in progress

- **Education rates content:** Aiming for completion in September 2022
- **Community care content for Veteran and other beneficiary pages (R&S pilot partner):** Aiming for completion in October 2022
- **Board of Veterans Appeals content for Veterans and other beneficiaries (R&S pilot partner):** Aiming for completion in December 2022

### Single pages among top 1,000 urls by pageviews

These are single pages that require a relatively low level of effort to migrate and are on the "top 1,000 urls" by pageviews list that is a focus of current accessibility efforts. Some have serious accessibility issues so prioritizing migration is a win for both migration and accessibility.

### Full sections and subdomains

These full sections and subdomains will take significantly more time and effort to migrate. Each presents a unique situation in terms of content (i.e. mixed audiences, content types) and VA program partner needs and perspectives. For each, we'll need to determine the following:
- If we have an existing modernized "home" for most/all of the content. And, if not, how do we help program offices ensure that content remaining in the legacy environment for now still works from a UX perspective?
- If we can effectively flow the content into the existing navigation structure (i.e. benefits hubs + R&S)
- How we might need to iterate on R&S taxonomy or UX to accomodate new content
- Whether a subdomain or new site section may make sense in any cases

As we migrate this content, we also need to bring each program office into the Drupal environment, provide training on both Drupal and plain language, and get shared alignment around our content strategy, content placement criteria, VA.gov content style guide, and editorial processes. This work is slow, but building a partnership and shared alignment is critical to long-term success.

High-priority full sections include the following:

- va.gov/geriatrics
- 


High-priority subdomains include the following:

- caregiver.va.gov
- womenshealth.va.gov
