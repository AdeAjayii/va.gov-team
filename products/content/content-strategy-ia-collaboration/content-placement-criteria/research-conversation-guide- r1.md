Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 2 hours.** 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the tools to better meet your needs. We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let us know.** 
- **Is everyone comfortable if I record this session as we talk?** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record this session? 

## Introduction to criteria - 15 minutes

Today you will be evaluating a set of criteria intended to provide guidance in determining if content should be placed within the benefit hub area of VA.gov or the Resources and Support section.

*[Share screen with spreadsheet of criteria]

- We are going to provide you with 5 content pages that a stakeholder has asked be migrated into the modernized VA.gov experience.  
- We would like you to look at each page and utilize the criteria and make a determination of whether that content should be placed in a benefit hub, Resources and Support, or neither.
- Some of this content may look familiar to you, and we ask that you do not make the determination based on what you know about where it lives today, but instead use the criteria to reach an answer.
- We then ask you to make notes within the provided spreadsheet to indicate your placement decision. 
- In the final column of the spreadsheet please enter any feedback, comments or questions that you encountered while using the criteria for this content.
