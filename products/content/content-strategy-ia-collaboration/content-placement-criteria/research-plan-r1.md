# Research Plan for Sitewide Content and IA - Benefit content placement criteria
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background

Benefit content for Veterans and other beneficiaries has rapidly expanded since the launch of VA.gov, and will continue to expand through the continued migration of legacy content as well as the creation of new content. We currently have 2 primary products to support new content in the Veteran benefit experience - the benefit hubs and Resources and support.  To date, there has not been a clear strategy or criteria to determine whether content should be placed within one content product or the other. 

Sitewide Content and IA have created a set of data-driven criteria to be used by content authors to determine content placement within the benefit hubs or Resources and Support. Our hypothesis, is that with this in place, content authors will be able quickly determine the placement of new content, OCTO and our VA partners will be able to make faster, more strategic decisions to move migration forward, and Veterans will be able to easily find the level of content they need to proceed with applying for their benefits.

### OCTO Goals 

Which [OCTO goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? 

- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov
- Platform users can build and deploy high-quality products for Veterans


### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?

- Veterans and other beneficiaries explore and apply for VA benefits from "Getting out" to "Dying"
- Veterans and other beneficiaries get quick, targeted answers to questions about their VA benefits and more information to empower them to fully understand and make the most of VA benefits, programs, and services

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

- We want to understand if the content placement criteria helps OCTO-DE content authors feel confident in making quicker decisions of where to place content in the modernized VA.gov environment.
- We want to find out if content authors' decisions about content placement map to our intentions with the criteria.


### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

Feedback from this research effort will determine whether or not the criteria prove helpful in determining the placement of new content on the site.  If the criteria is helpful, feedback gathered will allow us to make any needed refinements and move forward with using the criteria during the Resources and Support pilot. We'll further learn from feedback gathered during the pilot. 

### Research questions

- Is the concept of this criteria a helpful tool in determining where to place content on VA.gov?
- Are the placement criteria clear and understandable?
- Are the placement criteria effective in determining placement of content?
- Are there any gaps in the placement criteria that result in the inability to make a decision on content placement?

### Hypothesis

- Content authors will use the placement criteria to confidently decide where to place content on VA.gov
- The tighter criteria will result in reduced content within the benefit hubs, thereby creating a more streamlined content flow to applying for Veterans and beneficiaries


## Method	
Describe the method youâ€™re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

We'll conduct an 1.5-hour, semi-structured group research session:
  - 15 min introduction to the research and overview of the criteria
  - 5 min of initial questions
  - 40 min of unmoderated individual working time
  - 30 min of follow up discussion and feedback

### Location

Remote testing via Zoom
