# Research findings for Sitewide Content and IA - Benefit content placement criteria

**Danielle Thierry, Mikki Northuis**

View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/content-strategy-ia-collaboration/content-placement-criteria/research-plan-r1.md).

## Research Goals 

We want to understand if the content placement criteria helps content authors feel confident in making quicker decisions of where to place content in the modernized VA.gov environment.


## Research Methodology 

A group session was held with 4 members of the Sitewide Content and IA team and 1 content designer from CMS.  
The participants completed an activity individually, and then everyone regrouped for a moderated discussion. 


### Who we talked to

Description of who was spoken to.

### Research Questions

Research questions we looked to answer: 
- Is the concept of this criteria a helpful tool in determining where to place content on VA.gov?
- Are the placement criteria clear and understandable?
- Are the placement criteria effective in determining placement of content?
- Are there any gaps in the placement criteria that result in the inability to make a decision on content placement?

## Key Findings
The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form". See an example of this section [on the Caregiver findings document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/usability-testing-jan2020/research-findings.md).

1. Finding one
2. Finding two
3. Finding three
4. Finding four
5. Finding five
6. Finding six
7. Finding seven


## Details of Findings
**1. Content authors found the criteria to be helpful, easy to use, and led them to a confident decision.**
- After the activity, the participants were asked to rate the criteria on helpfulness, ease of understanding, and decision confidence on a scale of 1-5, 1 being the lowest score and 5 being highest.
  - Ease of use averaged 4.4
  - Helpfulness of criteria averaged 4.2
  - Confidence in decisions averaged 4.4
- In addition, the group agreed that having the criteria would be useful in explaining decisions to stakeholders. 

**2. Criteria #3 proved to be the most challenging to understand**
- The challenging aspects to this criteria were two-fold
  - Use of the words "core or supplemental benefit" was unclear
  - There was some uncertainty around "unique application or application process"
- "Core" versus "supplemental" benefit
  - When prompted to define the difference, responses ranged - one felt that if there's a specific application or form to fill out, it's supplemental, even if its the same form as the main benefit, while another questioned if core is what everyone is given and supplemental is based on unique circumstances.
  - When the group was asked if they agreed with the definitions given, besides a slight head nod from one person, the group did not provide a response back in agreement or disagreement.
  - _"...I did spend a lot of time on the core vs. supplemental. I don't know why I struggled with it because it didn't say you had to do anything different for the 2, but I think I know enough to be dangerous and found myself thinking that those terms are important and wanting to define them."_
- "Unique application or application process" 
  -  The group discussed if "application process" included anything specific you had to do to get ready to apply or after you apply.  Additional evidence was given as an example. 
  -  It was noted a couple of times in discussions and their worksheets that individuals looked for reference or a link to an application or form, and when found answered "yes" to this question. 
    -  _"They have to file for disability benefits, but then also have to file 1 of 2 additional forms."_  
  - One suggestion that gathered some agreement, was to split the criteria to call out unique application and unique process as separate questions.  


**3. Decisions were made at the page level, although there was some consideration to splitting content**
- Although their worksheets didn't reference it as a decision, some individuals considered how content could potentially be broken up between the benefit hub and R&S.
  - _"You could take out the question "What's an Agent Orange exam, and how do I request one?" and move that to Resources and support since it's not a requirement for the Veteran to receive disability benefits."


**4. Accuracy of decisions...What was the expected result for these??**
- Three of the 5 pages evaluated had full agreement for benefit hub placement: clothing allowance, PTSD and Camp Lejeune water contamination
  - No comments or references were made about any of these pages being challenging to decide
  - One individual suggested some content on the PTSD page may be a candidate for R&S 
- Two of the 5 pages received a few decisions for R&S, but there was not consensus: Agent Orange and Dental care
  - Challenges with Agent Orange page
    - Content was significantly longer than other pages given...In general, decisions were focused at the page level
    - 2 individuals referenced some content in the page could be moved to R&S, however they placed the page in the benefit hubs 
    - 2 individuals expressed lower confidence in their decision 
    - 2 individuals placed the content in the benefit hub, however they did indicate that they were unsure what the benefit(s) was
    - _" This wasn't a slam-dunk decision. I couldn't decide if it directly supports Veterans in applying for benefits, or if its additonal information and resources about Agent Orange"_ 
  - Challenges with Dental care page
    - Content was very short, but linked to a PDF that provided more in-depth information.
    - Only 1 individual placed this content in the benefit hub, 3/5 placed it in R&S, and 1 individal was undecided
    - 2 individuals indicated that pulling in more content from the PDF and elsewhere would make it more suited for benefit hub placement
    - It seemed as though the group had a bias that it is a benefit for Veterans and they therefore wanted to find a way to place it in the benefit hubs 


**5. Individual biases and experience of the person doing the evaluation played a part in making the decision**
- Existing knowledge and biases of what is considered a benefit, and where benefit content should be placed, played a part in decision making (i.e. "tier 1", veteran-facing content)
  - _"I'm not sure that extra content belongs in R&S, maybe another hub page would be better, because I still feel like it's tier 1 because it's for Veterans."_
- Many members of the group cited times where they would revise a heading, restructure the content, or elaborate on content in order to build out a better page. Doing this would occassionally lead them to making a different decision.
- Despite criteria answers resulting in a R&S placement for the Dental health page for the entire group, the majority of them expressed some level of disagreement with it.  
  - _"It's written like it's trying to convince you that it's R&S, but the more you look at it, it feels like benefit hub."_
  - _"I put in R&S as it is now, but would go to benefit hub if you took info from the linked fact sheet and how to apply for it"_
  
**6. The layout and format of the worksheet could use some minor improvements**
- Not everyone was clear that if you answered "yes" to criteria 4, the decision was made and you did not need to go on to the last criteria.  
  - _"I went on to # 5 every time, even though I answered "yes" to the fourth one"_

## Recommendations

**Utilize individual bullets and/or questions to make criteria easier to read and follow**
- The group liked how criteria #5 used bullets to list out the individual scenarios and suggested the same formatting be followed for criteria 2 and 3. 

**Revise criteria 3 to provide more clarity and meaning**
- Clarify meaning of "unique application form" and "unique application process"**
- Define "core" versus "supplemental"

**Improve formatting to ensure that criteria 5 is only referenced in correct scenarios**
