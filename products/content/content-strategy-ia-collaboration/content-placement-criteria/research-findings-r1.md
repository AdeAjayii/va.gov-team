**Danielle Thierry, Mikki Northuis**

View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/content-strategy-ia-collaboration/content-placement-criteria/research-plan-r1.md).

## Research Goals 

We want to understand if the content placement criteria helps content authors feel confident in making quicker decisions of where to place content in the modernized VA.gov environment.


## Research Methodology 

A group session was held with 4 members of the Sitewide Content and IA team and 1 content designer from CMS.  
The participants completed an activity individually, and then everyone regrouped for a moderated discussion. 


### Who we talked to

Description of who was spoken to.

### Research Questions

Research questions we looked to answer: 
- Is the concept of this criteria a helpful tool in determining where to place content on VA.gov?
- Are the placement criteria clear and understandable?
- Are the placement criteria effective in determining placement of content?
- Are there any gaps in the placement criteria that result in the inability to make a decision on content placement?
