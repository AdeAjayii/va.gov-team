## Introduction and activity instructions - 15 minutes

### Intro

Thanks for joining us today! Today we're going to do an activity to help evaluate new criteria for determing where content should be placed between the benefit hubs and Resources and Support.  

This entire session should take about 2 hours.  We ask that you turn off slack notifications and emails during this session, so we can have your full focus on completing the activity. 

Is everyone comfortable if I record this session as we talk? 

*Start recording.*

The goal of this session, is to get your feedback on a set of criteria intended to be used in determining where content should be placed within the modernized VA.gov experience.  
We will be giving you a hypothetical situation that requires you to use this new criteria to evaluate some content for placement on the site. 

There will be 2 parts to today's session.  
- First,  you will each be working independently on an activity for approximately 30-40 minutes. 
- Then, at the completion of the activity, we will come back together for a group discussion.
 
Ready?

### Activity set up

Today your team was given the task of reviewing and possibly reorganizing some content on VA.gov.  You have been asked to review 5 pages of that content and determine where it should live within the modernized VA.gov experience - the benefit hubs or Resources and Support.  To help with this task, you have been given some newly written placement criteria to use in your decision making. 

To do this activity, 
- We will provide you with a word document containing the 5 content pages.  
- We will also provide you with a spreadsheet that includes the new placement criteria. 
- The spreadsheet is your working document and where you will indicate your decision on placement, as well as any thoughts, questions, or feedback. 


[Drop files into DM]

I just dropped the 2 documents into our group DM, please download and save locally for your use.  
I will give you each a couple of minutes to download and open them up and take a quick look.


**A few notes:**
- Some of this content may look familiar to you - we ask that you do not make your decision based on what you know about where it lives today, but instead use the criteria to reach an answer.
- There are no wrong answers, we are evaluating the criteria, not your work.
- You are not required to keep the content pages in tact. They can be broken up if you find that some pieces belong in one place, while other pieces belong elsewhere. Please indicate your decisions and approach as best as you can in the spreadsheet. 
- You may determine that some content does not belong in either the benefit hubs or R&S. Please indicate that in the spreadsheet along with any supporting thoughts. 
- You do not need to rewrite or restructure content, just provide focus on the placement decision.
- Please work on the pages in the order they are in the Word document. It is ok if you do not get to all of the pages, just do your best to progress through as many as you can.

Any questions about the activity?


## Breakout for activity: 30-40 minutes

Ok, let's get started!

- During the activity, we will keep the zoom call open so you can ask questions as needed.  We will not be able to answer questions about the criteria or content themselves, but we can help with the activity. 
- Everyone should be muted, and you may turn your cameras off while you work. We will turn ours off as well. 
- At the end of the activity, I will ask you to drop your copy of the spreadsheet into the DM with your notes and decisions, so keep add working notes to the file.  
- We will check in with you all in about 30 minutes to see how it is going. 

Are you all ready?

See you all in about 30 minutes!

[Note time - give 30-35 minutes]
[Check in at 30-35 minutes to see how everyone is doing. Give them a 5-10 minute warning to finish up if needed]

## 5 minute break

Ok, if I can get everyone to come back to the call.

We are going to take a 5 minute break before we start the group discussion.  
If you could please drop your spreadsheet into the DM from earlier before you break, that would be great!

See you back here at [TIME]


## Post-activity discussion - 30-40 minutes

Welcome back everyone!

We would like to have a group discussion to hear your thoughts on using the placement criteria.  
- Not everyone may have landed on the same decision, and that is absolutely ok!
- We are looking to learn how each of you, as individuals, understood and used the criteria. 
- Your feedback and thoughts will not offend us in any way, we really do want to hear from each of you.
