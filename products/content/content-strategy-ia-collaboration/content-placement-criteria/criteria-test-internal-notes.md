1 to 5 (hard to easy)

- BP: 5
- RH: 5
- EW: 4
- PS: 3


## What did you find most challenging about the criteria?

- BP: Overall, it made sense to me and I think it's great. But I also have thought about this a ton...for 3rd one, I had a little bit of rewording suggestions for "unique application." When I first read it, I didn't think of an application as a form but rather how do you apply this. But then when I was thinking about "application process," it made me think does that include additional evidence that's way more extensive than what would be required? I took it not to mean evidence (or extensive evidence)...I didn't include gathering additional extensive
  - EW: I was confused by that as well. I'm new to the content and the process, but I wasn't sure about the definition of "application." And by "process," does that include anything that you have to do to get ready + apply + after? 
 - RH: I took it as "application." I was looking for is there an application there? Is there a link to the application? But again, I'm steeped in the content.
 - BP: The other part of #3 that was challenging was thinking through what we mean by "core benefit" vs. "supplemental benefit." Maybe giving an example or a definition could help. It seems kind of obvious, but it made me pause.
 - RH: It didn't matter to me
 - PS: I'm not as familiar as some people with the sitewide content...but I did spend a lot of time on the core vs. supplemental. I don't know why I struggled with it because it didn't say you had to do anything different for the 2, but I think I know enough to be dangerous and found myself thinking that those terms are important and wanting to define them.
  - MN: What do you think of when you think of "core" vs. "supplemental"?
 - SC: Same as Beth..."housing" is core. 
 - EW: A little confused. Is "core" something everyone is given almost as a default vs. "supplemental" is something based on your unique circumstances? 
 - RH: If there is a specific application or form to fill out, that's considered supplemental.
 - MN: So if the path to get PTSD is just to fill out the 526 again, not a new form, would you consider that supplemental?
 - RH: No, I would not.
 - MN: Do you all feel the same way? (Not sure)
 - BP: I think it's great to hear especially from new folks.  
 
 ## How confident were you in your decision?
 
 - SC: Pretty confident. Maybe more content could be added to all criteria, but I felt confident in my decision.
 - RH: Same. I thought there were parts of pages that could be part of the other section
 - BP: I felt confident, but I also felt like "Wow, this is going to be really hard for people." I think it's great how short the questions are in the spreadsheet. Has to be really short...but I just think it's a really difficult exercise and I wonder how much people will be able to do this on their own without handholding?
 - PS: For one of them, I spent 15 minutes going back and forth...Agent Orange. There was a lot of content there about Agent Orange specifically, but then there was also really helpful info about applying for AO-specific benefits so I really struggled with that.
 - EW: Once I got my mind through these questions, I used the headers to help me...for AO, I wondered what was about the benefit. I was relying on the formatting and the headers. The one that was really hard for me was the dental care page because it linked to the PDF and I didn't know where to put that content. Although I said no for #2, I wasn't sure if it was because the current content 
 - SC: For AO, page intro mentions disability compensation but I feel like it gets lost...I questioned is this the only benefit a Veteran can get based on their exposure (not health care)?
 - EW: It was really in-depth about the conditions, but I wasn't sure at the end what was the benefit to the user.
 - SC: And perhaps some of the content could be put in R&S. Then the page wouldn't be so long and you could concentrate on the benefits.
 - BP: The other thing that's interesting about this exercise is that this isn't the way a content author would be doing this because they're going to have legacy content. Going back to #3, I'm wondering if we could break that out a bit (like "Is there a specific application?" "Is there a different process?").
 - EW: I like that because there's different questions. 
 - SC: Got confused on AO because there was a header about survivors, but no other mention.

## Confidence in decision

EW: 4 (now 3)
BP: 5
SC: 5
RH: 5 (now 4)
PS: 4

RH: After hearing other people's thoughts, I'm thinking it's not as clear. 

## Breaking content apart

PS: I didn't have time. But if I did, I would've split AO into R&S and benefit hub info. Lots of good info on the page, but unwiedly on 1 page so I would've split them.
SC: Even though I agree that the page is long, I'm not sure that the content belongs in R&S because I still feel like the content is "tier 1" because it's for Veterans.
RH: I thought the content around the AO exam, I thought that could be its own article that we could link to from the benefit page. For the PTSD one, I said that you could probably create a PTSD article about the PTSD programs. Right now, there's a link to other site info.
EW: Took me a while to determine core vs. supplemental.

## Looking at content together

### Clothing allowance

MN: Where did you all decide to place this content?

SC, RH, EW: Benefit hub
RH: I thought this one was the clearest. It made perfect sense that it was in the benefit hub.

(Going through questions together)...
- Q1: Everyone answered "Yes."
- Q2: Everyone answered "Yes." Has a lot of possbilities listed.
- Q3: Everyone answered "Yes."
  - RH, PS: Language that said they had to fill out an additional application to get clothing allowance.
  - SC: Also, they have to qualify by a certain date to get payment for that year + they have to go to the VA facility to drop off their application. 
- Q4: Everyone answered "yes." Easy yes.
  - EW: Very clearly laid out what benefit you're getting.
- MN: Did you all stop at this point because it told you where to go?
   - SC: Started to go on, but then stopped.
   - EW: Hard to stop, but once I got to a certain point, I thought, Oh, yeah, that's a benefit.    

### Camp LeJeune

- SC: For benefit hubs. But the title doesn't really speak to the benefit.
- EW: Benefit hub
- RH: Benefit hub
- PS: Benefit hub, but needs a different H1
- BP: Benefit hub. I went onto #5 every time, even though I answered "yes" to 4.

- MN: For criteria 3, what was it that passed that criteria?
 - PS: While they had to file for disability benefits (typical thing), they also have to submit 1 of 2 additional form. That triggered the "Yes" response for me. Very similar to the clothing allowance.

### Overall

### Did anyone put any content in R&S?

- RH: Put dental care one in R&S as it is now. But put note that it should be in benefit hub if you took info from fact sheet + added how you apply and how you do it.
- EW: It's written like it's trying to convince you that it's R&S, but the more you look at it, it feels like benefit hub. So it was tricky to do some investigation on this.
- BP: Different application tricky...maybe that's the main difference.

- RH: Was able to separate totally focusing on the criteria.
- SC: I did think about current placement, especially when it came to dental care. Sparse content, but knew it was obviously a benefit. On PTSD page, page intro was a bit general and wasn't clear that it was for a Veteran so I think I kept existing page in mind when assessing.


### Rating of helpfulness of this type of criteria in determining content placement

(1 to 5)

EW: 4 (I couldn't have made decisions without this)
PS: 5 (I think the document is going to help me make consistent decisions; it's a huge tool that's going to help someone who isn't 100% comfortable with the content 
RH: 4 (Having this criteria will be hugely helpful having it laid out this way)
BP: 4 (helpful, just a little complex)
SC: 4
