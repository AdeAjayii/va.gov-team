# Family and Caregiver Benefit Hub Implementation Plan

## Next steps
- Document scope and design decisions based on research
- Finalize IA design
- Identify any additional research needed
- Audit VFS products impacted by design approach and identify changes needed
- Establish a roll-out approach for the overall structure and individual hubs
- Identify key stakeholders
- Define a communications plan

## Product impacts

### Product teams
- Identify all products impacted by this effort that will require content, design, development, URL changes, and/or redirects

### Sitewide products and components
- Primary nav, home page, benefit hub pages, side nav, search
- Research, design, dev, CMS?
- Top nav
  - Do we want to implement a flyout menu? There isn't one now. Let's revisit the conversation about the 2 column headers for hubs that don't necessarily map to "Get"/"Manage" (like this one and records). Will revisit this. We can do the discovery around the technical lift and then will decide if we try to include this in the launch.
- Hub page
  - For tasks: Don't use teaser text
  - Future: Exploration around adding actual tags pulled from CMS (vs. our "pseudo" tags that are there now) and making them interactive to impact display.
- Benefit detail pages
  - Future: Exploration around dynamically pulling in top Q&As or top R&S pages.

### Resources and support
- Ability to select more than 1 audience - Complete
- Landing page design


## Roll-out approach

Benefits hub pages/forms/tools will be roll-out hub by hub in the following rough approach
- Establish the overall structure needed in the new family member hub and build out appropriate landing pages and links
  - Is it possible to publish this structure with links pointing at the existing placement of all content?
  - Do we only publish the structure supporting a single hub as we work on it or can we launch the full structure?
- Build out new content and modified Veteran content as needed to support and gain stakeholder approval as needed
- Complete any design and development work needed to support moving forms/tools to their new location
- Move any existing content pages
- Implement redirects
