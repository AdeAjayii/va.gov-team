## Benefit hub roll-out

Benefits hub pages/forms/tools will be roll-out hub by hub in the following rough approach
- Establish the overall structure needed in the new family member hub and build out appropriate landing pages and links
  - Is it possible to publish this structure with links pointing at the existing placement of all content?
  - Do we only publish the structure supporting a single hub as we work on it or can we launch the full structure?
- Build out new content and modified Veteran content as needed to support and gain stakeholder approval as needed
- Complete any design and development work needed to support moving forms/tools to their new location
- Move any existing content pages
- Implement redirects
