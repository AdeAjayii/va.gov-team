# Initiative Brief: Family member benefit hub expansion
#### Overview

The VA.gov family member benefit hub has served as a front door to core benefit information for family members since the 2018 VA.gov redesign. But the deeper benefit information lives scattered amongst the benefit hubs. Research shows that family members are going to the hub for their information and communication efforts across VA are aiming to bring family member information (and specifically survivor information) together to help make it easier for family members to understand and access their benefits.

We're working to bring all family member core benefit content into the family member hub to full streamline and consolidate the benefit experience for this critical audience.

**Goals:**
- This effort to create a single location for family member benefits will make it easier for family members to find, understand, and use information about their benefits. By pulling family member benefits out of the Veteran benefit hubs, this effort will also help to streamline the Veteran benefit experience and reduce the cognitive burden of links and content in those hubs.


**Product(s) impacted**
- Family member hub
- Benefit hubs
- Resources and support

## Problems to solve

**Problem Defined:**
Family and caregiver benefit content, applications, and tasks are distributed across the Veteran benefit hubs.  Furthermore, tools related to managing health care and benefits are mostly framed up for the Veteran, but often also intended for family members and caregivers to use.
  
* Evidence to support Prolem:
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
  - Streamline the IA
 

## Desired User Outcomes
- As a family member and/or caregiver of a Veteran, I can easily
  - find and learn about the benefits and services available to me
  - apply online or understand how to apply for the benefits and services available to me
  - access tools to manage my health care and benefits I am receiving through VA

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Family members or caregivers of Veterans
  - are unable to find information and applications for the benefits and services avilable to them
  - are unable to find the tools that allow them to manage their health care and benefits they receive through VA
  - 

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Increased use of family member benefits and services


## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Increased calls from family members and caregivers unable to find benefit content and tasks

## Discovery

### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 

- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Family members will continue to look for benefits information in the Veteran hubs more the family member hub (this is the current state)
  - Family members will get lost once sent into the Veteran hubs for certain tasks and applications
  - Organization of the family member hub may make it difficult to find benefits that pertain to the visitor (i.e. benefits specific to parents or survivors)
  - Loss of SEO with changes in placement, titles, and URLs
 
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
 

- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements 

 
  - 
### Solution Scope

**In Scope**
- Moving Drupal content pages from Veteran benefit hub to family member hub and implementing URL changes
- Moving applications from Veteran benefit hubs to family member hub and implementing URL changes
- Moving pages and segments of content to Resources and support

**Not In Scope**
