# Synthesis of existing data and research

## Background and purpose

As we look at the idea of a more robust family member and caregiver benefit hub and plan for research, we wanted to review current analytics, past research, and any other qualitative data we have around the existing family member and caregiver experience. 

This file contains information on the following
1. [Data pulled from analytics and search data](#analytics)
2. [Related findings from past research efforts](#research)
3. [Summary of Medallia and call center data](#callcenter)

### YoY Performance of the [Family member benefits hub page](https://www.va.gov/family-member-benefits)

Year | Page views | Unique page views (%) | Entrances (%) | Bounce rate | Exit rate | Time on page
--- | ---| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
2019 | 663,259 |	 389,612 (58.74%)	| 124,970 	(18.84%)| 35.46%	| 17.35% |	1:14
2020 | 1,063,499 |	 810,571 	(76.22%)	| 363,212 	(34.15%)	| 40.23%	| 26.37%	| 1:45
2021 | 1,188,723 |	 930,011 	(78.24%)	| 346,858 	(29.18%)	| 39.46%	| 23.77% |	1:48
2022	| 1,610,120 	| 1,112,459 	(69.09%)	| 385,145 	(23.92%)	| 7.63%	| 20.02%	| 1:28
2023	| 1,803,110 |	 751,674 	(41.69%)	| 248,439 	(13.78%)	| 0.81%	| 12.44%	| :50


Notes: 
- In 2022: There was a steep decline in bounce rate from Feb (38.93%) to March (10.3%) to April (0.73%); Other hubs also saw this decline, ebenefits and myhealth did not; seems to be isolated to modernized va.gov pages
- In2023: Spike of traffic in March (3x) and April (2x) - this correlates to spikes across the site that do not have an explanation; no spikes in august to correlate with PACT signing or deadline; small spike on Feb 2, 2023
