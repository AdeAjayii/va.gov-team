## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we continue to move toward an omnichannel experience and multilingual content, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language about VA payments, debts, and copay bills. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document.

| **benefit overpayment / overpayment** | We use this term to describe when VA pays a Veteran too much money related to a VA benefit (such as disability, education, or pension benefits). | Use "benefit overpayment" on first mention and "overpayment" for all subsequent mentions. In spaces with limited character counts, just "overpayments" is okay. | [VA debt management resources and support page](https://www.va.gov/resources/va-debt-management/) (Q&A on "Why do I owe VA money?") | Not yet in style guide | 9.30.22 |
