## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA.gov helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we move toward preparing for translation, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language about VA appointments. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document.

| outstanding debt | This is a debt that the Veteran currently owes to VA. We currently use this terminology for headers within MyVA and the VA mobile app. |  |
| payment | This is a payment that VA makes to the Veteran. We also use the plural version of this term (**Payments**) as the top-level category to house debts and payment history in the VA mobile app. The term has tested well in past IA research and we'll continue to test it as a category header moving forward. |  |

How participants defined copays, debt, and bills:
Copay:	Participants defined copays in relation to money owed for medical related expenses
“A copay is when you’re paying whatever insurance doesn’t cover for service that you had.”
Debt:	Participants defined debt as money owed, usually through overpayment from VA
“Bill is something that is due now. Debt is money you owe, debt is something you owe from the past.”
“Debt is an overpayment that I owe them back.”
Bill:	Most participants defined bills as similar to debt, as money owed and many viewed it as a statement for money owed
“Bills being a request for me to pay my liable for my debt to the VA.”
