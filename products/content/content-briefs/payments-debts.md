## Overview
Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA.gov helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. As we move toward preparing for translation, consistency becomes even more important.  

This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards and that uses consistent language about VA appointments. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned across channels. This is a living document.
