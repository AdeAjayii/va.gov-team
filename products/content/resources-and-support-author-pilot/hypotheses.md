# Hypotheses

- Clear “content eligibility criteria” for R&S content and a content planning group that reviews proposals for R&S articles will help to ensure that R&S articles are strategic, findable, SEO-friendly, and non-duplicative.
- A content checklist  (and a final manual review by the VA.gov content team for now at least for now) will ensure that R&S articles meet at least the minimum VA.gov content and accessibility standards. We want to find out how much of this work needs to be done by the content team vs., for example, a SiteImprove or the CMS or another tool so that we can better inform next steps in training and support. Automating checklist and QA isn’t in scope; will be manual for now.
- Feedback data and analytics will allow the VA.gov content team to determine which R&S articles aren’t performing well and engage in regular comprehension testing to make targeted improvements.
- We will need to add tags and will likely need to revisit the tagging structure to effectively support  
- Veterans and other beneficiaries will face navigational challenges between the benefit hubs and R&S articles without an explicit "Go back to last page" path between the 2.
- We will incur content, design, and technical debt as we move forward with existing R&S templates because we know that we ultimately want to structure content for greater flexibility and reuse.
