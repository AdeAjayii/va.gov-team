# Resources and Support non-OCTO author pilot hypotheses

**Note:** We don’t have existing training materials or knowledge management articles specific to R&S. Therefore, the pilot is designed to be a very close collaboration between the OCTO content team and the pilot participants. The OCTO content team can help bridge the gap with training, as we plan on working with content authors hand in hand. For example, we plan to hold the following:
 - Content template and structure discussions as part of the content planning group process, where we discuss content strategy for articles.
 - Content creation sessions where we work directly with the content authors to create articles and talk through questions, things we’ve learned authoring content, etc.
 - Checklist review sessions where our copy editor goes through the content checklist with the content author before publishing.

## Hypothesis 1: Clear “content eligibility criteria” for R&S content and a content planning group that reviews proposals for R&S articles will help to ensure that R&S articles are strategic, findable, SEO-friendly, and non-duplicative.

### What we want to learn:
- Are there points of confusion/“gray areas” in the eligibility criteria?
- How can we make the intake and planning process as easy and smooth as possible?
- How big of a burden is this work on the members of the content planning group?
- What size group is most effective for a content planning group to offer needed guidance while keeping workflows moving?
- What will be the best way to ensure appropriate crosslinking to new/updated R&S articles (for example, from the benefit hubs)?
- What challenges does the group face as they do this work? 

## Hypothesis 2: As the volume of R&S articles grows, we’ll need to create an easier way for the content planning group to track and search the article library.

### What we want to learn:

## Hypothesis 3: A content checklist (and a final manual review by the VA.gov content team for now at least for now) will ensure that R&S articles meet the minimum VA.gov content and accessibility standards.

### What we want to learn: 
- How much of this work needs to be done through manual review vs., for example, a SiteImprove or the CMS or another tool in the future?
- What’s easy vs. confusing in the checklist?
- How much of the checklist do/can content authors complete themselves vs. the OCTO copy editor needing to change and/or guide authors through? 

## Hypothesis 4: Feedback data and analytics will allow the VA.gov content team to determine which R&S articles aren’t performing well and engage in regular comprehension testing to make targeted improvements.

## Hypothesis 5: We need to revisit the existing tag/category structure to better set up R&S for growth.  In addition, the tags will need to be continually evaluated as content is added (i.e., we may need to add new tags).

## Hypothesis 6: Veterans and other beneficiaries will face navigational challenges between the benefit hubs and R&S articles without an explicit "Go back to last page" path between the 2.
- Do specific types of articles cause more navigational confusion than others?
- As we streamline benefit hubs and rely more on crosslinking between hubs and R&S, how much do people use those crosslinks from the benefit hubs and at what points during the application flow?
- What CTA guidance and/or "rules" can we create to ensure that crosslinks are as helpful and effective as possible? For example, does every R&S article that relates directly to a VA benefit have to have 2 CTAs (1 to the benefit application and 1 to the benefit hub "About" page)?

## Hypothesis 7: We will incur content, design, and technical debt as we move forward with existing R&S templates because we know that we ultimately want to structure content for greater flexibility and creat-once-publish-everywhere (COPE) reuse.

### What we want to learn:
- What can we do now with the content types/components we have to help restructure content for better reuse in the future?
