## Step 1: Determine if and where your content belongs in the Veteran benefit experience

Use our content placement criteria to determine if your content belongs in the Veteran benefit content experience. If the content you're evaluating has multiple pieces to it (for example, eligibility criteria for a VA benefit + related questions and answers about eligibility), use the criteria to evaluate each piece of content on its own.

Does your content meet both of these requirements?
- [ ] Content speaks directly to Veterans, service members, or family members, **and**
- [ ] Content directly supports a Veteran, service member, or family member in discovering, applying for, tracking, managing, or using a VA benefit or service

If yes, your content belongs in the Veteran benefit experience. If not, your content may belong somewhere else within the VA content ecosystem.

Now, use our additional content placement criteria to determine if your content's primary home should be a VA.gov benefit hub or the VA.gov Resources and Support section.

Does your content meet this requirement?
- [ ] Content supports a benefit that has a unique application or application process that results in the beneficiary receiving a core or supplemental benefit.

**And** does your content provide an overview of one of these topics?
- [ ] A tool needed to manage or use the benefit or service, **or**
- [ ] What the person gets with the benefit (including current compensation rates), **or**
- [ ] Eligibility, **or**
- [ ] Instructions on how to apply

If yes, your content's primary home should be in a VA.gov benefit hub. Contact the VA.gov content team...

If no, your content's primary home should be in Resources and Support. Move to Step 2.
