# Creating new content in the VA.gov Veteran benefit experience

## Step 1: Determine if and where your content belongs in the Veteran benefit experience

Use our content placement criteria to determine if your content belongs in the Veteran benefit content experience. If the content you're evaluating has multiple pieces to it, use the criteria to evaluate each piece of content on its own. For example, if you're evaluating a page that contains eligibility criteria for a VA benefit as well as related questions and answers about eligibility, evaluate the eligibility criteria and each Q&A separately.

### Does your content meet both of these requirements?
- [ ] Content speaks directly to Veterans, service members, or family members, **and**
- [ ] Content directly supports a Veteran, service member, or family member in discovering, applying for, tracking, managing, or using a VA benefit or service

**If no,** your content doesn't belong in the Veteran benefit experience. It may belong somewhere else within the VA content ecosystem.

**If yes,** your content belongs in the Veteran benefit experience. Use this additional content criteria question to determine if your content's primary home should be a VA.gov benefit hub or the VA.gov Resources and Support section.

### Does your content meet both of these requirements?

- [ ] Content supports a benefit that has a unique application or application process that results in the beneficiary receiving a core or supplemental VA benefit. 

**And** content provides an overview with basic, high-level information about one of these topics:
- [ ] A tool needed to manage or use the benefit or service, **or**
- [ ] What the person gets with the benefit (including current compensation rates), **or**
- [ ] Top-level benefit eligibility, **or**
- [ ] Instructions on how to apply

**If yes,** your content's primary home should be in a VA.gov benefit hub. Contact the VA.gov content team...

**If no,** your content's primary home may be in Resources and Support. Use the question below to make sure.

### Does your content meet at least one of these goals?

- [ ] Provides supplemental eligibility, evidence information, or application instructions for a benefit, **or**
- [ ] Explains ways to use a VA benefit,**or**
- [ ] Provides more information about a specific program, service, or sub-benefit that a person can use after they apply for a VA benefit, **or**
- [ ] Provides a brief overview and link to more information about a Veteran benefit from another government agency (like DoD), **or**
- [ ] Provides support for signing into and using VAâ€™s digital tools, **or**
- [ ] Answers a question that Veterans, service members, or family members have about VA benefits and services (based on contact center reports, search data, and user feedback)

**If yes,** your content's primary home should be in Resources and Support.

**If no,** contact the VA.gov content team to talk about where your content should live.

## Step 2: Make sure your content is unique

Search the [Resources and Support article list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/resources-and-support/resources-and-support-article-list.md) to make sure there isn't already content on this topic. If there is existing content that is identical or similar to the content you'd like to propose, review the content. If you'd like to propose changes or additions to the content, contact the VA.gov content team.

## Step 3: Choose your template

Before you write content for Resources and Support, you'll need to choose a template. Some Resources and Support templates offer more flexibility, while others have a limited number of components to choose from and stricter character counts. Following the template from the start will help you avoid needing to go back and rewrite content to fit the template when you go into Drupal to build the content.

Resources and Support offers these templates:

- **Step-by-step template:** Choose this template if your content describes a process that has a series of steps that must happen in order.
- **Checklist template:** Choose this template if your content describes a collection of items that the person must have or gather, or a collection of steps that don't need to occur in order.
- **About template:** Choose this template if your content will provide Veterans or other beneficiaries information that fits together in a cohesive flow. _Add more guidance on About templates_
- **Single Q&As and multiple FAQs:** [Read our guidance on FAQs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/content-patterns-and-standards/faqs.md)
- **Media list:** Choose this template if you need to provide a collection of images on a related topic.
- **Video list:** Choose this template if you need to provide a collection of videos on a related topic. 

## Step 4: Determine your H1 page header

Here's how to determine your H1:
- Do your search engine optimization (SEO) research and/or check contact center data. Try to include a keyword or phrase that people are using to talk about this topic in your H1.
- Do a search on VA.gov using your proposed H1. This will help you double check that there isn't already existing or similar content. 
- Follow the VA.gov content style guide guidance for H1s.

## Step 4: Submit your Resources and Support content intake form

## Step 7: Send your draft content for SME review

Depending on your workflow, send either the Word doc template of your article or a preview link of the content in its final presentation, or both. It's often helpful to send the preview link to help SMEs visualize how the content will actually appear to site visitors. Ask SMEs to review the content for accuracy only. If SMEs have questions about plain language edits, please feel free to contact the VA.gov content team for support. Content on VA.gov needs to meet both SME accuracy approval and VA.gov content standards for plain language, style, and voice.

## Step 8: Submit your content for final pre-publication review

Send these 2 items to the VA.gov content team:
- A link to the preview article
- A note about your results from the [content checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/checklists/content-checklist.md). If you have questions related to the content checklist, include these when you send the content.

The VA.gov content team will review the article against the checklist. We'll contact you to set up time to go over any questions or concerns.

**Turnaround time:** 3 days

## Step 9: Send a preview of the content to SMEs for awareness and final sign off

SMEs should always have the opportunity to review content in its final form for awareness. Send a preview link of the content to SMEs. Provide the date for receiving final sign off and any questions or concerns about content. If SMEs have questions about plain language edits, please feel free to contact the VA.gov content team for support.

## Step 10: Publish content and add it to the article list

Once the date has passed for sign-off, or earlier if you have sign-off from SMEs, publish your article. Then add the article to the [Resources and Support article list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/resources-and-support/resources-and-support-article-list.md).
