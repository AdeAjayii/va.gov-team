# VA.gov health content management and considerations

The goal of this document is to provide additional clarity around health content management on VA.gov for all OCTO teams working on health-related products.

## Get benefits section

This section includes content about the following topics:
- About VA health benefits
- Eligibility
- How to apply [with the 10-10EZ application itself in react]
- After you apply
- Family health benefits

All of the content in the "Get benefits" section (outside of the actual 10-10EZ) is managed by the VA.gov content team and owned by a mix of the following teams:

- VA.gov content team
- VHA digital media
- With significant collaboration with other VHA teams and SMEs (such as member enrollment)

Notes for consideration:
- Some of the deeper content in this section will likely move into the Resources and support section of the site in the future. 
- The VA.gov content team and VHA digital will continue to own this content and must be full strategic and decisionmaking partners in any restructuring or rewriting.
- The VA.gov content team must maintain the ability to independently change, remove, or add content in this section and to publish updates immediately when needed for urgent requests (i.e., the team cannot be blocked by the daily deploy for publishing). 
- This is the vital benefit content slated for translation. We must take that into account when discussing changes around IA and content in this section.

## Manage benefits section

This section includes mainly landing pages to online tools that currently live in different places:

- VA online scheduling (tool lives on VA.gov and Cerner's My VA Health)
- Prescription refill, secure messages, lab and test results, medical records (tool live on MHV and Cerner)
- Order hearing aid batteries, order prosthetic socks (tool live on VA.gov)
- Travel pay (tool lives on BTSSS, from AccessVA, though goal is to move to VA.gov)
- Get a Veteran health identification card (tool lives on AccessVA)
- Update your health benefits information (not an online tool)

The VA.gov content team currently manages this content. The content is owned by the VA.gov content team and relevant product partners/SMEs. We will need to decide who is responsible for actively managing this content once the health apartment is live and how that team will work with the different SMEs. 

This section also includes the **COVID-19 vaccine mini-hub**. The VA.gov content team owns and manages this content (in partnership with our clinical SMEs). This content is regularly updated in 3 different languages (English, Spanish, and Tagalog). The content team must have easy access to independently change (and even add pages to) this content and to publish immediately when needed for urgent requests (i.e., the team cannot be blocked by the daily deploy for publishing). 

This section also currently includes content about **paying your VA copay bill** that links to a tool that lives on VA.gov. However, the future state of this is a combined debt tool. The "Pay your VA copay bill" link will link out of the health hub and over to a combined debt experience under "va.gov/manage-va-debt." This content is owned by:
- VA.gov content team
- The debt management center
- VHA finance

In the near future, there will be a va.gov/manage-va-debt landing page that links to the combined debt tool + a page on requesting help with debt that links to a combined FSR tool. Supplemental content will live in Resources and support (as some does already now).

 ### More resources section
 
 This section includes **copay rates**. These rates will likely move into the main **Get benefits** section based on analytics showing rates as one of the most highly trafficked pages.
 
 The rest of the content in this section will likely move into Resources and support based on ongoing content placement strategy work. 
 
 ### Future health content in Resources and support
 
 The sitewide crew is actively working on migration plans for health content and much of that content will likely go into Resources and Support, with the understanding that R&S is an MVP product and will need continual monitoring, evaluation, and iteration.
 
 The goal is to open Resources and Support content management to more program office teams across VA, with the VA.gov content team and VHA digital media providing strategic guidance and governance. must maintain the ability to independently change, remove, or add content in this section and to publish updates immediately when needed for urgent requests. 
 
 ### Future health condition and patient education content
 
 VHA is engaged in a significant effort to restructure and improve health condition and patient education content. At this time, there is no specific location identified for this content. However, any discussions around it must start in the context of this overall effort.
