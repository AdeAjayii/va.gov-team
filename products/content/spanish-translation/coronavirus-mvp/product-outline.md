## Overview
We'll create a step-by-step approach to localization that will provide essential COVID-19 content about VA health care and benefits in Spanish while allowing us to quickly gather data and user feedback that will help to inform a sustainable localization solution for digital content.

## Problem Statement
Veterans and their family members who are low English proficiency (LEP) or who are more comfortable reading information in their primary language don't have easy and consistent access to translated content online.

VA has guidance for complying with federal law around providing meaningful access to information for people with low English proficiency exists. But VA currently doesn't currently have a localization program and doesn't prioritize localization of digital content in a programmatic and sustainable way. Translated materials are available, but they are scattered and there is no current organization-wide program to ensure that the most important content is translated or that translated content is kept accurate and up-to-date. 

We also don't have a full understanding of our low English proficiency audience, including the number of users who may need or want translated content, what languages they most need, their health literacy needs, and what their other needs might be so that we can ensure that our translated content delivers the greatest value that it can.

VHA is being asked by Congress to provide translated content in Spanish. We want to help meet the immediate need and demonstrate progress while also working toward an effective and sustainable approach for the future.

How might we meet these 3 important, but potentially disparate goals, at the same time? 
1. Begin to provide essential content for our LEP Veterans and family members
2. Demonstrate to Congress that VHA and the wider VA are making progress on direction to provide content in Spanish
3. Quickly gather the data, user feedback, and audience research information we need to recommend an effective and sustainable organization-wide localization program
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans and their family members and caregivers can get the information they need in the language most comfortable for them (first Spanish, then other languages as identified).
- Low English proficiency (LEP) Veterans and their family members and caregivers can better understand VA benefits and services so they can access the care, benefits, and services they need.
- VHA will demonstrate to Congress that they are providing essential COVID-19 information in Spanish, and are making progress toward the goal of a sustainable localization program.

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Veterans and family members are confused by low-quality machine translation.
- Veterans and family members can't easily find or use translated content.
