## Designing for translation: A Digital.gov multilingual and content web managers community meeting 

### Design guidance

- Take a comprehensive approach to language. Who needs to know this information? Would non-English speaking groups benefit from it? If yes, what languages are needed? Plan your content with these answers in mind.
- Design with the differences in languages in mind: 
  - Text length (or text swell), with romance languages taking up 15% to 20% more room
  - Text direction and special characters (people scan the way they read): https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/
  - Decide on a style for dates and numbers and stick to it to avoid confusion (refer to the USA.gov bilingual style guide for dates and money style)
- Avoid idioms
- Don't provide a customer experience where the customer has to go through the English website to get to the Spanish (or other language) site. Offer them a dedicated URL. Otherwise, Google will not find the content and users won't be able to bookmark the page. Use international convention for URLs.
- In translation contracts, put in a clause stating that translations must be done in the U.S. Otherwise, you may produce content that is not culturally relevant or is even offensive.
- Write in plain language and prepare your content for translation. The more you help your translators, the better your translation will be and the less it will cost.
- Layout and imagery:
  - Allow space for the text to fit in the layout. Consider designing for longer languages first. (Consider this for buttons, H1s, etc!)
  -	Take into account the direction of the text.
-	Use international symbols. 
-	For images – think about culture. Do they convey the same meaning in different cultures?
-	Beware of automatic hyphenation
