# Localization discovery: Meetings and interviews

### MedlinePlus en español
Met with head of Medline Plus and lead for bilingual content

- Have a Language Access Committee.

- Refer to Real Academia Espanola (https://www.rae.es/), the gold standard for proper Spanish.

- Many sites use Google translate first. If you start with machine first, usually your product is somewhat machine line. We have humans involved from the start. When we go back to technology, we do it to confirm, little nuances of cultural, grammar checks. But ideally it does start and end with a human set of eyes with technology in the middle. 

- With a contemporary subject (like COVID-19), we'll look at other government sites to see how they're talking about it. It's painfully obvious when they use machine translation.

- Full Spanish team is 2 FTEs. We have some original content that we translate, but the bulk of our content is licensed. As part of the licensed content, we require that it comes to us in 2 languages. We then do original translations for the health topic summaries.

- For licensed content, we know that it goes through people as well. From time to time, we encounter terms that are more regional so we have to edit into more universal Spanish.

- The more translators you have look at content, the better. This brings different perspectives. For the most part, we take on translations across the board in a team effort. Either my colleague initiates and I polish or vice versa. Try to have 2 people look at it. Sometimes debate and discuss to collaborate on final product. Sometimes have to go outside agency to see how others are talking about a topic. Collaboration is key. 

- When we make updates in English, it prompts an immediate reaction on the Spanish side. We don't view translation as an "extra" step. It is an integral part of the task. We hold the release of content until both English and Spanish are ready.





## Designing for translation: A Digital.gov multilingual and content web managers community meeting 

### Design guidance

- Take a comprehensive approach to language. Who needs to know this information? Would non-English speaking groups benefit from it? If yes, what languages are needed? Plan your content with these answers in mind.
- Design with the differences in languages in mind: 
  - Text length (or text swell), with romance languages taking up 15% to 20% more room
  - Text direction and special characters (people scan the way they read): https://www.w3.org/International/articles/inline-bidi-markup/
  - Decide on a style for dates and numbers and stick to it to avoid confusion (refer to the USA.gov bilingual style guide for dates and money style)
- Avoid idioms
- Don't provide a customer experience where the customer has to go through the English website to get to the Spanish (or other language) site. Offer them a dedicated URL. Otherwise, Google will not find the content and users won't be able to bookmark the page. Use international convention for URLs.
- In translation contracts, put in a clause stating that translations must be done in the U.S. Otherwise, you may produce content that is not culturally relevant or is even offensive.
- Write in plain language and prepare your content for translation. The more you help your translators, the better your translation will be and the less it will cost.
- Layout and imagery:
  - Allow space for the text to fit in the layout. Consider designing for longer languages first. (Consider this for buttons, H1s, etc!)
  -	Take into account the direction of the text.
-	Use international symbols. 
-	For images – think about culture. Do they convey the same meaning in different cultures?
-	Beware of automatic hyphenation
