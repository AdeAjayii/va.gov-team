# Decision Log – Benefit Content Model

## Purpose of document: 

Record what considerations have contributed to the evolution of a "hardened" Benefit Content Model. This will enable via a COPE model (create once publish everywhere) centralized benefit content to be made available to a growing array of presentation layers – VA.gov website, virtual agent, mobile app, etc.

## Background

### Need for a hardened benefit content model (BCM)

As Veteran-facing presentation layers grow, keeping content in sync across more places has become difficult. The Drupal CMS is intended to provide that source of truth for Veteran-facing content. However, content must be structured to enable apps to pull the content they need. The current state, which does not serve this purpose, has the Benefit Hub pages themselves being the source of truth for benefits. Applications can't pull any particular aspect of that content for specific purposes.

Applications for structured content
- Virgual agent (chatbot)
- Facilities pages on VA.gov, which tell Veterans what services (benefits) they can receive at a given facility
- Mobile app
- Benefit hubs on VA.gov
