# Problem Brief Template


### Situation
_Describe the current-state of your problem and the environment in which it exists._

- The benefit hubs were launched as part of the WBC effort in November of 2018. 
- The structure and majority of the content was largely ported over from Vets.gov and augmented by additional content pages migrated from legacy Team site pages. 
- Over the 3 years the benefit hubs have been live, we have continued to add and modify content. 
- The structure and organization of the content has not been reviewed to ensure it still meets the needs of our users. 
 

### Complication(s)

- There is still legacy content that is marked for migration to the benefit hubs. 
- We have a number of larger strategic efforts coming up that rely on having established content types and templates, and a stable content structure:
  - Content translation - any large structural or reorganizational changes should be complete prior to major translation efforts
  - R&S strategy - we need clear guidelines on what types of content should move into R&S
  - Authenticated exp IA - 
  - Health care apartment - 
  - COPE content -

- Can the structure of the benefit hubs be templatized?
- Can the content of the benefit hubs be simplified, or, reduced? 
- Can we determine if certain types of content should be moved over to Resources and support?
