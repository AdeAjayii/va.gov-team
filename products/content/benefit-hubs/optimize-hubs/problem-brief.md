# Problem Brief Template


### Situation
_Describe the current-state of your problem and the environment in which it exists._

- Benefit hubs were launched as part of the WBC effort in November of 2018.  
- Over the 3 years the benefit hubs have been live, we have continued to add and modify content. 
- We have not reviewed or evaluated the performance of the structure and the content to ensure it still meets the needs of our users. 
 

### Complication(s)
_Describe what’s changed and how it impacts your team._\
_Leverage techniques like 5 Why’s_ 

We have a number of larger strategic efforts coming up that would greatly benefit from established content types and templates, and a stable content structure
- Content translation, R&S strategy, authenticated exp IA, health care apartment, and COPE content.


### Question(s)
_What’s the fundamental question you are going  to answer?_ 

- How might we optimize the existing benefit hubs to set us up for success for upcoming strategic initiatives and continue to support our users in getting and managing their benefits?  
- Can the structure of the benefit hubs be templatized?
- Can the content of the benefit hubs be simplified, or, reduced?
  - If so, what content can be moved over to Resources and support?

### Answer(s)
_How will the problem be solved and what evidence do we have that it will._ 
_How will you know the problem is solved? What data will you look for?_

- Evaluate the current structure of each benefit hub and identify inconsistencies
- Review analytics and SEO data to evaluate how core pages in the hubs are performing

### Context

_You see a problem. Perhaps it’s a problem you face or it’s a problem that affects your team. Typically, you bring these topics up in retros or you raise them with leads or you try to solve them yourself._

_But, you don’t always see improvement._

_One reason is we only address surface-level problems. This may be because resources are easier to come by for “simpler” solutions. Another reason is that as our orgs (DEPO, VSA, Platform, etc.) scale, issues affect more than just you or your team._

_This takes time and energy implementing idea after idea. Not to mention, there are likely a lot of other problems the org must prioritize against, which makes convincing others an uphill climb._

_So, how do we make it easier to prioritize problems our teams face?_

_We need to write things down. We need to take the time to document our thoughts and describe our ideas before presenting a problem so that it’s easier to understand and prioritize. Our approach here is to follow the SCQA framework._

_When might you use the template?:_
- _Tackling large submission payloads and its impacts on the user experience_
- _Addressing accessibility across multiple teams_
- _Improving how your team intakes requests_
- _Decreasing the time it takes for content to be published on VA.gov_

### Example

- Another example _Note: Example is for illustrative purposes only. Please don’t plan vacations this way unless you really want to._
  - _We visit a new city every summer…_
  - _But recently, the size of our group’s gotten bigger…_
  - _And it’s harder to find room/board that meets our needs…_
  - _Not to mention expenses..._
  - _How do we find a place to stay that has all of the amenities we want within our budget?_
  - _Answer_
    - _We’re going to organize and categorize the places we might like to visit_
    - _We’re going to research housing on VRBO and Airbnb_
