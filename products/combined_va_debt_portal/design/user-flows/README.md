# Combined VA Debt Portal User Flows

## Iteration 1 - Sprint 66/67

### Flow

![Iteration 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_va_debt_portal/design/user-flows/Iteration%201%20user%20flow.png "Iteration One")

### Outcomes and feedback

This first iteration sought to visually represent the various entrypoint and paths a Veteran could take depending on what their task related to. 

### Key takeaways from presentation to DMC stakeholder 

- The different entrypoints make sense, however we need to be cognizant of Veterans who enter the tool directly to VHA copays or VBA debts and alert them if they have other debt/bills 
- The overview page needs to provide more detail
   - Congress is expecting a 'full debt portfolio' 
   - We should incorporate total amounts for debt + copays and validate this decision through research
