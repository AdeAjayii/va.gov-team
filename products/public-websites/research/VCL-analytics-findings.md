## Overview
The Veterans Crisis Line (VCL) is a special link that's displayed at the top of every modernized VA.gov page, as well as in the footer (show screenshot). When a user clicks on one of these links, a modal dialog box opens with various ways to get in touch (show screenshot). What follows is a summary of currently available analytics on the Veterans Crisis Line on the VA.gov site.

## Research Questions
