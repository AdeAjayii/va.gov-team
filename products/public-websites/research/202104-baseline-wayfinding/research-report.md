## Key Findings
The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form". See an example of this section [on the Caregiver findings document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/usability-testing-jan2020/research-findings.md).

List details of each finding in top findings here, with supporting quotes when possible.

Difficulty with 3 tasks...
3. Find the form to fill out to say that you want someone to be your representative in your disability claim appeal (form 21-22a)
- 10 participants were looking for a place to find forms under "top 4 forms" > Disability and couldn't find it
- 3 participants had difficulty searching on the Find a Form page due to too many words in search query, resulting in no relevant results
- 2 participants mispelled "representative" on the Find a Form page, resulting in no relevant results

5. Set up your travel to medical appointments to be reimbursed by direct deposit (direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement)
- 4 were looking for "travel" in the healthcare section of VA Benefits and Health Care or in the "top 4" boxes
- 2 didn't notice the direct deposit link on the travel pay reimbursement page

8. Share VA medical history with a doctor outside the VA (get your VA medical records)
- 3 participants missed the CTA button at the top of the medical records page and got confused by Veterans Health Information Exchange pages re opting out
- 2 people were looking for medical records under health care, not records (maybe add a second link?)
- 2 people thought you couldn't send your VA medical records to an outside doctor or not sure how to do
