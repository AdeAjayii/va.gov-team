## Research Goals 
The purpose of this research is to get a baseline understanding of how the current VA.gov website is being used by Veterans and others. With a better understanding of Veterans' pain points and successes while using VA.gov, we can make more informed decisions about priorities for future research and design work in website navigation and tools.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on April 26 - May 5, 2021. Participants were asked about their past usage of the VA.gov site, and then were given some common Veteran tasks as wayfinding prompts to explore the live VA.gov website. Wayfinding was assessed in terms of participants' success in doing the following typical Veteran tasks:
1. Ask your VA doctor a followup question (send a secure message)
1. Find out if your disability claim has been approved (track claim status)
1. Find the form to fill out to say that you want someone to be your representative in your disability claim appeal (form 21-22a Appointment of Individual As Claimant's Representative)
1. Update your bank information for disability compensation payments (change direct deposit)
1. Set up your travel to medical appointments to be reimbursed by direct deposit (direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement)
1. Find nearest VA hospital to a city you're planning to visit (find a VA location)
1. Get a document that shows the income you receive from the VA (download benefit letter or payment history)
1. Share VA medical history with a doctor outside the VA (get your VA medical records)
1. Tell the VA about your new spouse (add dependent)

We also explored analytics data to see where people click on the VA.gov home page, and we compared these usage statistics with observations from the research sessions.

### Who we talked to

We talked to **13** participants:
- 12 Veterans, including one who was also a caregiver for another Veteran
- 1 family member of a Veteran

Participants were on a variety of devices:
- 8 on a desktop/laptop computer
- 4 on a smartphone
- 1 on a tablet

Participant demographics:
- 9 had no college degree; 4 had a degree
- 7 lived in rural/remote locations; 6 in major metro areas
- 6 were age 55-64 or older; 1 was under 35
- 4 were people of color
- 3 were female
- 3 had a cognitive disability
- 2 had never used VA.gov before
- 1 used a screen reader

One of the sessions was cut short due to technology issues, so most of the findings come from only 12 of the sessions.

### Research Questions
- How do Veterans accomplish a list of common tasks?
  - Where do they typically start? (Google/Facebook/MHV/eBenefits/contact center call or email/VA.gov)
  - If not using VA.gov, why? (e.g., don't know about it, too hard to use)
  - What do they typically do on VA.gov? What tools have they tried using?
- Do they find what they're looking for? If not, what were they looking for?
- What pain points are there in terms of findability and usage?
- What works well?
- What differences are there for desktop *vs.* smartphone users?
- What differences are there for people who have cognitive disabilities?
- What differences are there for people who use screen readers?
- What differences are there for people who have used VA.gov before *vs.* haven't used it?
- Do Veterans read/notice/click/comment on the banner content on the home page?

### Hypotheses
- Veterans are focused on what they’re looking for and don’t want to navigate multiple tools unless it helps them get better results.
- Veterans don't care where the information they're looking for is stored, as long as they are able to find it.
- Veterans aren't using all of the current search and browse tools on VA.gov. 	

## Key Findings
The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form". See an example of this section [on the Caregiver findings document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/usability-testing-jan2020/research-findings.md).

6. Finding six
7. Finding seven


## Details of Findings

### Wayfinding successes 

1. All participants were able to successfully complete 3 of the 9 tasks (#2, 1, 4), and most completed 3 more of the tasks (#6, 7, 9).
![task-summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/images/task-summary.png)
3. Most participants used the links in the "top 4" boxes extensively, finding them useful to complete the tasks.
4. Half of the participants used the links in the left nav on content pages.

### Wayfinding Issues
1. **Many participants were unable to successfully complete 3 of the tasks** (#3, 5, 8), the first of which was completed without any assistance by only one participant. Participants couldn't find what they were looking for (form to appoint representative, how to set up direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement, and how to share VA medical history with a doctor outside the VA). Here are some ways that participants got stuck:
    1. For travel reimbursement direct deposit: 2 people were looking for a link about travel in the "top 4" Health care box or under VA Benefits and Health Care dropdown > Health care. ==> *Consider adding "Travel pay reimbursement" to both locations under health care and/or disability.*
    1. For travel reimbursement direct deposit: 2 people who found the [VA travel pay reimbursement page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/get-reimbursed-for-travel-pay/) didn't notice the "Learn how to set up direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement" link. 
    1. 
1. **Navigation paths to complete the tasks were not always straightforward**, which helps explain why not everyone was successful. Here are some of the paths, along with some suggestions for improving them:
    1. To change direct deposit: "Top 4" box Disability > View your payment history > What should I do if I need to change my direct deposit or contact information? Change your information online ==> *Consider adding "Update direct deposit" link to the "top 4" boxes.*
    2. To change direct deposit: "Top 4" box Records > Change your address > Change your VA direct deposit and contact information

1. **The VA.gov home page is long, and a majority of participants (both mobile and desktop) stayed focused on only one part of it (usually the "top 4" boxes), mostly not looking at anything else on the page.** One participant on a smartphone stayed focused on the VA Benefits and Health Care dropdown.

4. Most participants didn't find the *Resources and support* page on their own, though about half found the travel reimbursement direct deposit article via browsing or searching.
5. Most participants didn't find the *Find a VA form* page on their own, but once they saw it, they wanted easier access to it from the top of the home page.
6. Half of the participants never opened the *VA Benefits and Health Care* dropdown. 
7. A third of the participants never scrolled down past the row of images on the home page.

1. No participants started with site search (in the header of the home page), but some went there when they were unable to find any relevant links elsewhere on the home page. Some participants said that they didn't notice *Search* at first, but once they found it, a few used it in later tasks.

1. One older participant (81 years old) had difficulty reading the font of the links in the "top 4" boxes.
2. One participant (and also a pilot participant who was a Veteran) wanted to sign in first when they opened VA.gov ("easier to sign in [first] because it will ask me to later", p11). This participant was asked to proceed without signing in. (Does signing in affect navigation in any way, other than changing the link on the right in the header?) 

### Other usability successes and issues

### Mobile vs. desktop differences

-----------------

Difficulty with 3 tasks...
3. Find the form to fill out to say that you want someone to be your representative in your disability claim appeal (form 21-22a)
- 10 participants were looking for a place to find forms under "top 4 forms" > Disability and couldn't find it
- 3 participants had difficulty searching on the Find a Form page due to too many words in search query, resulting in no relevant results
- 2 participants mispelled "representative" on the Find a Form page, resulting in no relevant results

5. Set up your travel to medical appointments to be reimbursed by direct deposit (direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement)
- 4 were looking for "travel" in the healthcare section of VA Benefits and Health Care or in the "top 4" boxes
- 2 didn't notice the direct deposit link on the travel pay reimbursement page

8. Share VA medical history with a doctor outside the VA (get your VA medical records)
- 3 participants missed the CTA button at the top of the medical records page and got confused by Veterans Health Information Exchange pages re opting out
- 2 people were looking for medical records under health care, not records (maybe add a second link?)
- 2 people thought you couldn't send your VA medical records to an outside doctor or not sure how to do

### Other Usability Successes

1. All of the 5 participants who were shown the *Resources and support* page were able to use it to complete the relevant task. 
1. Two participants noticed typeahead prompts while searching and used them.
1. The VA.gov home page worked well with a screen reader.


### Other Usability Issues

1. Four participants had a lot of difficulty searching on the *Find a VA form* page because they included too many words in the search query and/or misspelled a key word in the query ("representative").
1. Three participants complained about the COVID banner alert they kept seeing.


## Additional Insights
1. Calling the VA is what many participants say they do if they can't find what they're looking for, but many try to avoid this because of long hold times, people unable to answer their questions, and frequent transfers to other people/departments.


## Recommendations
Below are some initial recommendations based on research findings to be discussed and revised with the team: 
1. Since people spend so much time looking at links in the "top 4" boxes, consider adding additional links and/or a "View more" link in each. Additional links to consider are travel pay reimbursement, update direct deposit
