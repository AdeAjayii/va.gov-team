## Research Goals 
The purpose of this research is to get a baseline understanding of how the current VA.gov website is being used by Veterans and others. With a better understanding of Veterans' pain points and successes while using VA.gov, we can make more informed decisions about priorities for future research and design work in website navigation and tools.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on April 26 - May 5, 2021. Participants were asked about their past usage of the VA.gov site, and then were given some common Veteran tasks as wayfinding prompts to explore the live VA.gov website. Wayfinding was assessed in terms of participants' success in doing the following typical Veteran tasks (goal in parentheses):
1. Ask your VA doctor a followup question (send a secure message)
1. Find out if your disability claim has been approved (track claim status)
1. Find the form to fill out to say that you want someone to be your representative in your disability claim appeal (form 21-22a Appointment of Individual As Claimant's Representative)
1. Update your bank information for disability compensation payments (change direct deposit)
1. Set up your travel to medical appointments to be reimbursed by direct deposit (direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement)
1. Find nearest VA hospital to a city you're planning to visit (find a VA location)
1. Get a document that shows the income you receive from the VA (download benefit letter or payment history)
1. Share VA medical history with a doctor outside the VA (get your VA medical records)
1. Tell the VA about your new spouse (add dependent)

We also explored analytics data to see where people click on the VA.gov home page, and we compared these usage statistics with observations from the research sessions.

### Who we talked to

We talked to **13** participants:
- 12 Veterans, including one who was also a caregiver for another Veteran
- 1 family member of a Veteran

Participants were on a variety of devices:
- 8 on a desktop/laptop computer
- 4 on a smartphone
- 1 on a tablet

Participant demographics:
- 9 had no college degree; 4 had a degree
- 7 lived in rural/remote locations; 6 in major metro areas
- 6 were age 55-64 or older; 1 was under 35
- 4 were people of color
- 3 were female
- 3 had a cognitive disability
- 2 had never used VA.gov before
- 1 used a screen reader

One of the sessions was cut short due to technology issues, so most of the findings come from only 12 of the sessions.

### Research Questions
- How do Veterans accomplish a list of common tasks?
  - Where do they typically start? (Google/Facebook/MHV/eBenefits/contact center call or email/VA.gov)
  - If not using VA.gov, why? (e.g., don't know about it, too hard to use)
  - What do they typically do on VA.gov? What tools have they tried using?
- Do they find what they're looking for? If not, what were they looking for?
- What pain points are there in terms of findability and usage?
- What works well?
- What differences are there for desktop *vs.* smartphone users?
- What differences are there for people who have cognitive disabilities?
- What differences are there for people who use screen readers?
- What differences are there for people who have used VA.gov before *vs.* haven't used it?
- Do Veterans read/notice/click/comment on the banner content on the home page?

### Hypotheses
- Veterans are focused on what they’re looking for and don’t want to navigate multiple tools unless it helps them get better results.
- Veterans don't care where the information they're looking for is stored, as long as they are able to find it.
- Veterans aren't using all of the current search and browse tools on VA.gov. 	

## Key Findings
The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form". See an example of this section [on the Caregiver findings document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/usability-testing-jan2020/research-findings.md).

## Details of Findings

### Wayfinding successes 

1. All participants were able to successfully complete 3 of the 9 tasks (#2, 1, 4), and most completed 3 more of the tasks (#6, 7, 9).
![task-summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/images/task-summary.png)
3. Most participants used the links in the "top 4" boxes extensively, finding them useful to complete the tasks.
4. Half of the participants (all desktop users, not mobile) used the links in the left nav on content pages. However, there was one person who thought that there were *too many options* on the content pages with all the left nav links; this person preferred the interface for MHV, which has only a small number of options at the top of the home page.

### Wayfinding Issues
1. **Many participants were unable to successfully complete 3 of the tasks** (#3, 5, 8), the first of which was completed without any assistance by only one participant. Participants couldn't find what they were looking for (form to appoint representative, how to set up direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement, and how to share VA medical history with a doctor outside the VA).  **Navigation paths to complete the tasks were not always straightforward**, which helps explain why not everyone was successful. Here are some of the navigation paths and places where people got stuck, along with some suggestions for improving them:
    3. For form to appoint representative: Two participants looked for forms in the "top 4" disability or records boxes. 
    1. For travel reimbursement direct deposit: 2 people who found the [VA travel pay reimbursement page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/get-reimbursed-for-travel-pay/) didn't notice the "Learn how to set up direct deposit for VA travel pay reimbursement" link. 4 people were looking for a link about travel in the "top 4" Health care box or under VA Benefits and Health Care dropdown > Health care. ==> *Consider adding "Travel pay reimbursement" to both locations under health care and/or disability.*
    1. For medical records: 3 people missed the CTA at the top of the page and got confused by Veterans Health Information Exchange and opting out. 2 people thought you couldn't get your VA medical records to an outside doctor or didn't know how to do that. 2 people thought that medical records would be under health care (not records). ==> Consider adding medical records to the health care "top 4" box.
    1. To change direct deposit: "Top 4" box Disability > View your payment history > What should I do if I need to change my direct deposit or contact information? Change your information online. "Top 4" box Records > Change your address > Change your VA direct deposit and contact information. ==> *Consider adding "Update direct deposit" link to the "top 4" boxes.*
     3. For proof of income: Over half of participants went to "View your payment history". Is there a way to show proof of income from the payment history page? One participant said that "Benefits letters" wasn't the right place to go. Another participant thought that "View payment history" sounded like what they paid the VA, not what the VA paid them.
    4. For add dependent: A third of participants looked in Family Member Benefits (a topic below the pictures) or the "top 4" Records box. ==> *Consider adding "add dependent" to the "top 4" Records box and on the Family Member Benefits page.*  
    5. For find VA location: 2 participants never found the facility locator and instead used site search instead. One typed "Knoxville" and got no relevant results; the other searched "VA in Cincinnati OH" and found results.
    6. For message doctor: One participant was confused about why they would message their doctor from VA.gov when they know they have to go to MHV to do this, as their doctor's office told them. They didn't realize that they could do this from VA.gov. One participant went to the facility locator to find their doctor's office phone number or contact them online. Later they found secure messaging in the "top 4" box.


1. **The VA.gov home page is long, and a majority of participants (both mobile and desktop) stayed focused on only one part of it (usually the "top 4" boxes), mostly not looking at anything else on the page.** This was true for both mobile and desktop users. One participant on a smartphone stayed focused on the VA Benefits and Health Care dropdown. SHOW VISUALIZATION PICS, INCL. HOW CONSISTENT W/ANALYTICS DATA
    1. Most participants (77%) didn't find the *Resources and support* page on their own, though about half managed to find the travel reimbursement direct deposit article via browsing or searching from the VA.gov home page. The participants who were shown this page wanted easier access to it from the top of the home page near the *Sign in* button or under Menu (for mobile).
    1. Most participants (69%) didn't find the *Find a VA form* page on their own, but once they were shown it, they wanted easier access to it from the top of the home page to the right of Find a VA Location or under Menu (for mobile). 
    1. Half of the participants never opened the *VA Benefits and Health Care* dropdown. *"Oh wow, I didn't even know they had this!" (p17).*
    1. A third of the participants never scrolled down past the row of images on the home page; they stopped as if it were the bottom of the page. TBD: COMPARE THIS WITH ANALYTICS DATA. ==> *Consider moving the row of images down to the actual bottom of the page.*

1. No participants started with site search (in the header of the home page), but about half went there when they were unable to find any relevant links elsewhere on the home page. Some participants said that they didn't notice *Search* in the header at first, but once they found it, a few used it in later tasks.
    1. "It is an option of last resort. When all else fails, use the search function." (p16)
    1. One participant never used site search because they didn't notice it in the header. They readily used the search box, which is visible without clicking, in *Find a Form* and *Resources and Support*. --> *Consider adding a search box next to the word* Search *in the header to make it more visible.*

1. One older participant (81 years old) had difficulty reading the font of the links in the "top 4" boxes.
2. One participant (and also a pilot participant who was a Veteran) wanted to sign in first when they opened VA.gov ("easier to sign in [first] because it will ask me to later", p11). This participant was asked to proceed without signing in. (Does signing in affect navigation in any way, other than changing the link on the right in the header?) 

### Mobile vs. desktop differences


### Other Usability Successes

1. All of the 5 participants who were shown the *Resources and support* page were able to use it to complete the relevant task. 
1. Two participants noticed typeahead prompts while searching and used them. One typed "loans" and then selected "loan eligibility"; the other typed "add spouse" and then selected "dependent".
1. The VA.gov home page worked well with a screen reader. *"This is user friendly for a screen reader...not a lot of graphics...works pretty good" (p19).*


### Other Usability Issues

1. Four participants had a lot of **difficulty searching on the *Find a VA form* page** because they included too many words in the search query and/or misspelled a key word in the query ("representative"). In all of these cases, participants seemed surprised that the didn't get any relevant search results, perhaps because they're accustomed to Google's success with long wordy and misspelled queries.
    1. Search queries that didn't work: "assign a representive", "assign a representative", "va representative for appeals", "how do I get a representative for va assistance", "representative for claim", "representative for claim filing", "representative for claim appeal"
    2. Search queries that *did* work: “assign representative”, "disability representative", "representative appeal"
    3. One participant corrected their spelling of "reimbursement" when they saw a red underline (from the browser), clicked on it, and then chose the correct spelling.
    4. One participant searched for "spouse" but didn't see the add dependent form in the search results.
    5. One participant didn't try the search box at first because they didn't have the form number and didn't realize that you could enter keywords instead.
3. Three participants complained about the COVID banner alert they kept seeing.


## Additional Insights
1. Over half of participants said that **if they can't find what they're looking for, they would call the VA**. However, they try to avoid this because of long hold times, people unable to answer their questions, and frequent transfers to other people/departments. SUMMARIZE WHO THEY SAY THEY'D CALL AT THE VA, AND WHAT ELSE THEY'D DO (GOOGLE).
2. One participant who lives in a rural/remote area and doesn't have cell coverage in his house said that every time he wants to log in, he has to stand outside for 5-12 minutes waiting to receive an authentication text message. He said that his banks and credit card companies all allow authentication via email and asked why the VA isn't doing that. We advised him to download the ID.me authenticator app for **two-factor authentication**. ==> Consider adding an article to Resources and Support about 2FA. Is it possible to use to select a photo like eBenefits does?


## Recommendations
Below are some initial recommendations based on research findings to be discussed and revised with the team: 
1. Because many people aren't finding the Find a Form page and the Resources & Support page links in the footer, consider providing additional links in the header where more people will see it (i.e., "VA Forms", "Resources" or "Help").  
1. Since people spend so much time looking at links in the "top 4" boxes, consider adding additional links and/or a "View more" link in each. Additional links to consider are the following:
    1. Travel pay reimbursement (add to health care box)
    2. Update direct deposit (add to records box?)
    3. Medical records (add to the health care box, in addition to Records)
    4. Update dependents (add to records box and also on the Family Member Benefits page)
    5. Appoint representative (add to disability box)
    6. VA forms (add to disability box)
3. Consider adding a search box next to the word *Search* in the header to make it more visible. Also, the search box that opens when you click should be wider so that long search strings don't scroll off the end.
4. Consider moving the row of images down to the actual bottom of the page so it doesn't give a false "bottom of the page" signal in the middle.
5. Proof of income in the form of benefit letters should be possible to get to from the View payment history page, as well as from site searches for "income" or "proof of income". 
6. Work on improving the Find a Form search. Marci is working with Lighthouse to improve the search logic. Kelson has had success improving the search logic of Resources and support. Consider some of the following:
    1. Strip out articles (e.g., "a") from search queries
    2. Search only on the first few words of a long search query
    3. Add typeahead suggestions when entering a search query 
    4. Add some fixed links per search query (e.g., a search for "spouse" should return the form to add/update dependents)
