This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Participants
We talked to **13 Veterans**, including one who was also a caregiver for another Veteran. One of the sessions was cut short due to technology issues, so most of the findings come from only 12 of the sessions.

## Usability Successes
- All participants were able to successfully complete 3 of the 9 tasks, and most completed 2 more of the tasks.
- Most participants used the links in the "top 4" boxes extensively.
- All of the 5 participants who were shown the *Resources and support* page were able to use it to complete the relevant task.
- 2 participants noticed typeahead prompts while searching and used them.
- Half of the participants used the links in the left nav on content pages.
- The VA.gov home page worked well with a screen reader.

## Usability Issues
- Some participants were unable to successfully complete 4 of the tasks, 2 of which were completed by very few participants (*get form to appoint a representative to help with your claim*, and *get document to show your income from the VA*). 
- The VA.gov home page is long, and many people stay focused on only one part of it (usually the "top 4" boxes), mostly not looking at anything else on the page. 
- No participants started with site search (in the header of the home page), but some went there when they were unable to find any relevant links elsewhere on the home page. Some participants said that they didn't notice *Search* at first, but once they found it, a few used it in later tasks.
- Most participants didn't find the *Resources and support* page on their own, though about half found the travel reimbursement direct deposit article anyway.
- Most participants didn't find the *Find a VA form* page on their own, but once they saw it, they wanted easier access to it from the top of the home page.
- Calling the VA is what many participants say they do if they can't find what they're looking for, but many try to avoid this because of long hold times, people unable to answer their questions, and frequent transfers to other people/departments.
- Half of the participants never opened the *VA Benefits and Health Care* dropdown.
- Half of the participants never scrolled down past the row of images on the home page.
- 4 participants had a lot of difficulty searching on the *Find a VA form* page because they included too many words in the search query and/or misspelled a key word in the query ("representative").
- 3 participants complained about the COVID banner alert they kept seeing.
- 1 older participant (81 years old) had difficulty reading the font of the links in the "top 4" boxes.
