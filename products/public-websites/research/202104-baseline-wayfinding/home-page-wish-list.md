# VA.gov Home Page Wish List (from User Research Recommendations)

### Cindy Merrill, VSA Public Websites team, Oct 22, 2021

This is a quick wish list for the VA.gov home page.

1. Veteran task oriented links to content (as in the current "top 4" boxes)
    1. New links for difficult tasks (e.g., Appoint representative, Travel pay reimbursement, Update direct deposit, Update dependents)
    2. Remove low-use links (per analytics)  
3. Visually prominent link to more task-oriented links
4. Visually prominent links to content by topic (e.g., Education, Disability, Health care, Records, Profile, Family members)
5. Visually prominent Search box (full width so can see your entire search query) 
6. Search box coded as a landmark role to make it easier to find while using a screen reader
7. Search box searches ALL content on VA.gov (including VA forms and Resources & Support) with **most relevant results at the top**
8. Row of photos is at the actual bottom of the page, where it's OK for Veterans stop scrolling
9. Footer is designed with specific uses in mind (e.g., Contact us, Careers, etc.), rather than a catch-all for links that should go on the main part of the page but haven't been incorporated into the design yet (e.g., VA forms, Resources and support, VA outreach events, language assistance).
10. Any banners at the top of the page take up minimal real estate so can always see what's below on the page without scrolling, even on mobile
11. Any banners at the top of the page are relevant (not: "Natural disaster affecting your area" for everyone)
12. Increase font size of links to 19px (current best practice for older users)
