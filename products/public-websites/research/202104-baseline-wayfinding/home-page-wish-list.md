# VA.gov Home Page Wish List (from User Research Recommendations)

### Cindy Merrill, VSA Public Websites team, Oct 25, 2021

This is a quick wish list for the VA.gov home page derived from recent user research findings.

## Support Browsing
Wish List Item | Usability Justification
---------------|----------
Content customized for me | Some links are always irrelevant for some Veterans (e.g., if I have VA health care, never need to see the "Apply for VA health care" link)
Veteran-focused task-oriented links to content | Most Veterans look first at the links in the current "top 4" boxes), but some common tasks aren't there (e.g., Appoint representative, Travel pay reimbursement, Update direct deposit, Update dependents). Some tasks have low use per analytics and could maybe be removed.
Visually prominent link to *more* task-oriented links | Users get stuck when their current task isn't listed 
Visually prominent links to content by topic (e.g., Education, Disability, Health care, Records, Profile, Family members) | Users want to browse by topic and many don't notice the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu or scroll down far enough to see the topics below the row of pictures
 
## Support Searching
Wish List Item | Usability Justification
---------------|----------
Visually prominent Search box, preferably full width so can see entire search query | Users usually don't notice Search in the header
Search box searches ALL content on VA.gov (including VA forms and Resources & Support) with **most relevant results at the top** | Veterans often don't find what they're looking for in the top page of search results 
Search box coded as a landmark role to make it easier to find while using a screen reader | Search input field is hard to notice while using a screen reader


## Intuitive Layout and Usability
Wish List Item | Usability Justification
---------------|----------
Most important content/links are near the top of the page | Many users don't scroll down much or at all on the home page
Row of photos is at the actual bottom of the page, where you stop scrolling | Many users stop scrolling at the photos because they're perceived as the bottom of the page
Footer is designed with specific uses in mind (e.g., Contact us, Careers, etc.) | Because many users never see the footer, they miss some useful links placed there perhaps because they haven't been incorporated into the main part of the page design yet (e.g., VA forms, Resources and support, VA outreach events, language assistance).
Any banners at the top of the page take up minimal real estate so can always see what's below on the page without scrolling, even on mobile | Current banners take up the entire mobile screen and at least half of desktop screens
Any banners at the top of the page are relevant to many Veterans| Current "Natural disaster affecting your area" that everyone sees doesn't apply to anyone most of the time)
Increase font size of links to 19px | This is the current best practice for accommodating older users, of which we have many (including the research participant who couldn't read our 16px links)
