# VA.gov Home Page Wish List (from User Research Recommendations)

### Cindy Merrill, VSA Public Websites team, Oct 25, 2021

This is a quick wish list for the VA.gov home page derived from recent user research findings.  

## Support Browsing
Wish List Item | Usability Justification
---------------|----------
Content customized for me | Some links are always irrelevant for some Veterans (e.g., someone who has VA health care never needs to see the "Apply for VA health care" link)
Veteran-focused task-oriented links to content | Most Veterans look first at the links in the current "top 4" boxes, but some common tasks aren't there (e.g., Appoint representative, Travel pay reimbursement, Update direct deposit, Update dependents). Some tasks have low usage per analytics and could maybe be removed.
Visually prominent link to *more* task-oriented links | Many Veterans get stuck when their current task isn't listed in the "top 4" boxes
Visually prominent links to content by topic (e.g., Education, Disability, Health care, Records, Profile, Family members) | Many Veterans want to browse by topic and many don't notice the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu or scroll down far enough to see the topics below the row of pictures
 
## Support Searching
Wish List Item | Usability Justification
---------------|----------
Visually prominent Search box, preferably full device width | Many Veterans don't notice Search in the header, at least at first. Some who do enter queries that are longer than can be viewed in their entirety in the currently short query field
Search box searches ALL content on VA.gov (including VA forms and Resources & Support) with **most relevant results at the top** | Veterans often don't find what they're looking for in the top page of VA.gov search results and don't bother looking at other pages of results
Search box coded as a landmark role | Search input field is hard to find while using a screen reader because you have to look for a form


## Intuitive Layout and Usability
Wish List Item | Usability Justification
---------------|----------
Most important content/links are near the top of the page | Many Veterans don't scroll down much or at all on the home page
Row of photos is at the actual bottom of the page, where you stop scrolling | Many Veterans stop scrolling at the photos because they're perceived as the bottom of the page
Footer is designed with specific uses in mind (e.g., Contact us, Careers, etc.) | Because many Veterans never scroll down to see the footer, they miss  useful links placed there perhaps because they haven't been incorporated into the main page design (e.g., VA forms, Resources and support, VA outreach events, language assistance).
Any banners at the top of the page take up minimal real estate so can always see what's below on the page without scrolling, even on mobile | Current banners usually take up the entire mobile screen and at least half of desktop screens (until they're dismissed by the user)
Any banners at the top of the page are relevant to most Veterans | Current "Natural disaster affecting your area" that everyone sees doesn't apply to anyone most of the time)
Increase font size of links to 19px | 19px is the current best practice to accommodate older users, of which we have many (including one Veteran research participant who couldn't read our 16px links)
