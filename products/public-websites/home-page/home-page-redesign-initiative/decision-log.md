Documenting rationale for decisions made during the course of this initiative

Date | Decision | Rationale
--- | --- | --- |
| June 2022 | Determination of which top tasks to include in [moderated/unmoderated research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research) | Intentionally tried to keep list as succinct as possible to minimize cognitive load and participant willingness during survey - decisions on individual tasks can be found in [Veterans Top Task sheet in Drive](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rhaV0rZJcVYfwMaHWUpxHyC0cMQP_lDd/edit#gid=1357444844) | 
| June 2022| Cohort definitions for [Top Task research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated/research-plan.md) | Include Veterans, service members and a range of types of beneficiaries who have various benefit experiences, including those with no health care experience, to avoid bias toward healthcare related tasks 
| June 2022 | Removal of "Survivor" as targeted participant in cohorts for [Top Task Unmoderated research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/research-plan.md) | "Survivor" is no longer a defined type of participant on recruiting questionaire
| June 2022 | Reduction in target number for participants without any VA benefit experience for [Redesigned homepage Usability](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/redesigned-homepage-usability/research-plan.md) | This type of participant is inherently difficult to recruit because they aren't involved with VA.
