## Relevant research
[**Comprehensive user research conducted for the 2018 VA.gov home page**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-gov-relaunch-2018/user-research/brand-consolidation-research-summary-10-25-2018.pptx) | October 2018

- **Goals**
  - To learn how to organize other “non-benefit” resources 
  - To validate benefit lifecycle assumptions
  - To gather feedback on homepage designs
  - To validate the navigation model. 

- **Relevant findings from that series of studies include**
  - The default mental model used by Veterans is organization by benefit category, followed by task.  
  - Veterans prefer simple, clear, easy to read layouts and are overwhelmed by too many options.
  - Veterans want above the fold, one-click access for priority tasks.
  - “Explore and apply” label works well for many tasks but differentiating between “get” and “manage” adds complexity.
  - Sheer volume of content and menu levels contributes to poor performance on navigation tasks. 

[**Logged-in homepage user research findings**](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md) | May 2020

- **Goal:** To talk with Veterans to better understand their needs and what would make the logged-in experience more useful to them inform the design for treating the logged-in homepage as a user's personalized landing pad and router

- **Relevant findings include**
  - Participants want a page that is focused on current information specific to them, rather than generalized information for all Veterans.
  - Participants are primarily interested in completing healthcare and disability related tasks such as messaging, ordering medication, and checking claim status.
  - Participants were interested in benefit recommendations and eligibility information.
  - Participants were interested in information that helps them be more involved with the VA as a whole, and take better care of themselves.
  - Participants expect a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks on their homepage, and want clear labels to understand next steps.
  - Participants typically look for notifications in the top portion of a page, but expect notifications from the VA outside of their logged-in experience.

- **Goal:** To determine how well the VA.gov homepage enables Veteran task completion

- **Relevant findings include**
  - This research demonstrated consistency of Veteran wayfinding regardless of their familiarity with the site, presence of cognitive issues or device used. 
  - Most participants focused on the top four boxes and tasks easily identified there had the highest rates of success.
  - It is difficult to find tasks which don't appear in the top 4 boxes. For example, only 8% of participants were able to find a form to appoint a representative.
  - Search was used as a last resort, if at all.
  - Only half opened the mega menu, one-third never scrolled beyond the images and most didn’t find “Find a VA” or “Resources and support”.
