## Product context
Conceived as the unifying "Veteran-facing digital brand" for the Department of Veteran Affairs when it launched in late 2018, VA.gov has become the front-door to top tasks, tools and information for Veterans and their beneficiaries. 

In the nearly three years since the site's launch, the range of VA benefits and programs has grown and evolved, with new valuable offerings. The VA.gov authenticated experience has expanded to include MyVA, MyProfile, eBenefits migration, and soon MyHealthevet integration. 

The VA.gov homepage needs to effectively bridge users to the personalized logged-in experience and act as a vital guidepost to a growing selection of new information and benefit services while managing stakeholders competing for valuable real estate on the homepage. 

| Intention | Experience | User story |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Learn | Unauth | I need to discover/learn information about the benefits and services available to me because I am new to the VA or I have a new need/life circumstance.
| Apply |  Auth | I need to create an account so I can take advantage of the personalized, streamlined experience. 
| Manage | Auth | I need to manage my benefits and services, such as edit my existing profile or take an action, such as making an appointment.
