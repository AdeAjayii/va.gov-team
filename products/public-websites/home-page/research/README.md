| Research title	|	Date	|	Research objectives	|	Link to findings	| Key findings
|	-----	|	-----	|	-----	|	-----	|-----	|
| Top Tasks - Unmoderated | _Planned for June 2022_ | To discover which tasks are viewed as most important by Veterans, caregivers, family members, survivors and service members |[Unmoderated research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks)| _TBD_| 
| Top Tasks - Moderated | _Kicking off May 2022_ | To validate the task list and questions to be used in unmoderated research | [Moderated research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated) | _TBD_|
| Baseline Wayfinding Research on VA.gov | April 2021 | To determine how well the VA.gov homepage enables Veteran task completion |[Wayfinding research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding#baseline-wayfinding-research-on-vagov-april-2021) | <ul><li>This research demonstrated consistency of Veteran wayfinding regardless of their familiarity with the site, presence of cognitive issues or device used.</li><li>Most participants focused on the top four boxes and tasks easily identified there had the highest rates of success.</li><li>It is difficult to find tasks which don't appear in the top 4 boxes. For example, only 8% of participants were able to find a form to appoint a representative</li><li>Search was used as a last resort, if at all.</li><li>Only half opened the mega menu, one-third never scrolled beyond the images and most didn’t find “Find a VA” or “Resources and support”.</li><li>See also this homepage user wish list</li></ui>
| Comprehensive user research conducted for the 2018 VA.gov home page | October 2018 | <ul><li> To learn how to organize other “non-benefit” resources </li><li> To validate benefit lifecycle assumptions </li><li> To gather feedback on homepage designs</li><li> To validate the navigation model.</li></ul>| [Comprehensive user findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-gov-relaunch-2018/user-research/brand-consolidation-research-summary-10-25-2018.pptx) | <ul><li>The default mental model used by Veterans is organization by benefit category, followed by task.</li><li>Veterans prefer simple, clear, easy to read layouts and are overwhelmed by too many options.</li><li>Veterans want above the fold, one-click access for priority tasks.</li><li>“Explore and apply” label works well for many tasks but differentiating between “get” and “manage” adds complexity.</li><li>Sheer volume of content and menu levels contributes to poor performance on navigation tasks.</li></ui>

| Comparative analysis: Personalization and profile| December 2021 | To compare aspects of personalized and authenticated civic service experiences with those in the private sector | [Personalization and profile findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/discovery-research/comparative-analysis/personalization-profile-comparative-analytsis.pptx) | The key differences between the authenticated experience (AE) on VA.gov and comparative sites are the <ul><li>logged in homepage</li><li>information architecture</li></ul> 
| Health apartment homepage - Guerilla testing of homepage concepts | December 2021 | To learn how Veterans manage their health care, what actions Veterans expect to take and what information is expected in each section | [Apartment homepage findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/design/design%20presentation/Design%20and%20Research%20Share%2012.20.21%20-%20Guerilla%20Research.pdf)|<ul><li>Participants wanted specific task-specific action links</li><li>Tasks should be clear and separate from information links</li><li>Participants wanted some form of personalization (especially for health care and disability tasks)</li></ui>
| Search Design Concepts Usability Research | September 2021 | To get user feedback on new design concepts for surfacing site search and other search tools, including [a new link on the VA.gov home page under the "top 4" boxes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/images/new-search-link.png) that goes to the new search landing page and [links to other search tools](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/images/search-landing-pg.png) | [Search design findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/research-findings.md) | <ul><li>Participants were laser focused on finding a search box to use. Once they found it, most participants didn't scroll down below it</li><li>Consolidation of all the search tools is recommended since using different search tools on different pages can be confusing (i.e., VA.gov site search, Find a VA Form, Resources and Support)</li><li>Search on VA.gov returns a lot of irrelevant results, and so many Veterans have learned to look elsewhere first.</li></ui>
| Logged-in Homepage User Research | May 2020 | To talk with Veterans to better understand their needs and what would make the logged-in experience more useful to them inform the design for treating the logged-in homepage as a user's personalized landing pad and router | [Logged in findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md) | <ul><li>Participants want a page that is focused on current information specific to them, rather than generalized information for all Veterans.</li><li>Participants are primarily interested in completing healthcare and disability related tasks such as messaging, ordering medication, and checking claim status.</li><li>Participants were interested in benefit recommendations and eligibility information.</li><li>Participants were interested in information that helps them be more involved with the VA as a whole, and take better care of themselves.</li><li>Participants expect a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks on their homepage, and want clear labels to understand next steps.</li><li>Participants typically look for notifications in the top portion of a page, but expect notifications from the VA outside of their logged-in experience.</li></ui>
