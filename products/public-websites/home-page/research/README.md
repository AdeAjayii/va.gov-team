## Homepage research

### [Veteran Top Tasks UNMODERATED](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks) | _In planning 2Q22_
- Goal: To determine how well the VA.gov homepage enables Veteran task completion

### [Baseline Wayfinding Research on VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding#baseline-wayfinding-research-on-vagov-april-2021) | April 2021
- Goal: To determine how well the VA.gov homepage enables Veteran task completion
- Relevant findings include
  - This research demonstrated consistency of Veteran wayfinding regardless of their familiarity with the site, presence of cognitive issues or device used. 
  - Most participants focused on the top four boxes and tasks easily identified there had the highest rates of success.
  - It is difficult to find tasks which don't appear in the top 4 boxes. For example, only 8% of participants were able to find a form to appoint a representative.
  - Search was used as a last resort, if at all.
  - Only half opened the mega menu, one-third never scrolled beyond the images and most didn’t find “Find a VA” or “Resources and support”.

### [Comprehensive user research conducted for the 2018 VA.gov home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-gov-relaunch-2018/user-research/brand-consolidation-research-summary-10-25-2018.pptx) | October 2018
- Goals
  - To learn how to organize other “non-benefit” resources 
  - To validate benefit lifecycle assumptions
  - To gather feedback on homepage designs
  - To validate the navigation model. 
- Relevant findings from that series of studies include
  - The default mental model used by Veterans is organization by benefit category, followed by task.  
  - Veterans prefer simple, clear, easy to read layouts and are overwhelmed by too many options.
  - Veterans want above the fold, one-click access for priority tasks.
  - “Explore and apply” label works well for many tasks but differentiating between “get” and “manage” adds complexity.
  - Sheer volume of content and menu levels contributes to poor performance on navigation tasks.

### [Comparative analysis: Personalization and profile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/discovery-research/comparative-analysis/personalization-profile-comparative-analytsis.pptx) | December 2021
- Goal: To compare aspects of personalized and authenticated civic service experiences with those in the private sector 
- Relevant findings include
  - Key differences between the authenticated experience (AE) on VA.gov and comparative site 
    - the logged in homepage. 
    - information architecture

### [Health apartment homepage - Guerilla testing of homepage concepts](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/design/design%20presentation/Design%20and%20Research%20Share%2012.20.21%20-%20Guerilla%20Research.pdf) | December 2021
- Goal: To learn how Veterans manage their health care, what actions Veterans expect to take and what information is expected in each section
- Relevant findings include
  - Participants wanted specific task-specific action links
  - Tasks should be clear and separate from information links
  - Participants wanted some form of personalization (especially for health care and disability tasks)

### [Logged-in Homepage User Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md) | May 2020
- Goal: To talk with Veterans to better understand their needs and what would make the logged-in experience more useful to them inform the design for treating the logged-in homepage as a user's personalized landing pad and router
- Relevant findings include
  - Participants want a page that is focused on current information specific to them, rather than generalized information for all Veterans.
  - Participants are primarily interested in completing healthcare and disability related tasks such as messaging, ordering medication, and checking claim status.
  - Participants were interested in benefit recommendations and eligibility information.
  - Participants were interested in information that helps them be more involved with the VA as a whole, and take better care of themselves.
  - Participants expect a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks on their homepage, and want clear labels to understand next steps.
  - Participants typically look for notifications in the top portion of a page, but expect notifications from the VA outside of their logged-in experience.
