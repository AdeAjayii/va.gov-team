| VA.gov Home Page Redesign Usability Testing | _Planned for July 2022_ | To get user feedback on the redesigned VA.gov home page and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page |[Usability research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-plan.md)|  _TBD_|
| Top Tasks - Unmoderated | June 2022 | To discover which tasks are viewed as most important by Veterans, caregivers, family members, and service members |[Unmoderated top task findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/research-findings.md)| <ul><li> Most top tasks were related to health care.</li><li>Most frequently done tasks were all related to health care and aligned closely with the overall top tasks. </li><li>Top tasks vary by participant age and are quite different for participants who don't use VA health care. </li><li>Participants selected an average of 9.5 tasks as important.</li><li> It is challenging to recruit people who don't use VA benefits. </li></ui> |
| Top Tasks - Moderated | May 2022 | To validate the task list and questions to be used in unmoderated research | [Moderated research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated/research-findings.md) | <ul><li>The survey was well-received by research participants overall. Small adjustments will be made before launching the unmoderated phase, such as changes to task wording, support for participants interacting with the VA indirectly and expansion of the instructions and context for the survey. </li><li>Participants selected an average of 13 tasks as important (ranging from 3 to 26). </li></ui>|
| Baseline Wayfinding Research on VA.gov | April 2021 | To determine how well the VA.gov homepage enables Veteran task completion |[Wayfinding research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding#baseline-wayfinding-research-on-vagov-april-2021) | <ul><li>This research demonstrated consistency of Veteran wayfinding regardless of their familiarity with the site, presence of cognitive issues or device used.</li><li>Most participants focused on the top four boxes and tasks easily identified there had the highest rates of success.</li><li>It is difficult to find tasks which don't appear in the top 4 boxes. For example, only 8% of participants were able to find a form to appoint a representative</li><li>Search was used as a last resort, if at all.</li><li>Only half opened the mega menu, one-third never scrolled beyond the images and most didn’t find “Find a VA” or “Resources and support”.</li><li>See also this homepage user wish list</li></ui>
| Comprehensive user research conducted for the 2018 VA.gov home page | October 2018 | <ul><li> To learn how to organize other “non-benefit” resources </li><li> To validate benefit lifecycle assumptions </li><li> To gather feedback on homepage designs</li><li> To validate the navigation model.</li></ul>| [Comprehensive user findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-gov-relaunch-2018/user-research/brand-consolidation-research-summary-10-25-2018.pptx) | <ul><li>The default mental model used by Veterans is organization by benefit category, followed by task.</li><li>Veterans prefer simple, clear, easy to read layouts and are overwhelmed by too many options.</li><li>Veterans want above the fold, one-click access for priority tasks.</li><li>“Explore and apply” label works well for many tasks but differentiating between “get” and “manage” adds complexity.</li><li>Sheer volume of content and menu levels contributes to poor performance on navigation tasks.</li></ui>

| My VA Redirect UAT | August 2022 | To confirm that the redirect to My VA from homepage log-in functions as expected and to evaluate how the redirect does or doesn’t meet Veteran expectations. | [Redirect UAT research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/my-va-redirect/UAT/research-plan.md)
| Health Hub Moderated Tree Test | July 2022 | To understand how Veterans navigate between "get benefits" and "manage benefits" for healthcare | [Link to plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/Health%20Hub/Research/Research%20%232/Draft%20Research%20plan%202%207.12.22.pdf) | |
| Health Hub benefits navigation - IA Tree Jack | May 2022 | To evaluate which design better helps Veterans navigate tasks in ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’, specifically for health care: when there is one unified section to ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’ (H0) or when there are two separate sections for ‘get benefits’ and ‘manage benefits’ (H1) | [Final IA treejack synthesis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/Health%20Hub/Research/IA%20Tree%20Test%201/Reasearch%20synthesis%20Veteran%20and%20caregiver%20IA%20treejack%207.12.22.pdf) |<ul><li> H0 performed best on "manage tasks" and had the most direct success, including for Veterans without health care </li><li> There wasn't a clear hypothesis that outperformed the other for "get" tasks | 
| Comparative analysis: Personalization and profile| December 2021 | To compare aspects of personalized and authenticated civic service experiences with those in the private sector | [Personalization and profile findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/discovery-research/comparative-analysis/personalization-profile-comparative-analytsis.pptx) | The key differences between the authenticated experience (AE) on VA.gov and comparative sites are the <ul><li>logged in homepage</li><li>information architecture</li></ul> 
| Health apartment homepage - Guerilla testing of homepage concepts | December 2021 | To learn how Veterans manage their health care, what actions Veterans expect to take and what information is expected in each section | [Apartment homepage findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/design/design%20presentation/Design%20and%20Research%20Share%2012.20.21%20-%20Guerilla%20Research.pdf)|<ul><li>Participants wanted specific task-specific action links</li><li>Tasks should be clear and separate from information links</li><li>Participants wanted some form of personalization (especially for health care and disability tasks)</li></ui>
| Search Design Concepts Usability Research | September 2021 | To get user feedback on new design concepts for surfacing site search and other search tools, including [a new link on the VA.gov home page under the "top 4" boxes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/images/new-search-link.png) that goes to the new search landing page and [links to other search tools](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/images/search-landing-pg.png) | [Search design findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/research-findings.md) | <ul><li>Participants were laser focused on finding a search box to use. Once they found it, most participants didn't scroll down below it</li><li>Consolidation of all the search tools is recommended since using different search tools on different pages can be confusing (i.e., VA.gov site search, Find a VA Form, Resources and Support)</li><li>Search on VA.gov returns a lot of irrelevant results, and so many Veterans have learned to look elsewhere first.</li></ui>
| Logged-in Homepage User Research | May 2020 | To talk with Veterans to better understand their needs and what would make the logged-in experience more useful to them inform the design for treating the logged-in homepage as a user's personalized landing pad and router | [Logged in findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md) | <ul><li>Participants want a page that is focused on current information specific to them, rather than generalized information for all Veterans.</li><li>Participants are primarily interested in completing healthcare and disability related tasks such as messaging, ordering medication, and checking claim status.</li><li>Participants were interested in benefit recommendations and eligibility information.</li><li>Participants were interested in information that helps them be more involved with the VA as a whole, and take better care of themselves.</li><li>Participants expect a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks on their homepage, and want clear labels to understand next steps.</li><li>Participants typically look for notifications in the top portion of a page, but expect notifications from the VA outside of their logged-in experience.</li></ui>
