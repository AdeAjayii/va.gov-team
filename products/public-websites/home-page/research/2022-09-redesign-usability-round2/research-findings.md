# Research Goals
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the *newly revised* version of the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page were used and how well it supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

Use of the VA.gov home page fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 

- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions
*Note: In this research plan, "successfully completing" a task means that a participant has navigated to a web page on VA.gov where they could do that task or sign in to do the task (participants did NOT sign in during the sessions).*
1. Are participants able to successfully complete tasks from the home page without getting stuck?
    1. For tasks previously assessed, how do task success rates compare to those in the first round of usability testing?
    2. For tasks previously assessed, how do task success rates compare to those in the baseline wayfinding study last year?
1. Which parts of the home page do participants use to complete tasks? 
    1. Benefit promo at top of page (PACT Act article)
    2. "Create account" button
    4. The new search box 
    5. "Other search tools" 
    3. "Popular on VA.gov"
    4. VA News promo (Pathfinder article)
    6. Benefit hubs 
    9. Header (including Search, Sign in, VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu)
    10. Footer 
1. Do participants know when to use the "Sign in" *vs.* "Create account" buttons?
1. Is there anything that participants find unclear or confusing on the home page, especially when using a smartphone or a screen reader? 
1. What are participants' impressions of the two new promo sections (with PACT Act and Pathfinder news articles)?
    1. How would they get more details on these topics?
    1. How would they get stories on other topics? 

## Areas of focus
In this research, we were primarily interested in the following areas of the home page as used in task completion:
- Benefit promo (PACT Act article)
- "Create account" button
- The new search box
- "Other search tools"
- "Popular on VA.gov"
- VA News promo (Pathfinder article)
- Benefit hubs

# Methodology 
We conducted **remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom**. Participants were asked a few questions about their experiences with VA benefits, and then were given tasks as wayfinding prompts to explore the redesigned VA.gov home page on the Staging server. Some of the top tasks were listed in the "Popular on VA.gov" section of the redesigned home page, while others were not. Below is the complete list of 8 tasks:
1. Message your doctor
1. Show you're a Veteran (benefit letter or Veteran ID card)
1. Find mental health counselor/therapist
1. Find recent changes in benefits/services (VA benefit promo)
1. Learn what else is new from the VA (news stories)
1. Add spouse (Review/update dependents)
1. Check current disability compensation rates
1. Compare education benefits by school
1. File for disability increase

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. The revised home page design will result in improved task success rates as compared to the previous round of usability testing, especially the 4 tasks that had the lowest success rates in the previous round. 
     1. MOSTLY TRUE: Success rates for all tasks improved, though some not by much, except for "Message your doctor", which was worse.
     2. *Find mental health counselor/therapist* (100% this round *vs.* 90% previous round)
     3. *File for disability increase* (100% this round *vs.* 50% previous round)
     4. *Check current disability compensation rates* (88% this round *vs.* 60% previous round)
     7. *Compare education benefits by school* (63% this round *vs.* 56% previous round)
     6. *Add spouse (Review/update dependents)* (60% this round *vs.* 56% previous round)
     5. ***Message your doctor* (55% this round *vs.* 83% previous round)**
   
     6. *File for disability increase* (100% this round *vs.* 50% previous round)
1. There are no significant differences in task success rate across devices (especially smartphones) or screen reader users.
     1. TRUE: Participant success rates were not correlated by participant device or assistive technology use (screen magnifiers). 
3. Participants will know when to use the "sign in" *vs.* "create an account" buttons.
     1. UNKNOWN: All participants in this study already had accounts on VA.gov that they could use to sign in, and many of them knew to use the "sign in" button. We still need to see what participants without accounts would do.
4. The home page supports multiple ways of navigating, and participants will find a way to complete every task--i.e., there's a navigation path that works for them. 
     1. FALSE: 10 of 11 participants got stuck on at least one task, even though the home page supports multiple navigation paths. 
5. Participants understand that the top promo is about benefits or services for Veterans.
     1. FALSE: Only 3 of 11 participants went there when asked about benefit changes, and everyone else scrolled down past it.
7. Participants understand that the bottom promo is news and know how to get more news stories.
     1. FALSE: Only 4 of 11 participants went there to click on "More VA news" when asked about VA stories, and everyone else looked elsewhere. The featured Pathfinder article didn't look like news, and the "More VA news" link was small and overlooked.

# Key Findings
1. **A few participants focused their attention on a specific part of the home page, while others scrolled up and down the home page more fluidly**. 
1. **Many participants got stuck on some of the tasks, and when that happened, most *didn't* try to use search.**
2. Compared to the previous round of usability testing, **5 tasks performed better and 1 fared worse in successful completions**.
3. **Some participants didn't click on either of the promos**. 
4. There may be an **accessibility issue for screen magnifier users with buttons on the far right side of web pages**.


# Details of Findings
## In-scope findings for home page redesign

### 1. A few participants focused their attention on a specific part of the home page, while others scrolled up and down the home page more fluidly.

As in the previous round of usability testing, some participants tended to **focus their attention on a specific part of the home page**--often either the header (2 on phones and 1 on desktop) OR the *Popular at VA.gov*, Search, and *Other search tools* (2 on phones). Others scrolled up and down the home page more fluidly while working on tasks. 
- **Most participants (8 of 11) used the links in *Popular on VA.gov*.** Next most used were the header (7 of 11), benefit hubs (6 of 11), and footer (6 of 11). Fewer people used *Other search tools*, the two promos, and the new search box. No participants used *Create account*, probably because all already had a VA.gov account. Below you can see the different areas of the redesigned home page labeled, followed by the percentages of participants who clicked on each area of the page. 
- There were **3 participants who had less experience using VA.gov than the other 8 people. The parts of the home page used by these two subsets of participants were similar**, with the highest usage being *Popular on VA.gov*, followed by the header, footer, and benefit hubs in slightly different orders. The more experienced participants made more use of *Other search tools* and the two promos.
- Two participants using smartphones didn't scroll past the top of the dark blue VA news promo section. More user research or analytics checking could help see whether this might be a new "false footer" on the home page.
- One participant on a smartphone said they thought ***Popular on VA.gov*** was the bottom of the page because the text **looked so plain and unformatted** and so appeared to be links in the footer. Another participant also commented on how plain the *Popular on VA.gov* links looked, as compared to the benefit hubs, which each have a colored icon. 
- One participant said they liked the colored logos in front of each of the benefit hubs. A different participant said they liked the descriptions of each benefit hub, whereas someone else said that the descriptions sounded too informational and not task-focused (i.e., apply/learn about benefits, not manage benefits), and so didn't click on them.   
- One participant saw very little of the home page at once because of the large font size displayed on their phone. They saw even less of the page because they started off using their phone in landscape mode, but later changed to portrait when the moderator asked about it.
- We can compare the home page click results from this study with the [previous round of usability testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md) and the last year's [Baseline Wayfinding study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md). From the comparison of the data from 3 research studies below, we can see that **people seem to be scrolling farther down the redesigned home page without the presence of the false footer--so making better use of the entire home page. There are also more clicks on the benefit hubs and footer**, perhaps because participants aren't finding what they need farther up (because the "top 4" boxes are missing). We make only these broad conclusions because of the following caveats:
  - The **tasks in these three studies were different**. In this study, there were no tasks specifically geared towards *Other search tools* as in the previous study, but there were new tasks around the VA news and benefit promos.
  - There were **fewer tasks in this study (8)** than in the previous study (20) and the baseline wayfinding study (9), and in the previous study, different people did different subsets of the 20 tasks.
  - There were **fewer participants in this study (11)** than in the previous study (19) and the baseline wayfinding study (13).

![home-pg-clicks-3-studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/2022-09-redesign-usability-round2/images/home-pg-clicks-3-studies.png)
          
### 2. Many participants got stuck on some of the tasks, and when that happened, most *didn't* try to use search.
- **All participants except one got stuck on some task(s)** during the sessions. This includes 5 of the 6 participants who said they'd sign in first, as well as others who didn't sign in first.
- More than half of the participants didn't use search at all; only 5 of 11 participants tried it. The new search box was used by 3 of 11 participants, and 2 other participants used search in the header (where they were used to it being).
- Four of the 5 people used search when they said they were stuck, and 2 of the 5 used it *every time* they were stuck.
- Two people used search when they didn't appear to be stuck.

### 3. Compared to the previous round of usability testing, **5 tasks performed better and 1 fared worse in successful completions**.
- ***Message your doctor* had the lowest task success rate, which was *lower than the previous round of usability testing*** (**55%** this time *vs.* 83% before). 5 of 11 participants used the new *VA health care* link in *Popular*, but others were confused because they're accustomed to doing this task in MyHealtheVet, not VA.gov. One person thought the thought the *VA Health care* link would be about applying and so didn't click on it.
- ***Message your doctor* and *Add spouse* had lower task success rates than the 2021 Baseline Wayfinding** study, which tested the current production version of the home page.
- **Two other tasks also had low success rates**: *Compare education benefits by school* and *Learn what else is new from the VA.*
- **Five tasks *improved* since the previous round of usability testing**, though the amount of gain varied.
- Most participants (9 of 10) were able to successfully complete the *Show you're a Veteran* task, and so **having no task-oriented links for Veteran ID cards and benefit letters seems OK**. 

- Below is the summary of all task success rates and participant ratings of difficulty: ![task-success&ratings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/2022-09-redesign-usability-round2/images/task-success%26ratings.png)
- For some of the problematic tasks, below are the primary reasons why they were difficult and what might help make them easier:

Task | Why Difficult | What Could Potentially Help
------------------|--------------|-----------
Message your doctor | **Couldn't find by browsing** (missed link on health care page), used to doing from MHV and not VA.gov, benefit hub description for "health care" looked like it was for applying/creating account and not for managing health care, 1 person unfamiliar because doesn't use VA health care | A more intuitive way for people to manage VA health care from the VA.gov home page
Add a spouse (review/update dependents) | **Couldn't find by browsing** the disability hub page (3 of 10 tried megamenu or *benefit hubs > Family member benefits*) **or searching** | Add "View or change dependent" to *Family Member Benefits* page, as a search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation" for "spouse" and "dependent"
File for disability increase | **Link goes to application for disability that doesn't mention filing for an increase**, surprised that the link for disability increase was the same as for filing an initial claim: *"Had I known it was the same form, I would have just used the previous link I had clicked on" (p11)* | Make clear on [disability application page](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction) that this form can be used to *increase your existing* disability rating (i.e., add to heading "or increase your current rating")
Check current disability compensation rates | **Couldn't find by browsing** the megamenu or disability hub page (didn't notice link on that long page), **hard to find by searching**| Add "View disability rates" to megamenu under Disability, search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation"  
Find mental health counselor/therapist | Couldn't find how to contact someone quickly by phone or chat from [mental health page linked to in footer](https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/), didn't notice Veterans Crisis Line in top right because it scrolled off the screen, or while looking at left side of home page with a screen magnifier| Change footer link to go to the [modernized mental health page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/health-needs-conditions/mental-health/) that the link in *Popular* goes to, Add "mental health" to megamenu under health care

### 4. Some participants didn't click on either of the promos 
- Many participants (5 of 11) **didn't think that the PACT Act article was about a change in benefits** and scrolled down past it to the footer to press releases, header, or *Find benefit resources and support*. One person didn't know what the PACT Act was (see quote below; we know it doesn't apply to everyone), but we don't know specifics on why the others didn't open the PACT Act article. It may have been because it looks like a banner ad or hero image at the top of the page, and/or because they thought looked like news rather than benefit changes (as stated in the user task).
- Four participants **didn't notice the *More VA News* link**. They were looking in the header, the footer (in *More VA resources > Get VA updates* and *Outreach materials*), and *Find benefit resources and support* in *Other search tools*. One participant said that they expected news to be at the top of the page, but the *More VA news* link they found was a lot farther down the page.
- One participant said that VA News is *"just taking up space and not helping with a task" (p11)*. 
- One participant was looking for an indication that the promo content was new (*vs.* always on the page). Without a date or the word "new!" like p2 saw in Press Releases (found via Footer > VA Updates > Press Releases), p2 assumed that the promo content was something she had already seen.
- None of the 11 participants clicked on the Pathfinder article. One said that they wouldn't read it because it's not relevant to them. Another said that it *"sounds very corporate, talking about soliciting to Veterans, and I don't like it" (p11).*
> *"Don't know what this is [PACT Act]...doesn't apply to me" (p4)*.

### 5. There may be an accessibility issue for screen magnifier users with buttons on the far right side of web pages.
- An accessibility issue was discovered in which **buttons on the far right side of the home page were missed while using a screen magnifier on a computer**. One participant (using ZoomText on a computer) didn't notice the *Veterans Crisis Line* button at the top right of the home page, as well as the *Feedback* button on the bottom right of other VA.gov pages. His magnified view showed only the left half of the page, and without any visual indication of more to the right, he assumed there wasn't anything there. The *Popular on VA.gov* section is also on the right side of the page, and this participant said he knew something was there because the background color was different. **Further research could be conducted with screen magnifier users to learn more about this issue, including whether the *Create account* button is similarly invisible.**

### 6. Other findings on the home page
- Some participants (3 of 11) went to the **search tool *Find benefit resources and support* when they were unsure of where else to look** (e.g., for recent benefit changes, news stories, proof of Veteran status). One participant thought it would have the list of benefits that you could get with a given disability rating.
- **Only one participant mentioned being bothered by the duplicate links in *Popular on VA.gov* and the benefit hubs**. No one else said anything, perhaps because they were unable to able to see *Popular on VA.gov* and the benefit hubs on their screen at the same time.
> *"Mimicking, waste of space, not to the point" (p2)*.

- **No one expressed any interest in the email newsletter**, though this wasn't an area of focus for this research, nor was there a task about it. Two participants shared that they already receive some kind of email newsletters from the VA.
> *"I probably would get spammed with a zillion emails or a newsletter" (p3)*.
> 
> *"I wouldn't come here [to VA.gov] just to look for information on benefits" (p9, who receives emails from the VA "all the time" and visits VA.gov when he wants to check on his benefits, submit a claim, or manage his medical care).*

- One participant who was especially negative about the VA.gov site at the beginning of the research session had changed her mind by the end. She started off by sharing her frustrations with being redirected to VA.gov from eBenefits or MyHealtheVet and struggling to log in, and also complaining about how overwhelming the pages are and slow to load. During the session, she was able to complete ALL of the tasks successfully (the only participant of 11 to do so) and had very positive feedback by the end of the session. 
> *"It's a lot easier than the VA.gov I am used to...It's pretty streamlined and easier to use" [uses VA.gov about 2-3x/month] (p11)".*

- Just over half of the participants (6 of 11) wanted to sign in before doing any tasks. 
> *"You will need to sign in, so why not sign in first. I don’t know how to do it without signing in. This feels backward since you need to sign in anyways" (p1).*

> *"Once you login, everything is easier to find information" (p4, who signs in first every time he goes to VA.gov).*

### 7. Findings around recruiting 
- We tried to test with screen reader users, but it didn't work in this study. We learned that participants recruited as screen reader users don't always use screen readers for ALL of their web browsing, and ***none* of the four people in this study used a screen reader at all during the research session**. The reasons why are listed below:
  - Two participants have some vision and so avoid using screen readers unless they really need them, such as when they have a long article to read. They both used screen magnifiers, and I didn’t ask them to use their screen readers during the session because that’s not how they normally browse web pages. 
  - Another participant joined using a smartphone as she was asked to do by Perigean, but she normally uses a tablet with accessibility features. I asked if she could switch to the tablet, but she couldn’t because she didn’t have the Zoom app installed on it and wasn’t able to do that during the session. She is accustomed to holding her phone screen close to her face to read it, so that’s how she participated in the session. 
  - The fourth participant seems to be able to see but uses a screen reader only when she feels physically or mentally unwell, which was not the case during the session. Plus, she was in a moving car and not using her phone because she couldn’t join with it (for unknown reasons), and so she was using her boyfriend’s phone instead.
- **People recruited to join the research session using a specific device (e.g., smartphone) may or may not be comfortable browsing websites from that device**. One of the participants recruited to use a smartphone during this study said they always use a computer, not a phone, to access VA.gov. Another participant recruited to use a smartphone during the session generally uses a tablet to browse the web, not a phone. 
> *“Most of it is getting used to using a phone instead of a computer when you’re used to using a computer on a regular basis” (p5).* 

- We wanted to test with some people who were unfamiliar with VA.gov. As it turns out, ***everyone* recruited to join the research session already had an account on VA.gov, even if Perigean said that some didn't**. They recruited 4 people who said they didn't have accounts, one was a no-show, and the other 3 told me that they already had accounts. One of those participants was a caregiver who had created an account on VA.gov only a month ago, and the Veteran she cares for doesn't use any VA benefits, so that was only one person who was fairly new to using the website and had no VA benefits experience.

### 8. Ideas from participants
Participants shared some ideas for how they wanted to improve the home page, which are listed below. Each idea is from a single participant, unless noted otherwise.
- Would like to have the benefit hubs higher up on the page so they're easier to find and use (2 participants).
- Would like to have *Popular on VA.gov* higher up on the page so it's easier to find and use (2 participants).
- Would like to have a search bar at the bottom of the page to use if you scroll through the entire page and don't find what you're looking for.
- The header "Explore VA benefits and health care" header above the benefit hubs seemed _"like twiddling your thumbs" (p11)_. Better would be something more task or goal oriented, such as "What do you need?" or "What would you like to do?".
- Would be nice to have an area for community connections--organizations that partner with VA (e.g., American Legion, Disabled American Vets, VFW) for volunteering, transportation to appointments, and advocating. Suggested putting it at the bottom of the page, below the benefit hubs.
- The link *"'mental health' isn't plain language. 'Need to talk to someone?' might be better" (p3).*

## Out of scope for home page redesign
- Two participants typed in many different search strings and got different result each time. They and others said that they wanted search to work better. Another participant didn't get any relevant results when they searched using the misspelling "benifits".
> *"What most Veterans search for should be the top results" (p4).*

> *"Depending on what my search terms are, see different results" (p4).*

- Participants often miss a relevant link when scanning through long pages with many links (e.g., disability or health care hub pages). Two participants spontaneously commented on specific content pages being too word heavy, including the education pages, the health care page, and the secure messaging page.
> *"There a lot of stuff to read through...there's a lot of reading here" (p4).*

> *"It is a lot of information, and it's overwhelming" (p11).*

- One participant using a smartphone said it was hard to read the small text on the VA health care page. They missed the "secure messaging" link while scanning the entire page several times but finally found it.
- One participant who was searching for disability rates used the new search box ("compensation chart") and saw search results from 2011 and also 2014. She opened the one from 2011 and said...
> *"Oh but this is from 2011--that's not current. Is the information on here current?" (p11).*
- One participant expected that everything on the home page would be in the megamenu, which didn't seem to be the case because they couldn't find a link about VA news. 
> *"Should be like a table of contents" [like a sitemap] (p1).*

- One participant observed that some of the articles on the [VA News page](https://news.va.gov/) aren't news but instead explaining benefits (e.g., [What is the difference between VA Life Insurance and Service-Disabled Veterans Life Insurance?](https://news.va.gov/109922/difference-va-life-insurance-sdvi/)). They said it should have only recent changes or updates (e.g., [VA closes gap in survivor benefits for LGBTQ+ Veterans and survivors](https://news.va.gov/109836/va-closes-gap-survivor-benefits-lgbtq-survivors/)).
- One participant (who was in a moving car) was frustrated with how slow it was to load VA.gov pages. 
- One pilot participant on a smartphone didn't expect the megamenu to be open to the last option that was opened, but it was. This is the same issue that was recently fixed on the desktop version of the megamenu but not on mobile, as reported in the last round of usability testing.
- One pilot participant on a smartphone thought it was strange that when you opened the Veterans Crisis Line link in the footer of the home page, closing the dialog returned you to the top of the page. They expected to return to the footer where they had opened the link.

# Recommendations
## For the home page redesign effort
1. Since valuable real estate at the top of the home page isn't being used much (benefit promo and *Create account* button), consider whether **more of the top of the home page could have the most used and useful items** (e.g., *Popular at VA.gov*, Search, *Other search tools*, and maybe the benefit hubs), rather than items with lower usage (e.g., benefit promo, *Create account* button). Maybe we could decrease the size of the PACT Act promo and the *Create account* area.
> *"Want in first view [at top], not scrolling scrolling scrolling...The most important things should be at the top or under the menu instead of scrolling" (p1).*
2. **Make links under *Popular on VA.gov* more task-oriented** with destinations that are different from the benefit hubs (whose descriptions mention exploring and applying), such as the following:
     1. Instead of "VA health care", "Manage my VA benefits" could open the sign-in dialog and then go to the authenticated *My Health* page.
     1. Instead of "Disability", "Apply for disability or a disability increase" could go to the disability application page.
     1. Instead of "Education", "Apply for education benefits" could go to the education application page. Alternatively, this could instead be another top task, such as "Check or update your current education benefits" or "Verify your monthly school enrollment", which would both open the sign-in dialog and go to the appropriate authenticated page for doing that task. 
4. **Add a link for the *GI Bill Comparison Tool* to *Other search tools*** because it's a search tool that was difficult for participants to find when trying to compare education benefits by school. Another idea is to link to a new content page that has _all_ education-related search tools, including *GI Bill Comparison Tool* and *Yellow Ribbon*.
5. **Make links under *Popular on VA.gov* more visually appealing** so they look less like unformatted footer links. This could include colors and/or icons (like the benefit hubs), or even just a carat in front of each link.
6. **Make the *More VA News* link more visually prominent** because it's not noticed by many people.
7. If we're going to keep the benefit promo on the home page, **add a header and a date or "new!" to the benefits promo box** so people know it's relevant to VA benefits and also current (i.e., "VA BENEFIT NEWS 11/4/2022", perhaps styled like the "VA NEWS" heading in the news promo). 
8. To potentially address the low successful completion rate for the *Message your doctor* task, work with the Health Apartment team to **find a more intuitive way for people to manage VA health care from the VA.gov home page**, or just leave health care managing tasks to the Authenticated/My VA page after users sign in.
9. **Add a Feedback button to the home page** because it's the only page on VA.gov that doesn't have one. Note that this recommendation isn't  suggested by data from this study but seems like a good idea.
     1. To fix the possible accessibility issue, consider **positioning the Feedback button on the *left* side of the page**, where it would be more noticeable for screen magnifier users while scanning down the left side of a page.


## Beyond the home page (out of scope but can discuss with other teams)  
1. **Fix the mobile version of the megamenu so that it always opens the same way, *without* the last option used already opened**. This issue was recently fixed on desktop, but the mobile version wasn't changed. Laura Flattery is following up on this issue, which will be added to a ticket with other improvements to the header.
2. **Change the "mental health" link in the footer to go to the modernized mental health page that the link in Popular goes to**, and add "mental health" to the megamenu under health care as another way to go there.
4. **Add "View or change dependent" to Family Member Benefits page**, as a search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation" for "spouse" and "dependent".
5. **Add "View disability rates" to megamenu under Disability**, as a search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation".
6. **Make clear on the disability application page that this form can be used to *increase your existing disability rating*** (i.e., add to heading "or increase your current rating").
1. **Talk to the team that works on the *Veterans Crisis Line*** to share the following two findings:
     1. The red button in the top right of VA.gov pages was invisible to a screen magnifier user on a computer. The button would likely be more visible if aligned with the left side of the page or if it extended all the way across the desktop version like it does on mobile.
     1. On a smartphone, opening the link in the footer and then closing the dialog returns you to the top of the home page instead of the footer where they were.
8. **Find and remove the two old disability compensation rate content pages from 2011 and 2014** so that they aren't found by site search. Danielle Thierry plans to followup with VBA about this published content on TeamSite.
10. Consider sharing feedback with OPIA about focusing on VA news (e.g., [VA closes gap in survivor benefits for LGBTQ+ Veterans and survivors](https://news.va.gov/109836/va-closes-gap-survivor-benefits-lgbtq-survivors/)) and not including non-news explanations of benefits (e.g., [What is the difference between VA Life Insurance and Service-Disabled Veterans Life Insurance?](https://news.va.gov/109922/difference-va-life-insurance-sdvi/)).

# Next Steps

- Present results to Sitewide Public Websites, Health Apartment, Authenticated Experience, and any other interested teams.

# Further research needed
1. Do **more usability testing with participants who don't have an account on VA.gov**. We'd like to learn about any expectations about having an account *vs.* not having one, and we'd like to see whether people know when to use the "Create account" vs. "Sign in" buttons. We also want to get user feedback on using the *Create account* button, which wasn't didn't happen in this study because all participants already had an account on VA.gov. See if there's any confusion after the button is selected, especially with the modal that has "Sign in" at the top and "Create an account" farther down.
2. Do **more usability testing with participants on mobile devices who are comfortable browsing websites from those devices**. In order to get more such participants, add a screener question for future studies: *How do you normally browse the web--on a smartphone, tablet/iPad, computer? (select as many as apply; recruit from those who mark smartphone)*
3. Do **more usability testing with participants using screen readers**. In order to get participants who will use screen readers during the research session, add a screener question for future studies: *Do you use a screen reader every time you browse the web? (recruit only if "yes")* 
4. Do **more usability testing with participants using screen magnifiers** (e.g., ZoomText) to find out whether parts of the home page are not visible to them, such as buttons for Create Account, Veterans Crisis Line, and Feedback. This would help us determine whether p7's difficulty with two of those buttons is shared by other screen magnifier users.
5. Do more research with participants using smartphones and/or check analytics to **see what proportion of people scroll past the top of the dark blue VA news promo section** to see whether this might be a new "false footer" for some users.
6. Do more **research that includes the header and footer** to learn more about Veterans' expectations of them as well as assessments of intuitiveness and usefulness of the links there.
