# Research Goals
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the *newly revised* version of the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page were used and how well it supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

Use of the VA.gov home page fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 

- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions
*Note: In this research plan, "successfully completing" a task means that a participant has navigated to a web page on VA.gov where they could do that task or sign in to do the task (participants did NOT sign in during the sessions).*
1. Are participants able to successfully complete tasks from the home page without getting stuck?
    1. For tasks previously assessed, how do task success rates compare to those in the first round of usability testing?
    2. For tasks previously assessed, how do task success rates compare to those in the baseline wayfinding study last year?
1. Which parts of the home page do participants use to complete tasks? 
    1. Benefit promo at top of page (PACT Act article)
    2. "Create account" button
    4. The new search box 
    5. "Other search tools" 
    3. "Popular on VA.gov"
    4. VA News promo (PathFinder article)
    6. Benefit hubs 
    9. Header (including Search, Sign in, VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu)
    10. Footer 
1. Do participants know when to use the "Sign in" *vs.* "Create account" buttons?
1. Is there anything that participants find unclear or confusing on the home page, especially when using a smartphone or a screen reader? 
1. What are participants' impressions of the two new promo sections (with PACT Act and Pathfinder news articles)?
    1. How would they get more details on these topics?
    1. How would they get stories on other topics? 

## Areas of focus
In this research, we were primarily interested in the following areas of the home page as used in task completion:
- Benefit promo (PACT Act article)
- "Create account" button
- The new search box
- "Other search tools"
- "Popular on VA.gov"
- VA News promo (PathFinder article)
- Benefit hubs

# Methodology 
We conducted **remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom**. Participants were asked a few questions about their experiences with VA benefits, and then were given some tasks as wayfinding prompts to explore the redesigned VA.gov home page on the Staging server. Some of the top tasks were listed in the "Popular on VA.gov" section of the redesigned home page, while others were not. Below is the complete list of 8 tasks:
1. Message your doctor
1. Show you're a Veteran (benefit letter or Veteran ID card)
1. Find mental health counselor/therapist
1. Find recent changes in benefits/services
1. Learn what else is new from the VA (news stories)
1. Add spouse (Review/update dependents)
1. Check current disability compensation rates
1. Compare education benefits by school
1. File for disability increase

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. The revised home page design will result in improved task success rates as compared to the first round of usability testing, especially including the tasks below.
    1. The 4 tasks with the lowest success rates:
        1. Check current disability compensation rates (60%)
        2. Compare education benefits by school (56%)
        3. Add spouse (Review/update dependents) (56%)
        4. File for disability increase (50%)
    2. The 2 tasks with lower success rates than last year's baseline wayfinding research:
        1. Message your doctor (83%)
        1. Add spouse (Review/update dependents) (56%) -- also listed above
1. There are no significant differences in task success rate across devices (especially smartphones) or screen reader users.
1. Participants will know when to use the "sign in" *vs.* "create an account" buttons.
1. The home page supports multiple ways of navigating, and participants will find a way to complete every task--i.e., there's a navigation path that works for them. 
1. Participants understand that the top promo is about benefits or services for Veterans.
1. Participants understand that the bottom promo is news and know how to get more news stories.

     1. PROBABLY FALSE: Most participants...

# Key Findings

# Details of Findings--REVISE!!!

## 1. 
**Most research participants used the AREAS** on the redesigned home page. Almost half of the participants used the new search box, and many fewer used the new "sign in or create account" button. No one clicked on the Vantage blog promo. Below you can see the different areas of the redesigned home page labeled, followed by the percentages of participants who used each area of the page.

A summary of the task completion and success rates for each task is shown below. 

![task-success&ratings]()

In comparing task success rates with last year's baseline wayfinding study, we see that 

For the 4 most problematic tasks, below are the primary reasons why they were difficult and what might help make them easier:

Task | Why Difficult | What Could Potentially Help
------------------|--------------|-----------
File for disability increase | **Link goes to application for disability that doesn't mention filing for an increase** | Make clear on [disability application page](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction) that this form can be used to increase your *existing* disability rating (i.e., add to heading "or increase your current rating")
Add a spouse (review/update dependents) | **Couldn't find by browsing** (7 of 19 tried megamenu or benefit hubs > Family member benefits), 1 didn't recognize links with the word "dependent" as relevant | Add "View or change dependent" to Family Member Benefits page, on the home page somewhere, as a search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation" for "spouse" and "dependent"
Compare education benefits by school | 5 of 19 **didn't notice "GI Bill Comparison Tool" in right rail of megamenu > Education and training** | Change link in megamenu to GI Bill Comparison Tool to make it look more like a hyperlink instead of an ad
Check current disability compensation rates | **Couldn't find by searching** (tried "disability pay") **OR browsing** (tried megamenu > disability, megamenu > pension, benefit hubs > pension) | Add "View disability rates" to megamenu under Disability, search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation"   

Participants struggled with some of the other tasks, too, as shown in the table below:
Task | Why Difficult | What Could Potentially Help
------------------|--------------|-----------
Message your doctor | **Couldn't find by browsing**, used to doing from MHV and not VA.gov | Add "Manage your VA health care" link to home page, which leads to secure messaging, appointment scheduling, prescriptions, lab results, etc.
Get VA medical history/records | **Couldn't find by browsing** (tried megamenu > health care) | Add "Get your VA medical records" to home page, to megamenu under Health care
Find mental health counselor/therapist | **Couldn't find by searching** (tried "therapist", "counselor") **OR browsing**| Add "mental health" to home page, to megamenu under health care, to search autocomplete suggestions, to search "top recommendation" for "therapist" and "counselor" and "therapy"
Update your address with VA | **Couldn't find by browsing** (tried benefit hubs) | Add "Update contact info" to Common tasks, and in the Records benefit hub

From the most frequently done tasks reported in the [Veteran Top Tasks Unmoderated Survey Findings research report from July 2022](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/research-findings.md), only two of those 5 tasks were included in this usability test. They're listed below with their success rates: 
- *Message your doctor* (83% completed successfully)
- *Check/update education benefits* (71% completed successfully)

e they would come across it would be best" (p22).*

## 7. **Additional usability feedback on the home page**
