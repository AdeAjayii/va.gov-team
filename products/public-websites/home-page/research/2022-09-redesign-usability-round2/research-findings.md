# Research Goals
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the *newly revised* version of the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page were used and how well it supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

Use of the VA.gov home page fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 

- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions
*Note: In this research plan, "successfully completing" a task means that a participant has navigated to a web page on VA.gov where they could do that task or sign in to do the task (participants did NOT sign in during the sessions).*
1. Are participants able to successfully complete tasks from the home page without getting stuck?
    1. For tasks previously assessed, how do task success rates compare to those in the first round of usability testing?
    2. For tasks previously assessed, how do task success rates compare to those in the baseline wayfinding study last year?
1. Which parts of the home page do participants use to complete tasks? 
    1. Benefit promo at top of page (PACT Act article)
    2. "Create account" button
    4. The new search box 
    5. "Other search tools" 
    3. "Popular on VA.gov"
    4. VA News promo (PathFinder article)
    6. Benefit hubs 
    9. Header (including Search, Sign in, VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu)
    10. Footer 
1. Do participants know when to use the "Sign in" *vs.* "Create account" buttons?
1. Is there anything that participants find unclear or confusing on the home page, especially when using a smartphone or a screen reader? 
1. What are participants' impressions of the two new promo sections (with PACT Act and Pathfinder news articles)?
    1. How would they get more details on these topics?
    1. How would they get stories on other topics? 

## Areas of focus
In this research, we were primarily interested in the following areas of the home page as used in task completion:
- Benefit promo (PACT Act article)
- "Create account" button
- The new search box
- "Other search tools"
- "Popular on VA.gov"
- VA News promo (PathFinder article)
- Benefit hubs

# Methodology 
We conducted **remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom**. Participants were asked a few questions about their experiences with VA benefits, and then
**EDIT**...were given some tasks June 2022](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/research-findings.md)) **as wayfinding prompts** to explore the redesigned VA.gov home page on the Staging server. Some of the top tasks were listed in the "Common tasks" section of the redesigned home page, while others were not. For the 5 tasks that were also used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates were compared to assess the home page redesign with the baseline (which is the current home page on Production). 
**LIST TASKS HERE**

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. The revised home page design will result in improved task success rates as compared to the first round of usability testing, especially including the tasks below.
    1. The 4 tasks with the lowest success rates:
        1. Check current disability compensation rates (60%)
        2. Compare education benefits by school (56%)
        3. Add spouse (Review/update dependents) (56%)
        4. File for disability increase (50%)
    2. The 2 tasks with lower success rates than last year's baseline wayfinding research:
        1. Message your doctor (83%)
        1. Add spouse (Review/update dependents) (56%) -- also listed above
1. There are no significant differences in task success rate across devices (especially smartphones) or screen reader users.
1. Participants will know when to use the "sign in" *vs.* "create an account" buttons.
1. The home page supports multiple ways of navigating, and participants will find a way to complete every task--i.e., there's a navigation path that works for them. 
1. Participants understand that the top promo is about benefits or services for Veterans.
1. Participants understand that the bottom promo is news and know how to get more news stories.

     1. PROBABLY FALSE: Most participants 

# Key Findings
1. **Most participants browsed (clicking links) without using the Search box at all or searched only when browsing didn’t work**. 

1. **Most participants' navigation of the home page often didn't include the entire page but only certain parts of it.** 
     1. Most research participants used the header, *Common tasks, Other search tools*, and the Benefit hubs on the redesigned home page. 
     1. Almost half of the participants used the new search box, and many fewer used the "sign in or create account" button. 
     1. **Most participants (79%) scrolled all the way down** the home page to the footer.

1. **Of the 20 top tasks tested, 9 tasks were completed successfully by *everyone* who tried them, 7 were completed by *most* who tried them, and 4 were completed by *only half* of those who tried them.** 
1. **Most sign-ins didn't happen on the home page** (with "Sign in or create an account" near the photos or "Sign in" in the header). 
1. **Two accessibility issues were discovered with the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu** on desktop, both of which confused a pilot participant using a screen reader, and one of which also confused several sighted participants.  

1. **No participants said anything about the Vantage blog promo box entitled "Updates on Veteran homelessness" nor clicked on it while doing tasks** (no tasks were related to it).


# Details of Findings 

## 1. Most participants browsed (clicking links) without using the Search box at all or searched only when browsing didn’t work
We observed 5 distinct **browse *vs.* search usage patterns** among the participants:
1. (7 participants) **Browsed exclusively** and never used search to complete tasks.
1. (7 participants) **Started browsing and later discovered the search box**. They were impressed with the results and then used search more after that.
2. (3 participants) **Mostly browsed but tried search once**.
4. (1 participant) **Tried search first, had success a couple times, then got irrelevant results, and so stopped using search**. This participant only browsed after that.
5. (1 participant) **Searched exclusively** to complete tasks. This was the youngest participant in this research; this same behavior was observed in our youngest pilot participant, whose data isn't included in this report even though he's a Reservist. The second youngest participant never searched but only browsed, so with only these 3 data points, we can't conclusively link young age to searching behavior. When the participant who was searching exclusively didn't find what he was looking for, he tried different search strings or browsed links on the page he got to, rather than browsing on the home page.

One participant said they were giving a lower task rating because they *"had to do a search for it" (p4).* Some participants said that they browse first and avoid searching because they
- Don't like to type into the search box
- It's easier to click on something 
- Figure they can find what they need by browsing the topics shown
 
Below is some specific feedback on using search:
- At least 4 participants clicked on one of the auto-complete suggestions.
- 2 participants were annoyed that VA.gov search isn't as forgiving with spelling mistakes as Google is (e.g., "benifits" isn't recognized as the same as "benefits").

>  Regarding browsing and then trying searching: *"I gave up [on browsing] and used the search...search is better to use* vs. *so much to read [on the home page]--a whole page that I have to read, when I should be depending on search" (p14).*

> *"Getting used to using search...working pretty good...autofill function...seems intuitive" (p4).* 

Of the participants who tried search, **9 of them used the new search box, which is more than the 6 who used the existing link** in the header.
   
## 2. **Most participants' navigation of the home page often didn't include the entire page but only certain parts of it** 
Some participants found **one way to navigate that worked for them, which they used it for most tasks**, ignoring other parts of the home page. Here are some **different browsing focus patterns** that we observed:
1. Only the *VA Benefits and Health Care* megamenu in the header
1. Only *Common tasks* and *Other search tools*
1. Only the benefit hubs
2. Only the search box
3. A combination of some of the above but usually not all

**Most research participants used the header, *Common tasks, Other search tools*, and the Benefit hubs** on the redesigned home page. Almost half of the participants used the new search box, and many fewer used the new "sign in or create account" button. No one clicked on the Vantage blog promo. Below you can see the different areas of the redesigned home page labeled, followed by the percentages of participants who used each area of the page. 

![home-pg-areas](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/images/home-pg-areas.png)
    
![home-pg-clicks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/images/home-pg-clicks.png)
   
**4 participants didn't notice *Common tasks*, but many others used these links.** Participants suggested adding more items to the list, including mental health, change address, message doctor, burial info, and the most frequent searches.

**2 participants didn't notice *Other search tools*, but many others used these links.** 
- Many participants said that the links in *Other search tools* are useful quick links to other pages but not necessarily what they expected as "search tools", such as filters to narrow a search. Other participants thought that the phrase "search tools" makes sense to describe search for specific things, such as a form or a facility, but "education benefits" isn't a search tool in the same way.
- The inclusion of "Yellow Ribbon" was problematic because half of the participants didn't know what it was, and some who did questioned why the link was separate from "Education benefits".
- Two participants wondered why "Find a VA facility" and "Education benefits" were in "Other search tools" because they're also in the header.

**A lot of participants used the benefit hubs, and some focused most of their attention on that section** of the home page. Some feedback from individual participants:
- Like the benefit hubs along with their different colored icons
- Looks like everything in the megamenu
- Want a miscellaneous category for other stuff they couldn't find elsewhere (e.g., travel reimbursement).
- "Housing assistance" doesn't make sense for home loans, so perhaps split it up into 2 different topics: "VA home loan" and "Housing assistance".

**Most participants (79%) scrolled all the way down** the home page to the footer. This is an improvement over the current home page on Production, which has a row of images that gives the false impression of being the bottom of the page. In the 2021 baseline wayfinding study, only two-thirds of participants scrolled past the images.

## 3. Of the 20 top tasks tested, 9 tasks were completed successfully by *everyone*, and 4 were completed by *only half* of those who tried them
Different participants took very **different paths to complete the same tasks**, which was possible because there are many ways to navigate from the home page to the same content page. **Each of the top 20 tasks tested in this research was attempted by 6-10 participants** with varying degrees of success:
1. **9 tasks (almost half) were completed successfully by *everyone*** who tried them, some more quickly than others.
1. 7 tasks were completed successfully by 70-90% of those who tried them.
1. **4 tasks were completed successfully by only half (50-60%)** of those who tried them. 

A summary of the task completion and success rates for each task is shown below. Participant success rates were *not* correlated by participant age, mobile *vs.* desktop, experience with VA.gov, or whether the task was about learning/applying *vs.* managing benefits.

![task-success&ratings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/images/task-success%26ratings.png)

In comparing task success rates with last year's baseline wayfinding study, we see that 3 tasks improved with the home page redesign, but the success of 2 tasks unfortunately decreased: *Message your doctor*, and *Add a spouse*.

For the 4 most problematic tasks, below are the primary reasons why they were difficult and what might help make them easier:

Task | Why Difficult | What Could Potentially Help
------------------|--------------|-----------
File for disability increase | **Link goes to application for disability that doesn't mention filing for an increase** | Make clear on [disability application page](https://www.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction) that this form can be used to increase your *existing* disability rating (i.e., add to heading "or increase your current rating")
Add a spouse (review/update dependents) | **Couldn't find by browsing** (7 of 19 tried megamenu or benefit hubs > Family member benefits), 1 didn't recognize links with the word "dependent" as relevant | Add "View or change dependent" to Family Member Benefits page, on the home page somewhere, as a search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation" for "spouse" and "dependent"
Compare education benefits by school | 5 of 19 **didn't notice "GI Bill Comparison Tool" in right rail of megamenu > Education and training** | Change link in megamenu to GI Bill Comparison Tool to make it look more like a hyperlink instead of an ad
Check current disability compensation rates | **Couldn't find by searching** (tried "disability pay") **OR browsing** (tried megamenu > disability, megamenu > pension, benefit hubs > pension) | Add "View disability rates" to megamenu under Disability, search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation"   

Participants struggled with some of the other tasks, too, as shown in the table below:
Task | Why Difficult | What Could Potentially Help
------------------|--------------|-----------
Message your doctor | **Couldn't find by browsing**, used to doing from MHV and not VA.gov | Add "Manage your VA health care" link to home page, which leads to secure messaging, appointment scheduling, prescriptions, lab results, etc.
Get VA medical history/records | **Couldn't find by browsing** (tried megamenu > health care) | Add "Get your VA medical records" to home page, to megamenu under Health care
Find mental health counselor/therapist | **Couldn't find by searching** (tried "therapist", "counselor") **OR browsing**| Add "mental health" to home page, to megamenu under health care, to search autocomplete suggestions, to search "top recommendation" for "therapist" and "counselor" and "therapy"
Update your address with VA | **Couldn't find by browsing** (tried benefit hubs) | Add "Update contact info" to Common tasks, and in the Records benefit hub

From the most frequently done tasks reported in the [Veteran Top Tasks Unmoderated Survey Findings research report from July 2022](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/research-findings.md), only two of those 5 tasks were included in this usability test. They're listed below with their success rates: 
- *Message your doctor* (83% completed successfully)
- *Check/update education benefits* (71% completed successfully)

e they would come across it would be best" (p22).*

## 7. **Additional usability feedback on the home page**

We heard some additional usability feedback on the home page and other VA.gov pages:
1. One participant suggested removing the 3 photos of Veterans because they *"don't do anything" (p14)*--i.e, you can't interact with them.
1. One participant said that there are too many clicks to get to information from the home page.
2. Two participants said that there's too much text on some of the VA.gov pages, for example, in the light blue box on the [Burial Eligibility page](https://staging.va.gov/burials-memorials/eligibility/).
1. About a quarter of the participants (5 of 19) said that they call the VA when they get stuck trying to find something on VA.gov.
1. One participant said that the **smallest font size was too small for them to read**. This text included the benefit hub descriptions and the common tasks listed. 

> *"Don't bury so many things so deep...[check education benefits] buried under too many clicks...want two clicks max...After two clicks I would stop because I don’t want to have to click five times to get to what I am looking for...search until I get tired, and then use the VA 800 number" (p9).*

> *"Makes you read a lot of stuff you shouldn't have to read" (p14).*

> *"I would scan it. I would eventually have to read it once I was frustrated" (p16).*
