# Research Plan for VA.gov Home Page Redesign ROUND 2 Usability Testing [Sitewide Home Page team, September 2022]

## Background
The current VA.gov website was launched in 2018 but hadn't been the subject of much user research until [Baseline Wayfinding Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md) was conducted in April 2021. Findings from this research and also from [Search Design Concepts Usability Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/research-findings.md) have been incorporated into a new VA.gov home page design.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
1. Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online 
1. Veterans can manage their health services online 
1. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online

### Veteran Journey
Use of the VA.gov home page fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to **get a second round of user feedback on the revision of the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We will observe which areas of the home page they use and how well it supports Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks. 

### Outcome
This research will inform iterations to the home page redesign, the need for future research, and release decisions.

### Research questions
*Note: In this research plan, "successfully completing" a task means that a participant has navigated to a web page on VA.gov where they could do that task or sign in to do the task (participants will NOT sign in during the sessions).*
1. Are ALL participants able to easily complete tasks from the home page? *("easily" = being able to figure out where to go and not get stuck)*
    1. For tasks that are the same as those from last year's baseline wayfinding research, how do success rates compare with last year? 
3. Which parts of the home page do participants use to complete tasks and how? Where do they go first?
    1. "Sign in or create account" button
    3. "Common tasks"
    4. The new search box (next to common tasks)
    5. "Other search tools" (next to common tasks)
    6. Benefit hubs (below search and common tasks)--Are they used at all?
    7. The main content of the page (between the header and footer)--Did they scroll all the way down the page?
    8. VAntage Point blog promo (below search and common tasks)
    9. Header (including Search, Sign in, VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu)
    10. Footer 
1. When do participants search (by typing into a box) *vs.* browse (clicking on links, like the benefit hubs)?
    1. Are there differences between browsing/learning tasks *vs.* managing tasks?
    2. Are there differences between people more *vs.* less familiar with VA benefits? 
3. Is there anything that participants find unclear or confusing on the home page? 
    1. Other search tools?
4. What are participants' expectations of the VAntage Point blog promo content?
    1. What content would be helpful to be there?
    2. How often should the content be refreshed?
3. Where do participants typically go to get information and benefits from the VA? (i.e., search engine, VA.gov, call VA, etc.)

### Areas of focus
In this research, we are primarily interested in the following areas of the home page as used in task completion:
- Login/signup CTA
- Common task list
- Search
- Benefit hubs
- VAntage Point blog promo

### Hypotheses
1. The prominent sign in/sign up location and CTA makes it easier for participants to easily sign in/sign up.
1. More participants will use the prominent sign in/sign up CTA than the button in the header.
1. The streamlined design enables participants to complete tasks efficiently. 
    1. For tasks that are the same as those used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates will be higher.
1. Participants will know to search for tasks not listed as "common tasks". 
1. Participants understand where "other search tools" links will take them and what they will find there.
1. A focused and prominently displayed VAntage Point blog promo increases participants' engagement with the content.
1. Participants will scroll all the way down the home page to the footer (even if they don't look at links in the footer). 
2. Most participants start with a search engine, not VA.gov.

## Method	
We will conduct **remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom**. Participants will be asked a few questions about their past usage of the VA.gov site, and then will be given some **Veteran top tasks** (per findings from the Veteran Top Tasks Unmoderated Survey in June 2022) **as 
wayfinding prompts** to explore the redesigned VA.gov home page on the Staging server. Some top tasks will be represented in the "common tasks" section of the redesigned home page, and others will not. For any tasks that were used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates will be compared to assess the home page redesign. 

Participants will be asked to complete some tasks based on which VA benefits they have experience with, per their responses to questions at the beginning of the session. Each participant will do a subset of the full list of tasks in the conversation guide. We will **track how many participants complete each task and make note of which tasks need to get prioritized in subsequent sessions**. If we're unable to find enough participants that meet the benefit qualification for a particular task, the backup plan is to ask any participant to do that task.

## Recruitment	

Ask Perigean to recruit **20 Veterans, Veterans' caregivers, Veterans' family members, and service members** in order to get **10 completed sessions** using the criteria below.

### Recruitment criteria
Add the total requested number, ideal completed sessions and breakdown type of participants for this study. 

`Ex. TR: 10; CS: 6; Vets: 5; Fam: 0; Care: 5; Serv: 0`

|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
|               |                  |        |             |          |               | 


### Criteria Table 
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

- If this is for a single ***MODERATED*** study, breakdown your total requested participants for each category by number--***not percentage*** in the moderated column. 
- ***This will be applied across particpant types you need*** (*Veterans, caregivers, etc.*) for all categories (*Sex, race, etc*) you select. 
- For example, if you request 10 particpants, for 5 Veterans, and 5 caregivers, you could ask for 5 males, 5 females, and Perigean will apply those numbers across those two particpant types. Do the same for any other category you want Perigean to use for recruitment.  
- If you're conducting an unmoderated study (*survey, tree test*) using cohorts, ***do not exceed*** nine participants per cohort to avoid PRA (Paperwork Reduction Act).
- Add which group you want applied to each cohort in the heading row (***Ex. Vet Cohort 1, Care Cohort 2, Fam Cohort 3, Serv Cohort 4***). 
- You can use the same group for all cohorts, but the categories you choose must vary (***Ex. Vet Cohort 1 [9 Male]; Vet Cohort 2 [9 Female]***.

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.

### Screener

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)


### Primary criteria (must-haves)
- At least 13 are Veterans
- At least 3 are Veterans' caregivers
- At least 2 are Veterans' family members
- At least 2 are service members
- 3 have NO experience with ANY VA benefit OR experience with ONLY ONE VA benefit *(see Additional Question #1 below)*
- 6 have NO experience with health care, but DO have experience with another VA benefit *(see Additional Question #1 below)*
- 4 have experience with health care and optionally with other VA benefits *(see Additional Question #1 below)*
- 10 people who plan to use their desktop or laptop computer for the session
- 10 people who plan to use their mobile device for the session 
- At least 7 people with a cognitive disability (e.g., TBI)
- At least 7 people who are age 55 or older
- At least 5 people 35 or under
- At least 3 people who use assistive technology on a daily or near-daily basis *(record which technologies from recruitment screener)*
- At least 5 people who have never used the VA.gov website before *(see Additional Question #2 below)*
- ALL have a computer, tablet, or smartphone and are willing to complete their interview on one of those devices:
  - During the session, are willing to share over Zoom a web browser window on their device
  - Have a working microphone on their device
  - Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen

### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
- At least 6 people of color
- At least 4 women
- At least 4 people who don't have any degree or vocational training after high school (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least 4 people who live in a rural or remote area

### Additional questions to ask in the screener
1. What VA benefits (if any) do you have experience with? For example, health care, education, career services, housing, home loan certificate of eligibility, pension, life insurance, burial benefits or memorial items. *(Note to Perigean: Please ask this question even though it's in the screener questionnaire because participants' answers may have changed since they filled out the questionnaire.)*
    1. Zero or one *(recruit 3)*
    1. Two or more NOT INCLUDING Health Care *(recruit 6)*
    1. Two or more INCLUDING Health Care *(recruit 4)*
    
1. Have you ever used the VA.gov website before?
    1. No *(recruit 5)*
    1. Yes
    1. Not sure
