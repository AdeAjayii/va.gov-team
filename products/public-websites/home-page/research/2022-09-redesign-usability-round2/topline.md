This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

# Introduction
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the *newly revised* version of the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page were used and how well it supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

# Participants
We talked to **11 participants: 9 Veterans, 5 Caregivers of a Veteran, 5 family members of a Veteran** (some had multiple roles) and **1 service member**. **
- 8 used a smartphone during the session (*vs.* 3 used a computer)
- 4 were visually impaired but none used screen readers during the sessions
- ALL had a VA.gov account
- ALL but one had VA health care

# PRELIMINARY Findings for the Home Page Redesign
1. As in the previous round of usability testing, some participants tended to **focus their attention on a specific part of the home page**--often either the header (2 on phones and 1 on desktop) OR the *Popular at VA.gov*, Search, and *Other search tools* (2 on phones). Others scrolled up and down the home page more continuously. 
      1. **Most participants (8 of 11) used the links in *Popular on VA.gov*.** Next most used were the header (7 of 11), benefit hubs (6 of 11), and footer (6 of 11). Fewer people used *Other search tools*, the two promos, and the new search box. No participants used *Create account* because all already had a VA.gov account. Below you can see the different areas of the redesigned home page with the percentages of participants who clicked on each area of the page. 
      1. One participant said they thought *Popular on VA.gov* was the bottom of the page because the text **looked so plain and unformatted** and so appeared to be links in the footer. Another participant also commented on how plain the *Popular on VA.gov* links looked, as compared to the benefit hubs, which each have a colored icon.
      1. We can compare the home page click results from this study with the [previous round of usability testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/redesign-usability/research-findings.md) and the last year's [Baseline Wayfinding study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md). From the comparison of the data from 3 research studies below, we can see that **people seem to be scrolling farther down the redesigned home page, now that the whole page is shorter. There are also more clicks on the benefit hubs and footer**, perhaps because participants aren't finding what they need farther up (because the "top 4" boxes are gone). A few caveats to consider about comparing the data from all 3 studies are listed below:
           1. There were fewer tasks in this study (8) than in the previous study (20) and the baseline wayfinding study (9). In this study, there were no tasks specifically geared towards *Other search tools* as in the previous study, but there were new tasks around VA news/benefit promos.
           1. There were fewer participants in this study (11) than in the previous study (19) and the baseline wayfinding study (13).

2. **Many participants got stuck on some of the tasks, and when that happened, most *didn't* try to use search**. 
     1. 10 of 11 participants got stuck on some task(s) during the sessions.
     1. Only 5 of 11 participants ever tried using search. The new search box was used by 3 of 11 participants, and 2 other participants used search in the header.
     1. 4 of the 5 people used search when they said they were stuck, and 2 of the 5 used it *every time* they were stuck.
     1. 2 people used search when they didn't appear to be stuck.
3. The **lowest task success rate was for the *Message your doctor* task**, and it was lower than the previous round of usability testing (**55%** this time *vs.* 83% before). 5 of 11 participants used the new *VA health care* link in *Popular*, but others were confused because they're accustomed to doing this task using MyHealtheVet. *SHOW SUCCESS & RATINGS summary*
     1. Three other tasks had low success rates: *Compare education benefits by school, Learn what else is new from the VA (news stories),* and *Add spouse (Review/update dependents)*.
     1. Below is the summary of all task success rates and participant ratings of ease: ![task-success&ratings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research/2022-09-redesign-usability-round2/images/task-success%26ratings.png)
4. Some participants didn't click on either of the promos. 
     1. Many participants (5 of 11) **didn't think that the PACT Act article was about a change in benefits** and scrolled down past it. We don't know why people didn't use it, but it may have been because it looks like a banner ad or hero image at the top of the page, and/or because they thought looked like news rather than benefit changes (as stated in the user task).
     2. Four participants didn't notice the *More VA News* link.
     3. One participant said that VA News is *"just taking up space and not helping with a task" (p11)*. 
5. Some participants (3 of 11) went to the **search tool *Find benefit resources and support* when they were unsure of where else to look** (e.g., for recent benefit changes, news stories, proof of Veteran status).
1. **Only one participant mentioned being bothered by the duplicate links in *Popular on VA.gov* and the benefit hubs**. No one else said anything, perhaps because they were unable to able to see *Popular on VA.gov* and the benefit hubs on their screen at the same time.
> *"Mimicking, waste of space, not to the point" (p2)*.
7. Most participants (9 of 10) were able to successfully complete the "show you're a Veteran" task, and so **having no task-oriented links for Veteran ID cards and benefit letters seems OK**. 
1. **No one expressed any interest in the email newsletter**, though this wasn't an area of focus for this research, nor was there a task about it. Two participants shared that they already receive some kind of email newsletters from the VA.
> *"I probably would get spammed with a zillion emails or a newsletter" (p3)*.
> 
> *"I wouldn't come here [to VA.gov] just to look for information on benefits" (p9, who receives emails from the VA "all the time" and visits VA.gov when he wants to check on his benefits, submit a claim, or manage his medical care).*

# PRELIMINARY Recommendations to consider for the Home Page Redesign
Is there anything compelling enough from the findings that we should consider changing anything in the home page redesign?
1. Since valuable real estate at the top of the home page isn't being used much (benefit promo and *Create account* button), consider whether **more of the top of the home page could have the most used and useful items** (e.g., *Popular at VA.gov*, Search, *Other search tools*, header, and maybe the benefit hubs), rather than for items with lower usage (e.g., benefit promo, *Create account* button). Maybe shrink the size of the PACT Act promo and the *Create account* area.
2. **Make links under *Popular on VA.gov* more task-oriented** with destinations that are different from the benefit hubs (with information about applying), such as the following:
     1. Instead of "VA health care", "Manage my VA benefits" could open the sign-in dialog and then go to the authenticated My Health page.
     1. Instead of "Disability", substitute "Apply for disability or a disability increase", which goes to the disability application page.
     1. Instead of "Education", substitute "Apply for education benefits", which goes to the education application page. Alternatively, this could instead be another top task, such as "Check or update your current education benefits" or "Verify your monthly school enrollment", which would both open the sign-in dialog and go to an appropriate authenticated page for managing your education benefits. 
4. **Add a link for the *GI Bill Comparison Tool* to *Other search tools*** because it's a search tool and was difficult for participants to find.
5. **Make links under *Popular on VA.gov* more visually appealing** so they look less like unformatted footer links. Potential suggestions: colors/icons (like the benefit hubs), or even just a carat in front of each link.
6. **Make the *More VA News* link more visually prominent** because it's not noticed by many people.
7. **Add a header and a date or "new!" to the benefits promo box** so people know it's relevant to VA benefits and also current (i.e., "VA BENEFIT NEWS 11/4/2022" like the "VA NEWS" heading in the news promo).
8. To potentially address the low successful completion rate for the *Message your doctor* task, work with the Health Apartment team to **find a more intuitive way for people to manage VA health care on VA.gov**, or just leave health care managing tasks to the Authenticated/My VA page after users sign in.
9. **Add a Feedback button to the home page** because it's the only page on VA.gov that doesn't have one.
