# Research Goals
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the *newly revised* version of the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page were used and how well it supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

# Participants
**11 participants**
- 8 on smartphone (*vs.* 3 on desktop)
- 4 visually impaired but none used screen readers during the sessions
- ALL had VA.gov account
- ALL but one had VA health care

# PRELIMINARY Findings for the Home Page Redesign
1. As in the previous round of usability testing, some participants tended to **focus their attention on a specific part of the home page**--often either the header (2 on phones and 1 on desktop) OR the *Popular at VA.gov*, Search, and *Other search tools* (2 on phones). Others scrolled up and down the home page more continuously. 
      1. **Most participants (8 of 11) used the links in *Popular on VA.gov*.** Next most used were the header (7 of 11), benefit hubs (6 of 11), and footer (6 of 11). Fewer people used *Other search tools*, the two promos, and the new search box. No participants used *Create account* because all already had a VA.gov account. *SHOW VISUAL of home page w/percentages*
      2. One participant said they thought *Popular on VA.gov* was the bottom of the page because the text looked so plain and unformatted and so appeared to be links in the footer. Another participant also commented on how plain the *Popular on VA.gov* links looked, as compared to the benefit hubs, which each have a colored icon.
6. **Many participants got stuck on some of the tasks, and when that happened, most *didn't* try to use search**. 
     1. 10 of 11 participants got stuck on some task(s) during the sessions.
     1. Only 5 of 11 participants ever tried using search. The new search box was used by 3 of 11 participants, and 2 other participants used search in the header.
     1. 4 of the 5 people used search when they said they were stuck, and 2 of the 5 used it *every time* they were stuck.
     1. 2 people used search when they didn't appear to be stuck.
3. The **lowest task success rate was for the *Message your doctor* task**. 5 of 11 participants used the new *VA health care* link in *Popular*, but others were confused because they're accustomed to doing this task using MyHealtheVet. *SHOW SUCCESS & RATINGS summary*
1. Some participants didn't click on either of the promos. 
     1. Many participants (5 of 11) **didn't think that the PACT Act article was about a change in benefits** and scrolled down past it. We don't know why people are not using it, but it might be because it looks like a banner ad or hero image.
     2. Four participants didn't notice the *More VA News* link.
     3. One participant said that VA News is *"just taking up space and not helping with a task" (p11)*. 
2. Some participants (3 of 11) went to the **search tool *Find benefit resources and support* when they were unsure of where else to look** (e.g., for recent benefit changes, news stories, proof of Veteran status).
3. **Only one participant mentioned being bothered by the duplicate links in *Popular on VA.gov* and the benefit hubs**. No one else said anything, perhaps because they were unable to able to see *Popular on VA.gov* and the benefit hubs on their screen at the same time.
> *"Mimicking, waste of space, not to the point" (p2)*.
7. Most participants (9 of 10) were able to successfully complete the "show you're a Veteran" task, and so **having no task-oriented links for Veteran ID cards and benefit letters seems OK**. 
8. No one expressed any interest in the email newsletter. 
> *"I probably would get spammed with a zillion emails or a newsletter" (p3)*.

# PRELIMINARY Recommendations to consider for the Home Page Redesign
Is there anything compelling enough from the findings that we should change something in the home page redesign?
1. Consider whether **more of the top of the home page could have the most used and useful items** (e.g., *Popular at VA.gov*, Search, *Other search tools*, header, and maybe the benefit hubs), rather than for items with lower usage (e.g., benefit promo, *Create account* button). Maybe shrink the size of the PACT Act promo and the *Create account* area.
2. **Make links under *Popular on VA.gov* more visually appealing** so they look less like unformatted footer links. Potential suggestions: colors/icons (like the benefit hubs), or even just a carat in front of each link.
3. **Make the *More VA News* link more visually prominent** because it's not noticed by many people.
4. **Add a header and a date or "new!" to the benefits promo box** so people know it's relevant to VA benefits and also current (i.e., "VA BENEFIT NEWS 11/4/2022" like the "VA NEWS" heading in the news promo).
6. Work with the Health Apartment team to **find a more intuitive way for people to manage VA health care on VA.gov**, or decide to leave manage tasks to the Authenticated/My VA team after users sign in.
7. **Add a Feedback button to the home page** because it's the only page on VA.gov that doesn't have one.
