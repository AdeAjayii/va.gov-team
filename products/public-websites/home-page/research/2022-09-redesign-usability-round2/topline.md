# Research Goals
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the *newly revised* version of the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page were used and how well it supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

# PRELIMINARY Findings for the Home Page Redesign
**11 participants**
- 8 on smartphone (vs. 3 on desktop)
- 4 visually impaired but none used screen readers during the sessions
- ALL had VA.gov account
- ALL but one had VA health care
1 As in the previous round of usability testing, some participants tended to **focus their attention on a specific part of the home page**--often either the header (2 on phones and 1 on desktop) OR the Popular at VA.gov, Search, and Other search tools (2 on phones). Others scrolled up and down the home page more. 
      1. **Most participants (8 of 11) used the links in *Popular on VA.gov*.** Next most used were the header (7 of 11), benefit hubs (6 of 11), and footer (6 of 11). Fewer people used *Other search tools*, the two promos, and the new search box. No participants used *Create account* because all already had a VA.gov account. *SHOW VISUAL of home page w/percentages*
6. **Most people *don't* search every time get stuck**. Only 5 of 11 participants ever tried using search, and not always when they got stuck. 
     7. The new search box was used by 3 of 11 participants, and 2 other participants used search in the header.
     1. 4 of 5 people used search when they said they were stuck, and 2 of 5 used it *every time* they were stuck.
     3. 2 used it when they didn't appear to be stuck.
     4. 10 of 11 participants got stuck on some task(s) during the sessions, and only 1 of them tried searching *every time* they were stuck.
3. The **lowest task success rate was for the *Message your doctor* task**. 5 of 11 participants used the new *VA health care* link in *Popular*, but others were confused because they only do this task using MyHealtheVet.
1. Many participants (5 of 11) **didn't think that the PACT Act article was about a change in benefits**.
2. Some participants (3 of 11) went to **search tool *Find benefit resources and support* when they were unsure of where else to look** (e.g., for recent benefit changes, news stories, proof of Veteran status).
3. Only one participant mentioned being bothered by the duplicate links in *Popular* and the benefit hubs. No one else said anything, perhaps because they were unable to able to see *Popular* and the benefit hubs on their screen at the same time.
5. Removing the task-oriented links for Veteran ID cards and benefit letters seems OK, as most participants (9 of 10) were able to successfully complete the "show you're a Veteran" task.

# PRELIMINARY Recommendations to consider for the Home Page Redesign
Is there anything compelling enough from the findings that we should change something in the home page redesign?
1. Consider whether more of the top of the home page could be used for the most used and useful items (e.g., *Popular at VA.gov, Search, and Other search tools, header)* rather than for items (e.g., benefit promo, *Create account* button) with a less usage.
1. Add a Feedback button to the home page because it's the only page on VA.gov that doesn't have one.
2. Add a heading and a date to the benefits promo box so people know it's relevant to benefits and current (e.g., "BENEFIT NEWS 11/4/2022" like the "VA NEWS" heading in the news promo.
3.
