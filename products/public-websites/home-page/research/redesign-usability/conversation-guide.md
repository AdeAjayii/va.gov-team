## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes. 

There are a few of my teammates who would like to watch this session. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If yes, let them in. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

*(For sessions with a participant using a screen reader:)* Angela is also in this meeting to help with any technical issues that may arise with your use of a screen reader during this session.

Today we're going to talk about some things that you might do with the VA.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We're testing a survey to learn how we can make it easier to do. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- I'd like to record my screen and audio as we talk today to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. We won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to your name or any information that could identify you. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" or "Share URL" (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
 
## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

- I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. How would you prefer to receive the URL?
  - I could dictate it to you, or put it in the Zoom chat. *NOTE how to share URL: dictate / Zoom chat* 

- What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)*

- *(If using assistive technology:)* 
  - How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen reader--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?
  - How long have you been using a screen reader?

- What VA benefits, if any, do you have experience with?
  - *RECORD: health care / education / career services / disability / housing loans / pension / life insurance / burial benefits / __________*

- What VA benefits that you *don't* have experience with might you be interested in exploring?
  - *RECORD: health care / education / career services / disability / housing loans / pension / life insurance / burial benefits / __________*

- Where do you typically go to get information and benefits from the VA?
  - *(Google / Facebook / MHV / eBenefits / Contact center call or email / VA.gov / ________________________)*

- Can you tell me about the last time you were looking for information or trying to do something with your VA benefits? 

## Tasks
Now I'm going to ask you to do a number of things that you may or may not have done before. For each task, I will stop you at a point when I feel like we've done enough, and I won't ask you to sign in.

I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, what you like, what you dislike, and what you're unsure about. 

### Screen sharing
I have a web page that I'd like you to look at while you're sharing your screen with me over Zoom.

While you're looking at the page, I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. 

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on **bit.ly/3Ix90HN**  
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test.)*

Do you see the link? 

I would like you to share your screen with me--a web browser please. You might want to close any apps that you don’t want me to see.
- *(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*

  - What are your thoughts on what you see here in this section of the page?   
  - What kind of information would be helpful to show here?
  - How often should the information be changed?

## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.
