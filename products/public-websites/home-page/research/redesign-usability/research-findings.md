# Research Goals
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the redesigned VA.gov home page** and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page were used and how well it supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

Use of the VA.gov home page fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 

- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions
*Note: In this research plan, "successfully completing" a task means that a participant has navigated to a web page on VA.gov where they could do that task or sign in to do the task (participants will NOT sign in during the sessions).*
1. Are ALL participants able to easily complete tasks from the home page? *("easily" = being able to figure out where to go and not get stuck)*
    1. For tasks that are the same as those from last year's baseline wayfinding research, how do success rates compare with last year? 
3. Which parts of the home page do participants use to complete tasks and how? Where do they go first?
    1. "Sign in or create account" button
    3. "Common tasks"
    4. The new search box (next to Common tasks)
    5. "Other search tools" (next to Common tasks)
    6. Benefit hubs (below search and Common tasks)--Are they used at all?
    7. The main content of the page (between the header and footer)--Did they scroll all the way down the page?
    8. VAntage Point blog promo (below search and Common tasks)
    9. Header (including Search, Sign in, VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu)
    10. Footer 
1. When do participants search (by typing into a box) *vs.* browse (clicking on links, such as the benefit hubs)?
    1. Are there differences between browsing/learning tasks *vs.* managing tasks?
    2. Are there differences between people more *vs.* less familiar with VA benefits? 
3. Is there anything that participants find unclear or confusing on the home page? 
    1. Other search tools?
4. What are participants' expectations of the VAntage Point blog promo content?
    1. What content would be helpful to be there?
    2. How often should the content be refreshed?
3. Where do participants typically go to get information and benefits from the VA? (i.e., search engine, VA.gov, call VA, etc.) 

## Areas of focus
In this research, we were primarily interested in the following areas of the home page as used in task completion:
- Login/signup CTA
- Common task list
- Search
- Benefit hubs
- VAntage Point blog promo

# Methodology 
We conducted **remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom**. Participants were asked a few questions about their experiences with VA benefits, and then will be given some **Veteran top tasks** (per [Veteran Top Tasks Unmoderated Survey findings from June 2022](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/research-findings.md) **as wayfinding prompts** to explore the redesigned VA.gov home page on the Staging server. Some of the top tasks were listed in the "Common tasks" section of the redesigned home page, while others were not. For any tasks that were used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates will be compared to assess the home page redesign with the baseline (current design on Production). 

Participants were asked to complete some tasks based on which VA benefits they had experience with, per their responses to questions at the beginning of the session. **Each participant did a subset of the full list of 20 tasks in the conversation guide**, and for each, we recorded whether they were successful and also their ease rating on a scale from 1-5. Over the course of the sessions, we tracked how many participants completed each task and prioritized tasks that hadn't been completed by as many participants yet in order to get feedback on each task from at least 4 participants (we surpassed this goal by ending up with each task completed by at least 6 people).

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. The prominent sign in/sign up location and CTA makes it easier for participants to easily sign in/sign up.
1. More participants will use the prominent sign in/sign up CTA than the button in the header.
1. The streamlined design enables participants to complete tasks efficiently. 
    1. For tasks that are the same as those used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates will be higher.
1. Participants will know to search for tasks not listed as "common tasks". 
1. Participants understand where "other search tools" links will take them and what they will find there.
1. A focused and prominently displayed VAntage Point blog promo increases participants' engagement with the content.
1. Participants will scroll all the way down the home page to the footer (even if they don't look at links in the footer). 
2. Most participants start with a search engine, not VA.gov.

    2. PARTLY TRUE:

# Key Findings
## Navigation
1. **Most participants browsed (clicking links) without using the Search box at all or searched only when browsing didn’t work**. 

1. **Most participants' navigation of the home page often didn't include the entire page but only certain parts of it.** 
     1. Most research participants used the header, *Common tasks, Other search tools*, and the Benefit hubs on the redesigned home page. 
     1. Almost half of the participants used the new search box, and many fewer used the "sign in or create account" button. 
     1. **Most participants (79%) scrolled all the way down** the home page to the footer.

1. **Of the 20 top tasks tested, 9 tasks were completed successfully by *everyone* who tried them, 7 were completed by *most* who tried them, and 4 were completed by *only half* of those who tried them.** 
1. Several participants said that it was **redundant or confusing to have two different sign-in buttons** ("Sign in or create an account" near the photos in addition to "Sign in" in the header). 
1. Some participants had **difficulty using the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu because it didn't work as expected** since one dropdown option was already expanded upon opening--either the first option (Health care) or the one last opened.  

## Content
1. **No one said anything about the Vantage blog promo box entitled "Updates on Veteran homelessness" or clicked on it while doing tasks**


# Details of Findings 

## Navigation
1. **Most participants browsed (clicking links) without using the Search box at all or searched only when browsing didn’t work**. We observed 4 distinct **browse *vs.* search usage patterns** among the participants:
     1. More than a third of participants (37%, or 7 of 19) **browsed exclusively** and never used search to complete tasks.
     1. More than a third of participants (37%, or 7 of 19) **started off browsing and later discovered the search box**. They were impressed with the results and then used search more after that.
     1. Only our youngest participant **searched exclusively** to complete tasks. (This same behavior was observed in our youngest pilot participant, whose data isn't included in this report even though he's a Reservist.) The second youngest participant never searched but only browsed, so with only these 3 data points, we can't conclusively link young age to searching behavior. When the participant who was searching exclusively didn't find what he was looking for, he tried different search strings or browsed links on page he went to, rather than browsing on the home page.
     1. One participant **tried search first, had success a couple times, and then got irrelevant results, so stopped using search**. This participant only browsed after that.

Some participants said that they browse first and avoid searching because they
- Don't like to type into the search box
- It's easier to click on something 
- Figure they can find what they need by browsing the topics shown

One participant said they were giving a lower task rating because they "had to do a search for it" (p4).
    
>  Regarding browsing and then trying searching: "I gave up [on browsing] and used the search...search is better to use *vs.* so much to read [on the home page]--a whole page that I have to read, when I should be depending on search" (p14).
   
1. **Most participants' navigation of the home page often didn't include the entire page but only certain parts of it.** Some participants found **one way to navigate that worked for them, which they used it for most tasks**, ignoring other parts of the home page. Here are some **different browsing focus patterns** that we observed:
     1. Only the *VA Benefits and Health Care* megamenu in the header
     1. Only *Common tasks* and *Other search tools*
     1. Only the benefit hubs
     2. Only the search box
     3. A combination of some of the above but usually not all

**Most research participants used the header, *Common tasks, Other search tools*, and the Benefit hubs** on the redesigned home page. Almost half of the participants used the new search box, and many fewer used the "sign in or create account" button. No one clicked on the Vantage blog promo. Below you can see the different areas of the redesigned home page labeled, followed by the percentages of participants who used each area of the page. 
- [INSERT IMAGE](TBD) 
- [INSERT IMAGE](TBD) 
   
**Most participants (79%) scrolled all the way down** the home page to the footer. This is an improvement over the current home page on Production, which has a row of photos that gives the false impression of being the bottom of the page.

1. Different participants took very **different paths to complete the same tasks**, which was possible because there are many ways to navigate from the home page to the same content page. **Each of the top 20 tasks tested in this research was attempted by 6-10 participants** with varying degrees of success:
     1. **9 tasks (almost half) were completed successfully by *everyone*** who tried them, some more quickly than others.
     1. 7 tasks were completed successfully by 70-90% of those who tried them.
     1. **4 tasks were completed successfully by only half (50-60%)** of those who tried them. 

A summary of the task completion and success rates for each task is shown below (INSERT SCREENSHOT OF RATINGS TABLE).

For the 4 most problematic tasks, below are the primary reasons why they were difficult and what might help make them easier:

Task | Why Difficult | What Could Potentially Help
------------------|--------------|-----------
File for disability increase | **Link goes to application for disability that doesn't mention filing for an increase** | Make clear on disability application page that this form can be used to increase your existing disability rating (i.e., add to heading "or increase your current rating")
Add a spouse (review/update dependents) | **Couldn't find by browsing** (megamenu, benefit hubs > Family member benefits), didn't recognize links with the word "dependent" as relevant | Add "View or change dependent" to Family Member Benefits page, on the home page somewhere, a search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation" for "spouse" and "dependent"
Compare education benefits by school | **Didn't notice "GI Bill Comparison Tool" in right rail of megamenu > Education and training** | Change link to comparison tool look like a hyperlink instead of an ad
Check current disability compensation rates | **Couldn't find by searching** ("disability pay") **OR browsing** (megamenu > disability, megamenu > pension, benefit hubs > pension) | Add "View disability rates" to megamenu under Disability, search autocomplete suggestion, and a search "top recommendation"   

Participants struggled with some of the other tasks, too, as shown in the table below:
Task | Why Difficult | What Could Potentially Help
------------------|--------------|-----------
Message your doctor | **Couldn't find by browsing** | Add "Manage your VA health care" link to home page, which leads to secure messaging, appointment scheduling, prescriptions, lab results, etc.
Get VA medical history/records | **Couldn't find by browsing** (megamenu > health care) | Add "Get your VA medical records" to home page, to megamenu under Health care
Find mental health counselor/therapist | **Couldn't find by searching** ("therapist", "counselor") **OR browsing**| Add "mental health" to home page, to megamenu under health care, to search autocomplete suggestions, to search "top recommendation" for "therapist" and "counselor" and "therapy"
Update your address with VA | **Couldn't find by browsing** (benefit hubs) | Add "Update contact info" to Common tasks, and in the Records benefit hub

1. Several participants said that it was **redundant or confusing to have two different sign-in buttons** ("Sign in or create an account" near the photos in addition to "Sign in" in the header). 
     1. A quarter of the participants (5 of 19) said that they'd sign in first--before using the home page--so they'd see customized links or wouldn't get interrupted later to sign in and then have to figure out how to get back to where they were.
     2. One participant said that they didn't think to sign in because they primarily use the VA mobile app, in which you stay signed in.

3. Several participants had **difficulty using the VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu because it didn't work as expected** since one dropdown option was already expanded upon opening--either the first option (Health care) or the one last opened. **Participants expect to see all dropdown options and select one before corresponding content is opened.** One participant wanted to see the dropdown options but skipped health care because it was already open. A different participant didn't open the Disability option because they didn't realize that the Health care option was already open. A third participant was surprised by seeing Burial and Memorials still open from the previous time they opened the megamenu and had expected to choose which dropdown option to expand. In addition, this interaction was confusing for our pilot participant who uses a screen reader.

1. We heard some additional usability feedback on the home page and other VA.gov pages:
     1. One participant suggested removing the 3 photos of Veterans because they "don't do anything" (p14)--i.e, you can't interact with them.
     1. One participant said that there are too many clicks to get to information from the home page.
     2. Two participants said that there's too much text on some of the VA.gov pages, for example, in the light blue box on the [Burial Eligibility page](https://staging.va.gov/burials-memorials/eligibility/).
     3. About a quarter of the participants (5 of 19) said that they call the VA when they get stuck trying to find something on VA.gov.

> "Don't bury so many things so deep...[check education benefits] buried under too many clicks...want 2 clicks max...After two clicks I would stop because I don’t want to have to click 5 times to get to what I am looking for...search until I get tired, and then use the VA 800#" (p9).

> "Makes you read a lot of stuff you shouldn't have to read" (p14).

> "I would scan it. I would eventually have to read it once I was frustrated" (p16). 

1. There were **two accessibility issues** identified during the usability testing:
     1. One participant said that the **smallest font size was too small for them to read**. This text included the benefit hub descriptions and the common tasks listed. 
     2. Our pilot participant who uses a screen reader noticed that **focus was on the side nav menu instead of the H1** on the [Education eligibility page](https://staging.va.gov/education/eligibility/) when the page is opened.

### Content
8. **No one said anything about the Vantage blog promo box entitled "Updates on Veteran homelessness" nor clicked on it while doing tasks**. During the post-task interview, participants were asked about it, and it was interpreted in various ways:
     1. Many participants **didn't realize that the Vantage box entitled "Updates on Veteran homelessness" was a news article and thought it featured an important VA benefit for homeless Veterans**. Some Veterans said it should be featured more prominently on the page, and some wanted to see how VA is helping. Other participants thought that homeless Veterans may not see this information because they wouldn't have a computer or Internet access. It was a particularly emotional issue for one Veteran, who got teary while discussing her thoughts.
     
     2. **Those who noticed the "All VA News" link in the box thought it would be more information about homelessness, or questioned why it was there at all because it had nothing to do with the homelessness benefit information.**
     4. Two participants recognized the Vantage box as news, which they didn't care to look at on the home page. Two different participants suggested showing news articles in a rotating carrousel so they might be enticed to click on one.
     5. **One participant said they thought it was a banner ad and so ignored it.**
     1. Two participants said they didn't know what "PIT Count" means (it's "Point In Time" count). 
     1. One participant thought the picture looked staged and also misleading because it appears to be about food, not housing.
     1. One participant said that the homeless information isn't not that useful to anyone in the Philippines because they have no access to these programs overseas.
     3. **When asked what other types of content should be shown in this section, several participants said they wanted information about recent legislation enacted (e.g., burn pit registry), changes in VA benefits or procedures, or specific VA benefits (e.g., education, disability/claims, housing loans, local Veterans homeless shelters or mobile assistance units).** 

> "Why would I scroll all the way down to homelessness to get to the news?" (p4).

> "There are homeless Veterans on every corner...in my community...no one's helping them. Have to fight to get disability...They've already done that, got denied, and there's no fight left in them...It is hard for me to believe they [VA] are doing much of anything to help...To see how they are pushed to the side. I am not sure if they are getting the help or not accepting the help...I want to see see how VA is actually helping...I want to see the people out there actually caring for those Veterans" (p9). 

> "Many Vets don't know that VA can help" (p11, who writes down the 800 number and gives it to homeless Veterans).

> "If it looks like a banner ad, I'd be more likely to ignore it...trained to ignore banner ads" (p22).

> "I hate the photograph--What's in the bag? Getting free food? Not housing assistance but food assistance" (p14). 



3. Almost half of the participants **didn't know what "Yellow Ribbon" means**, which was listed under the heading "Other search tools".


## Other Findings


### Feedback for VA

We heard some feedback specifically for VA, which is listed below but not analyzed because it's outside the scope of this study:
1.   

# Recommendations
1. Keep the search box because many more participants found it and used it as compared to search in the header.
2. Make sure that all top tasks can be accomplish via both searching and browsing in order to support people who only search or only browse.
3. Consider the following revisions to the Common tasks and Other search tools sections:
     1. ...
4. Consider removing the "Sign in or create account" button because most participants were accustomed to using the "Sign in" button in the header and some were confused by seeing a second button. This screen real estate may be better used by a link or verbiage to do VA health care tasks.
6. Consider moving the Vantage blog promo down below the benefit hubs so it doesn't interrupt the user's navigation flow among search, other search tools, and common tasks.
7. Consider changing the megamenu interaction to be more like a standard dropdown in which all options are shown whenever it's opened *without any of the options already expanded until after the user selects one.*
8. Check the font size of the text of the benefit hub descriptions and the list of common tasks and consider enlarging it. The current minimum font size for VA.gov is 16px, but Gov.UK recommends 19px for older populations, which we should consider. 

# Next Steps

- Present results to Sitewide Public Websites, Health Apartment, Authenticated Experience, and any other interested teams.
- For tasks that were difficult to do, discuss possible design changes to the redesigned home page to make them easier, and then do another round of usability testing.
