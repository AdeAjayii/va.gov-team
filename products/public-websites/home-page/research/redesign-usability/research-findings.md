# Research Goals
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on the redesigned VA.gov home page and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page they used and how well it supported Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

Veteran tasks fit into the Veteran journey throughout their lives:

- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

## Who we heard from 

**Recruitment criteria**

We wanted to include Veterans and others who had a diverse range of experience with VA benefits and services, including some whose experience doesn't include VA health care, and some who had no experience at all with VA benefits.

**19 participants** 

Audience segments:
* Veterans:  16
* Family members of a Veteran: 2 
* Caregivers: 1

Note that the percentages add up to more than 100% because many people have more than one role (e.g., a Veteran who's also a family member of another Veteran).
