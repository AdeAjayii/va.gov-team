This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on the redesigned VA.gov home page and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page they used and how well it supports Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

## Participants
We talked to **19 people: 16 Veterans, 1 Caregiver of a Veteran, 2 family members of a Veteran** (one was also a Veteran and the other was also a Caregiver), and **2 service members**. 
- 17 had experience with at least 2 VA benefits.
- 3 had experience with VA benefits that didn't include VA health care.
- 1 had experience with only one VA benefit, which was education (a service member).
- 1 had experience with NO VA benefits (the other service member).

## Preliminary Findings
### Navigation
1. **Most participants browsed (clicking links) without using the Search box at all or searching only when browsing didnâ€™t work**. There were 4 distinct **browse vs. search usage patterns** observed among the participants:
     1. Many participants *browsed exclusively* to complete tasks.
     2. Only our youngest participant (plus one young pilot participant) used *searching exclusively* to complete tasks. 
     3. Some participants who *started off browsing and later discovered the search box* were impressed with the results and then used search more. 
     4. Other participants *tried searching, got irrelevant results, and gave up on search* so only browsed.
5. Participants' browsing of the home page often didn't include the entire page but only certain parts of it. Some participants found one way to navigate that worked for them, and then they used it for most of the tasks. Here are **different browsing patterns** that were observed:
     1. Only the benefits megamenu in the header
     1. Common tasks and Other search tools
     1. Benefit hubs
     1. A combination of some of the above but usually not all
7. **Most participants (79%) scrolled all the way down** the home page to the footer.
8. Different participants took very **different paths to complete the same tasks**, which was possible because there are many ways to navigate from the home page to the same content page.
9. Each of the top 20 tasks tested in this research were attempted by 6-10 participants. 
     5. Nine (almost half) were completed successfully by ALL those who tried them, some more quickly than others.
     6. Eight were completed successfully by 70-90% of those who tried them.
     7. Three were completed successfully by just over half (56-60%) of those who tried them.

### Content
1. Many participants didn't realize that the Vantage news about Veteran homelessness was a news article and thought it was about much-needed VA help for homeless Veterans. Those who noticed the "All VA News" link thought it would be more about homelessness or had nothing to do with the homelessness benefit information.
1. Almost half of the participants **didn't know what "Yellow Ribbon" means**, which was listed under the heading "Other search tools".


## Next Steps
