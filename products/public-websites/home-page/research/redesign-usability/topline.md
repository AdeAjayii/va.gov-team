This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on the redesigned VA.gov home page and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We observed which areas of the home page they used and how well it supports Veterans, VA beneficiaries, those acting on behalf of Veterans, and service members while completing important benefit-related tasks.

## Participants
We talked to **19 people: 16 Veterans, 1 Caregiver of a Veteran, 2 family members of a Veteran** (one was also a Veteran and the other was also a Caregiver), and **2 service members**. 
- 17 had experience with at least 2 VA benefits.
- 3 had experience with VA benefits that didn't include VA health care.
- 1 had experience with only one VA benefit, which was education (a service member).
- 1 had experience with NO VA benefits (the other service member).
