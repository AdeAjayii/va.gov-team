# Research Plan for VA.gov Home Page Redesign Usability Testing [Sitewide Home Page team, July 2022]

## Background
The current VA.gov website was launched in 2018 but hadn't been the subject of much user research until [Baseline Wayfinding Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding#baseline-wayfinding-research-on-vagov-april-2021) was conducted in April 2021. Findings from this research and also from [Search Design Concepts Usability Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/research-findings.md) have been incorporated into a new VA.gov home page design.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
- Veterans, caregivers, family members, and service members are able to access tools and processes quickly and easily to learn about and manage their benefits
- Veterans, caregivers, family members, and service members have increased access to self-service tools through an elevated login funnel

### Veteran Journey
Use of the VA.gov home page fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on the redesigned VA.gov home page and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page. We will observe which areas of the home page they use and how well it supports Veterans, VA beneficiaries, and those acting on behalf of Veterans while completing important benefit-related tasks. 

### Outcome
This research will inform iterations to the home page redesign, the need for future research, and release decisions.

### Research questions
1. Are participants able to easily and quickly initiate tasks from the home page?
    1. For tasks that are the same as those from last year's baseline wayfinding research, how do success rates compare with last year? 
3. What part(s) of the home page do participants use to complete tasks?
    1. "Sign in or create account" button
    3. "Common tasks"
    4. The new search box (next to common tasks)
    5. "Other search tools" (next to common tasks)
    6. Benefit hubs below search and common tasks
    7. The main content of the page (between the header and footer)--scrolled all the way down the page?
    8. VAntage Point blog promo (below search and common tasks)
    9. Header, including Search, Sign in, VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu 
    10. Footer 
1. Does the home page support participants, including those using assistive technology, in completing their tasks?
1. Do the words/labels used on the home page support participant understanding?
1. What do participants expect from various areas of the home page, including search functionality and the VAntage Point blog promo?

### Areas of focus
We are primarily interested in the following areas of the home page, in context with the header or footer, which may provide a path for task completion:
- Login/signup CTA
- Common task list
- Search
- Benefit hubs
- VAntage Point blog promo

### Hypotheses
1. The prominent sign in/sign up location and CTA makes it easier for Veterans to easily sign in/sign up.
1. More Veterans will use the prominent sign in/sign up CTA than the button in the header.
1. The streamlined design helps Veterans complete tasks more efficiently. 
    1. For tasks that are the same as those used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates will be higher.
1. The new design includes the most common/important Veteran-facing tasks.
1. The link labels are sufficient for Veterans to understand and use them.
1. Veterans will know to search for tasks not listed as most common. 
1. Veterans understand where "other search tools" links will take them and what information they will find there.
1. A focused and prominently displayed VAntage Point blog promo increases Veteran engagement with the content.
1. Participants will scroll all the way down the home page to see the footer. 

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom. Participants will be asked a few questions about their past usage of the VA.gov site, and then will be given some Veteran top tasks (per findings from the Veteran Top Tasks Unmoderated Survey in June 2022) as 
wayfinding prompts to explore the redesigned VA.gov home page on the Staging server. Some top tasks will be represented in the "common tasks" section of the redesigned home page, and others will not. For any tasks that were used in last year's baseline wayfinding research, task completion rates will be compared to assess the home page redesign.

*ACTION ITEM: Top tasks identified from the Veteran Top Tasks Unmoderated Survey should be incorporated into the home page redesign in the "common tasks" section.*
