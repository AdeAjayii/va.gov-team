# Research Plan for VA.gov Home Page Redesign Usability Testing [Sitewide Home Page team, July 2022]

## Background
Since the launch of VA.gov in 2018, the range of VA benefits and programs has grown and evolved, which has resulted in the addition of new capabilities and content to the VA.gov site. The VA.gov home page needs to enable Veterans and others to find the information and benefits they need and facilitate getting them to a personalized logged-in experience. [User research studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites/home-page/research) have been conducted on the current VA.gov home page, and the findings have helped inform a redesign of the home page.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

### Veteran Journey
Use of the VA.gov home page fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on the redesigned VA.gov home page and assess whether the design changes have improved the usability of the home page for Veterans and other users of VA benefits/services for completing benefit-related tasks.

### Outcome
The feedback we get on the home page redesign will be used to refine it before launch.

### Research questions
1. Are users able to accomplish all of the tasks from the home page?
1. What part(s) of the home page do users interact with?
    2. Sign in button
    3. The common tasks listed
    4. The new search box (next to the common tasks)
    5. The "other search tools" (next to the common tasks)
    6. Benefit hubs (which ones?)
    7. The entire main content of the page (between the header and footer)
    8. The VAntage Point blog promo (below search and common tasks)
1. What works well for users of the redesigned home page?
1. What issues do users encounter with the redesigned home page?
1. What are participants' expectations for the new VAntage Point blog promo?
    1. What kinds of content do they expect to see there?
    2. How often do they expect to see the content change? 

### Hypotheses
1. Participants can complete all the tasks using the redesigned home page.
2. Participants will notice, understand, and use the common task links.
3. Participants will use Search or other search tools if what they want to do isn't in the common task links.

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated usability sessions via Zoom. Participants will be asked a few questions about their past usage of the VA.gov site, and then will be given some common Veteran tasks as wayfinding prompts to explore the redesigned VA.gov home page on the Staging server.

*ACTION ITEM: Top tasks identified from the Veteran Top Tasks Unmoderated Survey should be incorporated into the home page redesign in the "common tasks" section.*

## Recruitment	

Ask Perigean to recruit 20 Veterans, Veterans' caregivers and family members, survivors, and service members in order to get 12 completed sessions using the criteria below.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]


**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? TBD Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: TBD

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: TBD

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 
Please request enough dates and time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.).
