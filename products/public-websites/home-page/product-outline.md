# Product Outline

## Overview

The VA.gov home page is an important tool for helping Veterans easily find the support they need. It’s also an important way to communicate to Veterans and the broader public the VA’s singular focus on Veteran wellbeing. 

*Note: this product outline is being written several years post-launch. Our current purpose is to kick off an initiative to update the home page in order to improve Veterans’ ability to find the tasks they’re looking for and improve their overall experience.

## Desired User Outcomes

We want Veterans who land on the Home Page to find their way to the services or support that they need in the most efficient and accessible way possible. Moving forward, we believe that driving Vets to log in will deliver the best and most personalized experience.
