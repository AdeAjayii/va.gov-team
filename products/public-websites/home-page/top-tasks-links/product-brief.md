## VA.gov Home Page Evolution Product Brief

Conceived as the unifying "Veteran-facing digital brand" for the Department of Veteran Affairs when it launched in late 2018, VA.gov has become **the** front-door to top tasks, tools and information for Veterans and their beneficiaries.  In the nearly three years since the site's launch, the range of VA benefits and programs has grown and evolved, with new valuable offerings.  Cases in point: (a) the new [Manage Your VA Debt hub](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/) and (b) [File a decision review](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/).  In a sense, the site now has to serve more masters -- and more importantly, VA.gov has to act as a vital guide-post to a growing selection of new information and benefit services.

What's more, VA.gov has advanced its authenticated experience -- e.g. MyVA, MyProfile, eBenefits migration, and soon MyHealthevet integration -- to a point where the site needs to more effectively bridge users to the personlized logged-in experience.

With this in mind, this Product Brief outlines -- at a high level -- three possible stages of the evolution of VA.gov.


### (1) Managing Home Page Top Tasks

[Comprehensive user research conducted for the 2018 VA.gov home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-gov-relaunch-2018/user-research/brand-consolidation-research-summary-10-25-2018.pptx) determined that the "benefit category is the default mental model for organizing information, but top tasks are why users come to va.gov."  These findings drove the final design which has fundamentally remained unchanged since launch.

In particular, the current UX design was optimized for viewability across Desktop and Mobile and that is why the four Top Tasks boxes contain a fixed number of five links in each = 20 tasks total.

And not surprisingly, [update-to-date click-tracking analytics and user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) reveals the Top Tasks section of the Home Page attracts the lion's share of user engagement.

In recent months, VA.gov has received a number of requests to add more links to the Home Page -- some related to [benefits/top tasks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/26276), some not -- as an example [this request to feature VA videos on the homepage.)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/28193)

**What Problem Needs to be Solved**

As an OCTO-DE product owner, I need a defensible framework for adding -- and not adding -- new links to the VA.gov Home Page so I can (a) feature the most valuable Veteran facing tasks, tools and content; and (b) more effectively manage stakeholder requests.


**Solutions to be Considered**

After conversations with key OCTO-DE product and design leads, two solution options have been identified:

- Create a rubric that establishes a baseline "score" for links to earn placement on the Home Page. 

[VA.gov HP Links Scorecard.xlsx](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/6919371/VA.gov.HP.Links.Scorecard.xlsx)


- Leverage "A/B testing" in production to determine if newly-proposed links perform better than existing links.  This will ensure we make data-informed decisions. (Approach preferred by Ryan Thurwell)


### (2) Refresh the Home Page 

Does the current VA.gov home page -- now nearly three years old -- meet the evolving needs of its users and the ever-changing entity it represents?  Not only are there new stakeholder demands, but user expectations may be changing as well.  The three year mark 


### (3) Unifying the Auth/Unauth Experience
