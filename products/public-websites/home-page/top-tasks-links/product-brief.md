## Home Page Top Tasks Links Product Brief


  
For this initiative, we will implement a series of functional, UX and CMS-based authoring enhancements that will more fully mature the Outreach Hub events calendar product, making it more personalized and useful for VA.gov users and easier to curate-manage by VA business stakeholders.


## The Problem to be Solved

How might we make the [Outreach Hub events calendar](https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/events/) more personalized for users (e.g. find events by date, time, event type, etc.) and easier to manage/curate for VA business users.

  
## Proposed Solution(s)

**High Level User Story/ies**

- As a Veteran user, I need to quickly find VA events of most interest based on a variety of search goals: date, time, location, event type, etc.
- As a VACO digital comms content editor, I need to curate events (including create, modify, duplicate, categorize for filtering) in the VA.gov CMS in the most efficient way possible.


## User Stories

**As a user:**
  
- I want to search for events by date (month, day) and time so that I know what's happening based on my schedule/availability. 
- I want to search for events by location so that I know what's happening in my area (e.g. at my VAMC).
- I want to search for events by type so that I know what's happening in-person vs. online/virtual
- I want to search for events by interest/need so that I know if there events of special interest to me (e.g. about VA benefits, about VA education, about VA Community Care etc.)
- I want to search for events based on my status (Veteran, beneficiary, care-giver, etc.) so that I can find events of special interest to me.


## What Needs to Be Done

**In Short-term (by Aug. 6)**

- [ ] Review this outline with Dave/Kev for "fleshing out"
- [ ] Identify next iteration of product enhancement work -- CMS AX experience, front-end user experience (e.g. how will filtering work from a user/UX perspective?)
  

*Take into consideration Accessibility/QA needs as well as Product, Technical, and Design requirements.*
