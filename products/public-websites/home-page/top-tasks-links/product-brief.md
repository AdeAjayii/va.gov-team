## VA.gov Home Page Evolution Product Brief

Conceived as the unifying "Veteran-facing digital brand" for the Department of Veteran Affairs when it launched in late 2018, VA.gov has become **the** front-door to top tasks, tools and information for Veterans and their beneficiaries.  In the nearly three years since the site's launch, the range of VA benefits and programs has grown and evolved, with new valuable offerings.  Cases in point: (a) the new [Manage Your VA Debt hub](https://www.va.gov/manage-va-debt/) and (b) [File a decision review](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/).  In a sense, the site now has to serve more masters -- and more importantly, VA.gov has to act as a vital guide-post to a growing selection of new information and benefit services.

What's more, VA.gov has advanced its authenticated experience -- e.g. MyVA, MyProfile, eBenefits migration, and soon MyHealthevet integration -- to a point where the site needs to more effectively bridge users to the personlized logged-in experience.

With this in mind, this Product Brief outlines -- at a high level -- three possible stages of the evolution of VA.gov.


### Managing Home Page Top Tasks

[Comprehensive user research conducted for the 2018 VA.gov home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-gov-relaunch-2018/user-research/brand-consolidation-research-summary-10-25-2018.pptx) determined that the "benefit category is the default mental model for organizing information, but top tasks are why users come to va.gov."  These findings drove the final design which has fundamentally remained unchanged since launch.

In particular, the current UX design was optimized for viewability across Desktop and Mobile and that is why the four Top Tasks boxes contain a fixed number of five links in each = 20 tasks total.

And not surprisingly, [update-to-date click-tracking analytics and user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) reveals the Top Tasks section of the Home Page attracts the lion's share of user engagement.

In recent months, VA.gov has received a number of requests to add more links to the Home Page -- some related to [benefits/top tasks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/26276), some not -- as an example [this request to feature VA videos on the homepage.)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/28193)

**What Problem Needs to be Solved**

As an OCTO-DE product owner, I need a defensible framework for adding -- and not adding -- new links to the VA.gov Home Page so I can (a) feature the most valuable Veteran facing content and (b) more effectively anage stakeholder requests.




### Refreshing the Home Page





### Unifying the Auth/Unauth Experience

## The Problem to be Solved

How might we make the [Outreach Hub events calendar](https://www.va.gov/outreach-and-events/events/) more personalized for users (e.g. find events by date, time, event type, etc.) and easier to manage/curate for VA business users.

  
## Proposed Solution(s)

**High Level User Story/ies**

- As a Veteran user, I need to quickly find VA events of most interest based on a variety of search goals: date, time, location, event type, etc.
- As a VACO digital comms content editor, I need to curate events (including create, modify, duplicate, categorize for filtering) in the VA.gov CMS in the most efficient way possible.


## User Stories

**As a user:**
  
- I want to search for events by date (month, day) and time so that I know what's happening based on my schedule/availability. 
- I want to search for events by location so that I know what's happening in my area (e.g. at my VAMC).
- I want to search for events by type so that I know what's happening in-person vs. online/virtual
- I want to search for events by interest/need so that I know if there events of special interest to me (e.g. about VA benefits, about VA education, about VA Community Care etc.)
- I want to search for events based on my status (Veteran, beneficiary, care-giver, etc.) so that I can find events of special interest to me.


## What Needs to Be Done

**In Short-term (by Aug. 6)**

- [ ] Review this outline with Dave/Kev for "fleshing out"
- [ ] Identify next iteration of product enhancement work -- CMS AX experience, front-end user experience (e.g. how will filtering work from a user/UX perspective?)
