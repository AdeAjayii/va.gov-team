# Intiative Briefing: New VA.gov Mobile Header

## Outcome Summary
Since the launch of VA.gov in late 2018, the site has featured one responsive Global header element that was **not optimized for Mobile view.**  
As a result, for our growing base of Mobile users, issues with the current header include:

- Consumes too much space, pushing down the most important element on the page (based on usage): the top tasks links (Proven during Veteran Research Study)
- Some of the exposed navigational elements cause user confusion -- e.g. the Crisis Line logo was mistaken for a hamburger menu on mobile per user research
- Too many chevrons in the top right corner with all acting differently, causing confusion
- Top spacing and inconsistent search engagement. 

## The Problem to be Solved

* Problem Defined: How might we make the Mobile version of VA.gov easier to scan and use, while preserving important links in an intuitive way?

* Evidence to support Prolem: Mobile usage is up, however site navigation via mobile is low to include mobile search, during a recent wayfinding research study it was idenfied that certain pain points existed on Mobile that could be enhanced to improve the UX.  A full comparison of Desktop Vs. Mobile is vaualble in determining common tasks across each device, along with what top tasks lend themselves more to desktop (e.g. form completion) and those on mobile (e.g. navigation). 

* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
     * This is occuring likely due to the context rich pages in the benefit hubs that are likely creating "content roadblocks" for Veterans to complete intented tasks. In addition to the large left hand navigational menu (mega menu) as it was proven that the smaller navigational menu is easier to navigate and provides a quicker path for users to interact with and follow.  
     * [Baseline analytics] 
     * Veterans were asked in a recent research wayfinding session what they didn't like about VA.gov, almost half of the participants said that it was difficult to find what you need, especially when it isn't in the "top 4" boxes. "A lot of things I can't find on mobile".  
      
 
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
     * VA North Star: Increase the usage and throughput of VA services 
     * VA North Star: Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - There is measurable value to Veterans as we are replacing "content roadblocks" and "content spirals" caused on mega menu with a clear navigational path that increases conversion rates for Tier 1 benefit actions. 
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  -  Only 2% of users were clicking on the right rail navigation because for most users(on desktop, tablet, and mobile), media queries forced that section to the bottom of the page, even on desktop.
  -  Mega Menu is too exstensive and not "straightforward" leading Veterans down content spirals and not down the intended "direct paths" for service completion tasks. 
  -  Scoping the navigational paths to be "three-click rule" compliant could help user find itended supporting content that would lead to an informed benefit action providing a clear conversion paths from the benefit hubs to the benefit action spoke. 
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - This page will be easy to refactor, requiring no complex technical integration with APIs.  This will however require strong colaboration accross VFS teams to ensure any technical udpates don't affect current codebase, node counts or future release plans. A primary focus will be placed on stability and common code elements for troubleshooting efforts forward.  
- **Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - This optimization will apply some much needed streamlining for navigational strategies along with user flow and conversion paths as related to the benefit hubs. Risk/constraint to consideer will be ensuring no disruptions to the current veteran expereince in applying for benefit actions (servicability needs to remain stead and active).  A secondary contraint will be to ensure user flow and conversion paths are fully tested with Veterans through exstensive user testing to ensure optimization of pathways and flows meet desired outcomes.
