## New VA.gov Mobile Header

Since the launch of VA.gov in late 2018, the site has featured one responsive Global header element that was **not optimized for Mobile view.**  
As a result, for our growing base of Mobile users, issues with the current header include:

- It consumes too much space, pushing down the most important element on the page (based on usage): the top tasks links.
- Some of the exposed navigational elements cause user confusion -- e.g. the Crisis Line logo was mistaken for a hamburger menu on mobile per user research
- Too many chevrons in the top right corner with all acting differently, causing confusion

## The Problem to be Solved

**How might we make the Mobile version of VA.gov easier to scan and use, while preserving important links in an intuitive way?**

## Proposed Solution(s)

## Hypothesis or Bet

**If** we implement a Mobile optimized sitewide header **then** we will increase usage of Top Task links on the Home Page without significantly impacting discoverability/usage of Search from that navigational component.
