## New VA.gov Mobile Header

TBD


## The Problem to be Solved

**How might we make the process of creating or updating a VA.gov Home Page banner easier, faster and less risk-prone?**


## Proposed Solution(s)

**High Level User Story/ies**

As a content editor, I need to quickly publish error-free alerts on the VA.gov homepage at all hours, so that time sensitive information can reach Veterans.


**Requirements**



## Hypothesis or Bet

**If** we create a more robust, systematic approach to enabling HP banner alerts **then** we will reduce the litany of high profile risks (availability, timeliness, content errors) which exist now.


## Definition of done

**For Short Term Solution (Goal: Put in place by Sept. 1)**

- [ ] Set meeting with Platform for collaboration on improving communication, response, redundancy and speed to publish issues/gaps.
- [ ] Create tickets for solutioning

**For Mid Term Solution (Goal: Implement by Oct. 1)**

- [ ] Confirm recommended UX changes with Ryan T.
- [ ] Create ticket for backlog and implementation

**For Long Term Solution (Goal: Implement in Q1/2022)**

- [ ] Determine LOE for CMS solution and where it fits based on other CMS priorities
- [ ] Create ticket for backlog(s)
