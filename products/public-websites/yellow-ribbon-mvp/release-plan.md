# Release Plan Yellow Ribbon MVP
WIP
---

Phase 1: Yellow Ribbon Participating Schools page available for Stakeholders' UAT/Feedback on staging

Phase 2/Go Live: Launch Yellow Ribbon Participating Schools page available on production
The new tool is available on production, and tested that it works as intended. At this point, the tool is available but 'hidden' from users unless they have the URL.
When the tool has been verified:
- Content changes (removing accordions, replace with link to tool), update entry points and navigation
- Redirect the 2020 static legacy pages to the new tool
- Note: we will not be able to redirect previous years



## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: [April 2020 - 05/06/2020] or [duration]
- Desired number of users: Stakeholders for the Yellow Ribbon initiative
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: VA's Yellow Ribbon contacts
- How you'll conduct the testing: on staging.va.gov
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: Stakeholders have been using staging.va.gov to review the tool

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing

### Planning:
- Desired date range: 
- Desired number of unique users: 
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: 
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers):


### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

More phases? Sure! If it makes sense for your product! Plan them out with the same structure as above.

## Go Live!
We will deploy the new tool to production, and test that functionality, design is as expected. At this point, the tool is available but 'hidden' from users unless they have the URL.

- Redirect the 2020 static legacy pages to the new tool
- Note: we will not be able to redirect previous years

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
