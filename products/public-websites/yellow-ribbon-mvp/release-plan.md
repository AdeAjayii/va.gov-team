# Release Plan Yellow Ribbon MVP
WIP
---
Phased roll-out:
Phase 1: Yellow Ribbon Participating Schools page available for Stakeholders' UAT/Feedback on staging

Phase 2: "Soft Launch" Yellow Ribbon Participating Schools page available on production
- Content changes, redirects not applied to other YR pages

Phase 3: Redirects and content updates implemented, opening access/discoverability to page

Are there SEO implications if we have it available on production but no redirects/content updates in place?


## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: [April 2020 - 05/08/2020] or [duration]
- Desired number of users: Stakeholders for the Yellow Ribbon initiative
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: VA's Yellow Ribbon contacts
- How you'll conduct the testing: on staging.va.gov
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: the work will be available to stakeholders on staging.va.gov and not on production. 

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing

### Planning:
- Desired date range: [05/11/2020 - 05/15/2020]
- Desired number of unique users: Link shared with VA's Yellow Ribbon stakeholders.
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: 
The page will be available, accessible on the production site. Redirects, content updates that will point to the page will not be implemented, limiting the discoverability. 
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers):
Track the new search refinements, to educate on user's behavior and inform future research, development for solution(s) for database-driven table content. Includes:
* Search refinements before and after initial search
* Exits to schools' websites

### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

More phases? Sure! If it makes sense for your product! Plan them out with the same structure as above.

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
