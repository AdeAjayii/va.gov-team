**How might we make the Veteran experience of starting online applications more seamless and successful?**


## Solution



## High Level User Story/ies

- As a user, I need to apply for the correct benefit online in a way that is quick, easy and ideally error-proof.

## Requirements


## Hypothesis or Bet

**If** the Wizards are moved to the application page **then**  there will be a reduction in the number of ineligible/incorrect applications received by VA benefits administrators.

## OKR

_Drive more online use of benefits applications as they are more discoverable, resulting in more correct or eligible applications received_
 - Increase usage of how to apply wizards
 - Reduced bounce rate from wizards
 - Reduction in number of "incorrect" applications received (veterans are applying for the wrong benefits because they are not using the gating wizards.

_Success Metrics Note:_  The Analytics team is recommending the tagging/tracking approach already taken with the education benefits wizard -- e.g. GA can report on “Started Education How To Apply - Did not Complete [Funnel Segment]” --  a good proxy for success if we apply this across the HLR and Disability wizards as well. The KPI would be to show reduced bounce rate on the Wizards – implying that a more informed veteran would then be prepared to apply (e.g. reduction in ineligibles).

## Definition of done

The how to apply wizards are live in production across the identified pages, resulting in reduced Wizard bounce rates.
