## Overview
Currently, search tools such as the main Search page, Find a Form, Find a Yellow Ribbon School, Resources & Support, and Facility Locator all have different UI styling. Our intent is to create UI consistency using the current style guide for all of the listed search tools.  A longer-range hope is that these new design elements will be incorporated into new search tools, and into existing tools as teams have the capacity to do so.

## Problem Statement
Having an inconsistent UI style for each of the search tools creates confusion for Veterans. 
In order to improve the UI style for Veterans we need to apply a clear and consistent styling across all tools.

 
## Desired User Outcomes

- A consistent UI is a better experience for Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates as it allows them to form one mental model that carries across each tool that follows the same design pattern.
- Consistent calls to actions (links, buttons, downloads) enables users to quickly recognize these elements as they are encountered on different tools, provding a more accessible experience for those with congnitive disabilities.
- Users click on calls to action more frequently because they are easier to recognize on the page.
- Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates are more quickly and easily able to access the content, forms, documents, facilities, or other resources they need.

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Users don't click on calls to action because the iconography or labeling us unclear. 
- Users don't click on calls to action because their designs do not stand out in the overall page design.
- Users with disabilities are not afforded an accessible experience due to improperly labeled elements, lack of tags for aural browsers, improper use of elements, improper tagging, or the depednence on color for meaning.
- PDF downloads result in errors or confusing messages.


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates use the search tools more.
- Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates take advantage of the resources they are searching for.
- Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates are less likely to call for support.


## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates lost trust and confidence in VA.gov search tools.
- Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates fail to click calls to action because they are unsure what will happen.
- Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates call in or visit a facility for assistance because they encounter an error or confusing message.
- Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates call in or visit a facility for assistance because their search does not yield clear calls to action.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
