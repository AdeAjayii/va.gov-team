    - I'll be curious of Josh's feedback on the hover.
    - Cristabell provided the icons.
    - Cassandra purposely picked the longest link 
    - Search term is one of the smallest thing on the page.
    - Cassandra will change the label to "Go to Online Tool"
- They will upload to inVision and share that link in the request ticket.
- There is opportunity for these changes to be applied to Yellow Ribbon
   - Button on YR is green, doesn't have a search icon
- Instructions on Find a VA Form - should those be re-displayed when the results are show?
- Point out lack of consistency in collapsing elements into a menu
- Intro text should still be displayed on Resources & Support when you initially land on the page

## 2021-04-09

#### Topic
- Design intent review
- Overview of project scope
- Current status of each design
- Date for design intent review
- Documents needed

#### Notes
- Brief scope overview
- Cassandra's update
    - Headers do need to be updated to have a link underneath per Josh Kim's feedback
    - There will be a separate ticket for R&S mobile per John to make it match the other mobile

- Megan's update
    - Adding an underline as well
    - Has also noticed there's a width difference

- Leyda's update
    - They did an audit for link styles and buttons
    - They did a review of the Facility Locator - font style differences; pretty minor
    - They probably align the least we well for some of the layout stuff.  Don't use the same form library

- Design Intent Review Timing
    - I have not put the request in yet; they ask for a date and time. 
    - Leyda needs probably another week
    - Early the week after next.

- Michelle - questions, concerns?
    - Are VAMC pages in scope?  
    - Leyda identified all the buttons that needed to be changed
    - Link styles - gets a little muddy. It's a decision we need to make. Do they want to update all the VAMC pages?
    - Marci asked if it would it be reasonable to just do a representative page for VAMC with the various pieces that could potentially appear.
    - Facility locator input field is currently bold.  Style guide is to unbold.

#### Decisions
- Implementation of the UI changes will be done as each team prioritizes and has bandwidth to roll them into their products. 

#### Action Items
- Complete Product Outline (Marci)
- Schedule design intent review (Marci)
- Gather design artifacts (Marci, Cassandra, Megan, Leyda)
