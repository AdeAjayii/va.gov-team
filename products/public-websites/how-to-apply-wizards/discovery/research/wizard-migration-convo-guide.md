## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding the right form when you want to apply for education or disability benefits on VA.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes.** This is a prototype that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - X minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Have you ever applied for benefits through a form on VA.gov before?

- What was that experience like?

  

## First Task: Edu wizard scenario 1 - 8 minutes

DRAFT NOTES: initially thinking of setting this up to guide people to 1990, and then task 2 would go to 1990N, but maybe we just let it be more organic and wherever people go, we just guide them to the next scenario on the 2nd task

- I'm going to send you a link to the prototype, and then have you share your screen.

  *Send user link to prototype, starting on How to Apply education page*

- Imagine you wanted to go to use your education benefits, and you made your way to this page.  Show me what you'd do from here to start that process.

  **If needed**:

  - Guide participant to `how to apply` button
  - Guide participant to complete wizard to trigger 1990 outcome

- How did that experience line up with what you expected? 

- Do you feel like those questions took you to the right place?

### Things to watch for:

- How easily does the participant find the `how to apply` button, and go to the wizard?
- Does the participant notice they were sent to a form start page (1990) from the How to Apply page?
- How easily does the participant complete the wizard?
- [Etc]

## Second Task: Starting Over - X minutes

**From intro / subway map page:**

- Now imagine you wanted to apply for one of the other education programs the VA offers (e.g. National Call to Service or the Edith Norse STEM scholarship). How would you go back and find the form for one of those?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant notice the text link to start over?

## Third Task: Edu wizard scenario 2 - X minutes

- Step 1
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Question 1
- Question 2
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
