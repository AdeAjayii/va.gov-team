## Research Goals 

This research was to test proposed changes to the wizard flow, which impacts both BAM teams, BAH team, and Public Websites.

## Research Methodology 

This study was a remote, moderated usability test planned by Liz Lantz and Christian Valla using an interactive UX Pin prototype. Zoom was used to facilitate a set of 4 tasks to test the changes to the wizard flow and participants were encouraged to talk aloud.

Liz Lantz acted as the primary facilitator and interviewer for all sessions. Notetakers included Tressa Furner, Josh Kim, and Megan Gayle. To mitigate confirmation bias, Megan Gayle and Josh Kim led this synthesis effort as they were uninvolved in the design of the wizard.

## Who we talked to

- Only 5 users could be tested in the study compared to the anticipated 6-8 due to an unforeseen facilitator withdrawal from the study. 
- 7 out of the 11 requested participant criteria were met
- There were not enough participants to provide confident recommendations. For more on sampling risks and potential solutions, [view the sample data and analysis document.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/how-to-apply-wizards/discovery/research/sample-data-analysis.md)

## Risks

### Technology Coverage
- Mobile was not tested which may have unveiled significant variance in behavior due to the sign-in alert covering the page to the fold e.g. participants may have not scrolled further down the page. Small touch targets within the wizard may have also posed challenges (one user struggled to select the right radio button on tablet).
- Screen reader and keyboard use was not tested which may have unveiled significant variance in navigational behavior as elements can be shown and hidden unexpectedly. 
- Zooming was not tested
- A tablet user existed, but the test was not designed for tablet viewports
- Low bandwidth was not tested

### Participants
- Due to variance in behavior between the 5 recruited participants, no recommendations can be made with confidence and should be treated as educated guesses in need of further validation.
- Although disability ratings were provided, categories of disabilities were not. Therefore findings related to any category of disability cannot be made confidently.
- For a more complete list of risks and potential solutions, [view the sample data and analysis document.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/how-to-apply-wizards/discovery/research/sample-data-analysis.md)

### Facilitation
- Talk out loud methodology may have caused participants to be more conscious about their actions and more likely to read through content. Consequently, research questions related to understanding information cannot be answered with confidence and are in need of unmoderated validation or other studies that can triangulate findings.
- As the prototype did not have all links mapped, some behavior was left unobserved which may have altered findings.
The facilitator of the study was also the designer of the prototype being tested. Liz rightly flagged this as a potential source of confirmation bias and recruited Megan and Josh to conduct synthesis in order to introduce practitioner triangulation.
- Participants were given “imagined” prompts to nudge them through the tasks when they exhibited unexpected behavior.
- Several leading questions were posed. The post-task question on preferred format (block content vs. the wizard) was consistently asked in a leading manner. Note: this is common in interviews for all researchers.
- Josh conducted transcription of 4 of 5 interviews and collected patterns under tasks for synthesis which may bias findings. To mitigate risk through practitioner triangulation, a group synthesis activity was conducted. 

## Research Questions

- Are people still able to understand the wizard outcome in the new, simplified, icon-free design?

- How easily do people understand where they're being routed to?

- Are people able to find the skip link?

- When would people want to use the skip link?

- How easily do people understand how to start over?

- In the education flow, do people get confused by being started on the 1990 form page from the How to apply page?

- How about when they're routed to a different form from the 1990?

- Can users get back to the wizard once they've navigated away from a form page?

- When do users want to go back to the wizard?

- Do people understand the wizard questions?

- Are any of the questions confusing or unclear?

- Are people confident they are applying for the right benefit after they take the wizard?

## Key Findings
1. 4/5 participants got help from an education counselor. Education counselors may play a significant role in navigating veterans through the education flow.
2. 2/5 participants did not notice the skip link and 4/5 participants did not notice the link to start over. Veterans were more interested in links that could provide them information relevant to them. 
3. Participants weren't aware updating education benefits would be done through a form. Only 1/5 participants was able to complete this task without clear guidance from the facilitator.
4. All participants understood when the wizard routed them elsewhere for the first time, but 2/5 became confused when routed to a different form the second time.
5. 2/5 participants were hesitant about losing the selections they filled into the wizard upon leaving and returning to it.
6. Majority of the barriers to task completion for the veterans were a result of mismatched content or not having enough information to make a choice.
7. All participants read eligibility information, but this may have been positively influenced by the nature of the moderated read out loud activity.
8. It is unclear from this study whether or not veterans will prefer a block of content type of page vs. the wizard. When asked, 2/5 participants said they would prefer a hybrid approach- but this should not be taken with confidence as users are bad at imagining what they want.
