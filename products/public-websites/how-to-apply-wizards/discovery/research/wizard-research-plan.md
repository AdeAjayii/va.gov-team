# Wizard Migration Research Study
Capturing some questions we can answer through future research studies

## Design / UX
- Are people still able to understand the significance of alerts without icons?
- How easily do people understand where they're being routed to?
- Do people have any usability issues when we're using the additional info component inside an alert?
- When would people want to use the skip link?
- Are people able to find the skip link?

## Content / IA
- User flows. How do people understand various entry points and ways of getting to the form?
- Can users get back to the wizard?
- When do users want to go back to the wizard?
- There may be other small, content PW website questions to tack on to this research (Peggy will check with Danielle / Peggy)

## Participants
- Veterans or beneficiaries who have applied for education benefits in the last 12 months, or are planning on applying in the next 6 months.
