# Sample Data and Analysis

## Risk Analysis

### Areas of Risk
- For the amount of tasks and devices needed in this study, the requested sample of 6-8 users and ultimately final sample of 5 users is not enough to provide confident recommendations. 
- Specifically, findings from this study cannot be confidently applied to any of the dimensions marked with a :heavy_exclamation_mark: below. 
- For dimensions that do not have a :heavy_exclamation_mark:, confidence can only be determined based on whether or not clear patterns in behavior emerge from the study between similar dimensions. Otherwise, if no clear patterns emerge, more testing will be required before providing confident recommendations. 
- No mobile testing was conducted in this study due to unforeseen constraints.
- It is uncertain what kinds of disabilities this study can confidently address due to a lack of information. 

### Potential Solutions
- Conduct tests with users on mobile and assistive technology to significantly improve confidence in results. More abbreviated studies can be conducted using deviant case sampling to account for more extreme use cases which in theory would address simpler use cases. e.g. testing specifically with only screen reader and keyboard users would improve usability for all users.
- As a secondary addition or alternative, interviewing educational councilors may serve as a relatively accurate and fast proxy for gaps in research.
- As a tertiary alternative, findings can be delivered as educated guesses provided risk is documented and understood. Ideally primary and secondary solutions would be backlogged for future sprints.
