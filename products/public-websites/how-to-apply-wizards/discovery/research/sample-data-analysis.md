# Sample Data and Analysis

## Risk Analysis

### Issues
- For the amount of tasks and devices needed in this study, the requested sample of 6-8 users and ultimately final sample of 5 users is not enough to provide confident recommendations. 
- Specifically, findings from this study cannot be confidently applied to any of the dimensions marked with a :heavy_exclamation_mark: below. 
- For dimensions that do not have a :heavy_exclamation_mark:, confidence can only be determined based on whether or not clear patterns in behavior emerge from the study.
- No mobile testing was conducted in this study due to unforeseen constraints.
- It is uncertain what kinds of disabilities this study can confidently address due to a lack of information. 

### Potential Solutions
- Testing with more users on mobile and assistive technology will significantly improve confidence in results.
- As a secondary addition or alternative, interviewing educational councilors may serve as a relatively accurate and fast proxy for gaps in research.
