## Use Cases/Business Logic for Wizards


## For all Wizards

1. Will feature a user function to "start over" the Wizard which manually clears the session data
2. 

## Education Wizard

### Rule:
The only time a user doesn't need to repeat the wizard is if they complete the wizard and it immediately sends them to a different form in that form "family".  
- Example:  User completes wizard on form 1990 and is directed to the 1990n, user does not see wizard...if user navigates away from 1990n intro page, they have to repeat the wizard when they return to it or to any other edu form.
