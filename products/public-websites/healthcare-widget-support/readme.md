As of June, 2022, the Public Websites team supports five Healthcare react widgets, which help Vets accomplish five top tasks using the correct EHR system for the VA system they're trying to interact with:
- [refill prescription](https://www.va.gov/health-care/refill-track-prescriptions/)
- [make appointment](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments)
