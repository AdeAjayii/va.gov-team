# Potential Research for Unauth
Cindy Merrill, Senior Researcher, Mar 2021
## Research Questions
### Overall
* Why do Veterans come to VA.gov? With what goals/tasks in mind?
* How do Veterans currently try to find what they’re looking for on VA.gov?
  * What have they looked for recently and how? 
    * Search and/or browse?
    * Where do they start typically? Google? Facebook?
  * Do they find what they need? If not, what were they looking for? 
* What are the biggest pain points?
* What are the most-asked questions at the VA call center? 
### Search
- Which of the multiple search boxes on VA.gov do Veterans use? (global site search in header, Resources and Support, Find a Form, Find a Location, Find Yellow Ribbon school)
  - What Veterans think about searching on VA.gov?
  - Are Veterans aware of any of the search tools besides Global search? (all the others are pretty new and haven’t really been advertised)
  - What feedback do Veterans have on the search tools? Too many? Confused about which to use, or do they only use one? If only one, which one?
  - What do analytics tell us? Are all of these search methods being used?
  - *My hypothesis: Veterans just want to find what they’re looking for, and don’t want to choose from multiple ways to search unless it helps them get better results.*
- Get feedback on usability of search--findability, usage, pain points
- Get feedback on usability of search results
### Resources & Support
- Do Veterans use this search interface? Check analytics data and ask Veterans
- Do Veterans use the browsing interface (below the search box)? Check analytics data
- What is the coverage of the browsing interface vs. the browsing topics on VA.gov?
- Get feedback on usability--findability, usage, mobile experience, pain points
- How do Veterans view this page or content? Its own site? Never seen before? Content same or different from VA.gov home page?
  - What do Veterans think about a "subscription or RSS feed" model where they could subscribe to content types and get notification when new content is added? 
### Benefit Hubs 
(focused on the following dropdown links under "VA Benefits and Health Care" at the top of va.gov: Health care, Disability, Education and training, Careers and employment, Pension, Housing assistance, Life insurance, Burials and memorials)
- Do Veterans use this? Check analytics data and ask Veterans
- How do Veterans use this? (get info and leave? stay and browse?)
- Get feedback on usability--findability, usage, pain points
### Find a Form
- Do Veterans use this? Check analytics data and ask Veterans
- Get feedback on usability--findability, usage, pain points
### Find Yellow Ribbon school
- Do Veterans use this? Check analytics data and ask Veterans
- Get feedback on usability--findability, usage, pain points
- Any confusion with the GI Bill Comparison Tool? Do Veterans know which to use when?
## Next Steps
- Check analytics data to compare usage across unauth products 
- Talk to people to learn what the biggest pain points are
  - Call centers (Chante Lantos-Swett)--ask re question topics/themes
    - Review resources provided, reach out for intro to call center contacts, get report VA.gov topics/q's
  - Meg Peters (IA lead)
  - Danielle and Beth (content leads)
- Gather the most important unauth user tasks from journey map & other sources
  - Talk to Meg Peters and Shawna + John re top tasks
  - Review reports from Jeff Barnes, Elissa Frankle Olinsky
- Determine what unauth research would be the most impactful in the near term
  - **How do Veterans navigate to find what they need on the VA.gov home page?** (i.e., search at top, browse dropdowns (top), 4 quadrants, topics below, CTAs below, links in footer (including Resources and support), google search)
  - **Test top tasks on the website** (Meg wants to get top tasks from analytics, research how well Veterans do these tasks, ask about their top tasks) 
  - (Include tasks that may involve Benefit hubs, Resources & support, Find a form, Find Yellow Ribbon school)
  - **Baseline research across new products that haven’t been tested**
  - Research on products that support the most important user tasks 
  - Research on detailed content questions from Beth and Danielle (after incremental changes are done; they'll put compile a list)
