# Unauth Portfolio Checklist

These are the building blocks which we are putting in place to foster consistency and collaboration across the unauth teams -- Public Website, Search and Decision Tools.

## Foundational

- [X] **[How We Work Principles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/public-websites/how-we-work)**-- outlining roles, expectations, standards, biweekly meetings for steady cadence, etc.  Our home page.
- [ ] **Team Charter & GH Document Repository** (e.g. [Search team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/vsa/teams/search-discovery)) - Along with the team charter, this is where you will find the team's roster, ceremonies schedule, key artifacts including details about product line scope and annual roadmap documents.
- [ ] **Product Folders** - For each product managed by a team, there should be a separate, intuitively labeled GH folder in the master [Product directory](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products).  And within each Product folder, there should be well organized sub-folders with key artifacts. A standard approach to this sub-folder taxonomy would be:
   - Discovery/Research
   - Design
   - Product Outline & Requirements
   - Meeting Notes & Decisions
   - Technical
   - Analytics
   - Post MVP Releases (with more sub-folders)

## Doing the Work

- [X] **Sprint Ceremonies** 
- [X] **Sprint Planning/Grooming Approach** For unauth, we will adopt [this approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/18941) to ensure meeting efficiency and reduce coginitive demand as the PO transitions from one team ceremony to the next.
- [ ] **Quarterly Planning Approach** TBD -- how do we want to articulate our three-month plan?
- [ ] **Annual Roadmapping Planning Approach**
