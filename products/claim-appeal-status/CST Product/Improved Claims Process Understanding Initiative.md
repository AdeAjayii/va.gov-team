# Executive Summary

This initiative aims to improve veterans' understanding of the claims process in the CST, helping them distinguish their responsibilities from those of the VA, and guide them effectively in evidence submission. By achieving these goals, we hope to enhance the claim processing efficiency and veterans' overall satisfaction with the CST.

# Problem Statement(s)

* Veterans often struggle to understand the roles and responsibilities of the VA and themselves at various stages of the claims process, leading to missed opportunities, redundant actions, or misaligned expectations.
* Veterans find it challenging to comprehend why specific evidence is requested and what constitutes strong evidence, leading to weak or delayed responses.
* The current representation of the claims process in the CST, being linear and overly simplified, misleads veterans about the actual flow of events, inducing frustration when the claim stagnates at a stage or moves backward.

# Desired Outcomes

* Veterans have a clear understanding of the claims process, their responsibilities, and the VA's responsibilities at each stage.
* Veterans can easily differentiate between their own tasks and those of the VA at each stage of the claims process.
* Veterans understand why specific evidence is requested and what constitutes strong evidence, leading to more timely and effective submissions.
* The CST provides a more accurate depiction of the claims process, better aligning veterans' expectations with the reality of claim progression.

# Audiences Served

Veterans with pending disability compensation claims.

# Assumptions

* Veterans want more detailed information about the claims process, their responsibilities, and the VA's responsibilities.
* Providing clearer information about the claims process will lead to more relevant and timely evidence submissions from veterans.
* Veterans are often confused by the claims process, particularly about their responsibilities and what is expected from them at each stage.
* Improving veterans' understanding of the claims process will lead to fewer unnecessary cycles in claim processing and a smoother overall experience.
* A more transparent and understandable claims process will improve veterans' satisfaction with the CST.

# Core Bet

Our core bet is that if we can improve veterans' understanding of the claims process, clearly differentiate the responsibilities between the veteran and the VA, and provide effective guidance on evidence submission, it will lead to more timely and compelling evidence submissions, fewer unnecessary cycles in claim processing, and improved satisfaction with the CST.

## How we will know if we are right (KPIs)

* **Veteran understanding of the claims process:** Measure the percentage of veterans who report a clear understanding of the claims process, their responsibilities, and the VA's responsibilities at each stage. This can be gauged through post-interaction surveys or user interviews.
* **Quality of submitted evidence:** Evaluate the quality of the submitted evidence based on a predefined rubric that considers relevance, completeness, and clarity. An increase in the average quality score would indicate that veterans are submitting more effective evidence.
* **Timeliness of evidence submissions:** Track the average time taken by veterans to respond to evidence requests. A decrease in response time may indicate that veterans understand the importance and requirements of the request.
* **Claim processing efficiency:** Measure the average number of cycles (i.e., movements back and forth between stages) in the claims process. A decrease in the number of cycles could indicate a smoother, more efficient process.
* **Veteran satisfaction with the CST:** Collect feedback and satisfaction ratings related to the claims process understanding. Higher ratings and positive feedback would indicate that the improvements are meeting veterans' needs.

## Open Questions

* How might we communicate the non-linearity of the claims process to veterans in a clear and digestible way that doesn't lead to increased frustration or confusion?
* How can we best present the distinction between a veteran's responsibilities and the VA's responsibilities at each stage of the claims process?
* What methods of communication (e.g., text, video, infographics) are most effective in conveying this information to veterans?
* How can we best solicit feedback from veterans to continuously improve our approach?
