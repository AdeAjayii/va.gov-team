## Post-launch Questions  
To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above.   
1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?  
2. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?  
3. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated?  
4. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
