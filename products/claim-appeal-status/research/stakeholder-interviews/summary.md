Summary CST stakeholder interviews, 27-28 July 2020

08/03/2020 By Christian Valla

Data from two initial stakeholders: Fred Somers and Paul Shute

The current CST has certain areas that create confusion for users:

-   Lack of detailed and precise information about the status of claims and appeals

-   A claim can go back and forth in the progress/timeline, and this is normal. But it can be frustrating for veterans and officers. A veteran might think this means that the progress of the claim is stalling. Better communication/explanation is needed here. 

-   Current CST is more aligned with the VA business process than user needs. VA uses a lot of industry/specialist jargon. Better communication with veterans is needed, using a common language. 

-   The VA website is not accurately describing the claim status. Quote: "I received a letter stating that my VSO has sent my appeal back to the BVA. But VA.gov states that the DAV still has my file. (...) Why isn't the VA website accurately describing my status? Can I get a straight answer from anyone including my VSO? It gets frustrating when a potential decision has been made but the Veteran has to play a guessing game that I compare with a raffle. Where is my file at and where am I in line?"

-   CST has the undersecretary's attention because a veteran called in about the long processing time. It is hard to create an accurate time estimate.

Reasons for delays and cycling back to previous steps:

-   Cycling back happens to ensure that all evidence (e.g. exams and medical evidence)  are present and accurate. Communicate this to the veteran. Or if the veteran can do something - communicate this. 

-   Missed evidence, missing examination, or expired examinations are the most common types of remands.

-   There are only about a dozen items/issues that are frequently resulting in cycling back. If the communication and processing of these are improved, the decision rate could be better, and the cycling back could potentially be reduced. 

-   Only 40% of claims go through to the decision cycle. 

-   86% of the time - is spent within the Gather evidence step (gathering documents from doctors, laymen paper, other info/docs from the veteran).

Challenges to the CST process:

-   Coordination between federal agencies, pulling records from DOD takes a lot of time. Maybe the veterans could provide these proactively? 

-   Unsolicited evidence/documents can slow down the process, as it can lead to another review round, and cycling back. We should guide veterans better, what is in their best interest to submit or not. 

-   VA, in general, in order to comply with legal matters, provides veterans with more information than necessary. This leads to an impersonal, complicated communication style. 

-   There are two different finish lines: for us, it is to get the claim to the board, but for the veteran, it is to get a decision from the Board.

-   We don't have any influence on how it takes for a case to get in front of a judge. 

-   Sometimes an exam or other documentation might become outdated in the waiting period.

What should CST accomplish, short and long-term? 

-   Short term: use all the information and findings we already have about the veterans to make tools better and more efficient. 

-   Think about mirroring aspects of the Manage a legacy VA appeal page for CST.

-   Long term: much more integrated information and actions, more self-service capabilities, two-way communication with adjudicators. Several layers of communication fitted to each veteran's preference: chat-bot, text messages, human interaction, embedded in the tool. CST should be more check status and upload documents. Include machine learning, robotics, automation. Provide a more personalized experience and possibility to connect with a call center, specialist, claim manager. Multiple tiers to engage with the VA.

Organizational goals with new CST: 

-   Reducing the number of calls to the call centers, efficiency gains, improved customer experience, and satisfaction. Build trust with veterans. 

-   Learning about the veteran's experience of the user experience. Digitally have them tell us about their needs and wants. Give veterans more ownership.

Concerns:

-   The biggest mistake would let the VA business process drive the decision for the development of the new tool. It is important here to use a Human-Centered Design process (HCD).  

-   Stay on the side of the user/veteran, not the agency!

-   How to integrate all types (federal, private, other) of records? 

-   More clarity and communication on who is doing what.

-   Veterans need to know more about the process: what specific appeal are we talking about, where is this specific appeal in the process, who is working on it now, what are the steps, who are the actors.

What services handle claim status data?

-   VBMS, Corporate Database (the basics).

-   For appeal:  We use Legacy programs (Waycall??) and WBMS.

-   HLR only uses Caseflow for intake. 

-   With a legacy appeal - Caseflow would not have the best info.

-   The Board uses Caseflow (and Waycall??) to manage cases on their side.

Other people or teams we should talk to:

-   Departments that benefits from an improved CST: Benefits Assistance Service, National Call Center, Pension and compensation, Office of Strategic Engagement, Office of field operations, the Pension and fiduciary service, (and perhaps VSO's).

-   Stay in touch with Paul Shute, Allison Zmetra, Andrew Gray.

Project success:

-   Reduce the number of inquiries, including phone calls. 

-   Provide more and more accurate and relevant info, so veterans have fewer unanswered questions. 

-   Do not send out generic or vague messages/information.

-   Gain a better understanding of updates, and improve these. We have data, present data in more useful ways. 

-   The metrics of satisfaction improves, error rates drop, decision cycle metrics improve.

-   KPI: The veteran decision cycle is bumped up to 60% (50% improvement).
