Research Plan Claim Status Tool:  Usability study + Co-design session
=====================================================================

VSA B&M1 Team, BDD, Christian Valla, June 2020

Background
----------

This is part 2 of 3 for the Claim Status Tool research process.

-Part 1 (complete) was a Comparative analysis and a Previous Research review.

You can access this research [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/April-2020-dicovery-concept-usability): 

-Part 2 (this document) will consist of the following research elements (executed in the same session):

1.  Short qualitative interview with veterans about their experience with claims and the claims status tool

2.  Collaborative Design Sessions with veterans

3.  Time allowing, a quick usability test of the current Claim Status Tool 

It makes sense to do research on the current Claim status tool for several reasons:

1.  The current Claim status tool has been largely untouched for 3 years and is due for a review.

2.  The Claim status tool is by far the most used page on VA.gov. It is not uncommon for veterans to check their claims or appeals multiple times per week. 

3.  The VA call center gets by far, the most calls about the Claim status pages. 

This presents a great opportunity for creating a good user experience for a large group of veterans that are using this tool frequently. And it presents a possibility to reduce the number of calls to the VA about the claim status tool. 

10 Veterans that have at least submitted one claim with the VA, will be invited for a 60 min session.

Approximately 15 min will be used for an intro and an interview, 30-35 min for the co-design session, and 5-10 min will be used for a short usability test.

Goals
-----

-   To understand the user experience of the current Claim status tool. What are the pain points and usability issues? What are the limitations of the current tool? 

-   What improvements would users like to see? What wants and needs do users have for such a tool? 

-   What are the common use cases? What possible use cases are not served by the current tool? How can the tool be expanded? 

-   How would veterans design a new Claim status tool? Blue sky approach. What additional capabilities would they like to see in such a tool? If this was a one-stop-shop for checking the status of all their claims and appeals, what actions would veterans like to be able to take within the tool? If anything was possible in such a tool, how would it look?

Method
------

We will conduct a short qualitative interview, a collaborative design session, and, time permitting, a short usability test, with 10 veterans (that have at least submitted one claim). 

We will be conducting remote, moderated usability studies, using Zoom to conduct these sessions.

We will show Veterans our screen and show them the Claim status tool (either in staging or use an Invision mockup), and ask a couple of questions. We will then share a Mural board with them and lead them through a collaborative design session, where we are sketching their comments into Mural.

Participants and Recruitment
----------------------------

We would like to interview 10 participants.

-   In order to get 10 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 15 participants total, with the expectation that there will be a max of 7 no-shows.

-   For the participants Perigeon recruits:

-   All Participants must be veterans that have submitted at least one benefits claim with the VA, within the last 2 years.

-   Ensure variation in age, gender, location, and tech-savviness.

-   Participants must be able to describe to the researcher what they are trying to accomplish, what they are experiencing, and what they are thinking as they move through the tasks given to them.

-   They must be able to perform a collaborative design session. That is: be able to vocalize ideas (about what they would like to be able to do in such a tool, features they want, functions they want) about a new claim status tool to the researcher.  

-   They must be able to use Zoom, use the chat function, share their screen through Zoom, see the researchers screen clearly, and navigate various websites.

-   They must be on a desktop computer or a laptop. Phones or iPads etc. will not work.

Research questions
------------------

#### For the usability test

-   What are the current pain points and usability issues? 

-   What are confusing, unclear in the current tool?

-   What is most confusing and what is most helpful in the tool?

-   Do participants feel that they have all the information they need as they are using this tool?

-   Do participants have any questions or concerns about the tool? 

-   What do participants typically do within the tool? 

-   Most frequent use cases

-   Edge use cases

-   Additional uses cases they would like to be able to perform in the tool 

#### For the collaborative design session

-   What are the most important actions users want to perform in the tool? 

-   How do they expect to approach these actions?

-   What are the most important pieces of information users want to look up in the tool? 

-   How do they expect to see this information presented? 

-   Where would they expect to find this tool?

-   How would they prefer to enter such a tool?
