##Research Summary for Claim status tool research, part 2 (June 25-29, 2020)  

Prepared by UX Research lead: Christian Valla, BAM 1 team                          
This is a high-level summary of 12 research sessions.

#### Findings from the usability tests and the co-design sessions

Overall findings:

What participants mention most often, are not usability issues and pain points in the Claim status tool itself, but lack of updates, lack of detailed info, and long processing time:   

-   Lack of detailed information about progress and steps

-   Lack of timelines and more accurate time estimations

-   Lack of relevant and efficient updates, and adequate communication about the progress

-   Long processing time (of claims)

Detailed findings:

1.  Participants that have used the tool (8 out of 12) find the Claim status tool to be relatively easy to use and straightforward, with few issues. 

2.  They don't have specific usability issues within the Status tab or the Files tab. They like the steps, but find that vital info is missing. In Step 3 (Evidence gathering, review, and decision), they want more detailed info on progress and detailed time estimations.   

3.  They also want to know if there are issues with the claim, and/or actions they need to take, in order for the claim/appeal to proceed. 

Highest prioritized features in a new tool:

Next steps: 

One of the reasons the Claim Status Tool was picked as a tool that would be valuable to update/improve, is that it is the absolute number one topic within [the VA call center.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/April-2020-dicovery-concept-usability/Quantitative%20Analysis%20-%20Claims%20and%20Appeals%20Status%20Tool.pdf) 

We will do an analysis of the specific content/topics within these calls. With this info and the info coming out of the research presented above, we will come with a set of specific recommendations for upcoming research and design for the Claim Status Tool.
