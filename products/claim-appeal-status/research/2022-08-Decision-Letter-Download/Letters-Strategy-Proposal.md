# Letters Strategy Proposal
## Background
During our [research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-08-Decision-Letter-Download/research-findings.md) for the Decision Letter Download feature, Benefits Team 1 tested compared our new Claim Letters feature agains the existing Letters page for downloading benefit letters. 

We were initially considering adding the new [Claim Letters page](https://www.sketch.com/s/8b025901-295d-4929-95cc-8dbeb28454b3/p/CAA1846C-79ED-4BDB-94B9-BA0EBE74EC5B/canvas) to the existing [Letters page](https://www.va.gov/records/download-va-letters/). During our testing, we discovered some potential areas of confusion that we think require further research before determining how these various "letters" integrate in the VA.gov UI. As a result of this, we decided to intially launch the Claim Letters page within the Claim Status Tool. We recommend a sitewide audit and strategy for letters, that accounts for everything that might be reasonably deemed a "letter." As new types of letters come online, it will be critical for the site to have a holistic strategy for this type of content that is easily understood and accessible to Veterans. 

## Research findings
From our limited initial research, we discovered that the term "letters" in the UI did cause some confusion for Veterans. Specifically, when we included both the Benefit Letters and Claim Letters entrypoints on the same page, 4/10 participants made the wrong choice in trying to get to their decision letters. We think this demonstrates some confusion in the use of the term "letter." ![dp1 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95102058/196748601-a407c49e-e6b0-4894-8d09-3da4d98b1c83.png)

We did find, however, that Veterans understood the different use cases for downloading benefit letters vs. downloading claim letters. We asked Veterans to describe the difference in their own words. Below are a few examples of what they said: 

> “(Claim letters) is for getting access to an archived copy of a claim letter that I’ve actually received in the mail.” - P8

> “With (benefit letters) you have proof that you’re a Veteran and what benefits you have access to.” - P17

> “(Claim letters) was a letter from the VA to me, whereas (benefit letters) is a letter the website is generating that supports me.” - P19
