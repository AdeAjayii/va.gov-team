This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings


**Core task of accessing Decision Letters via the VA.gov homepage and Claim Status Tool was very succesfful**

- All participants were able to navigate from the VA.gov homepage to the Claim letters page and the decision letter with minimal confusion or usability issues
- A few participants got hung up on the Claim Status Tool detail page, although it was hard to assess how big of an issue this was for them given the prototype's limited functionality
- One participant in particular felt that it required "too many steps" to get to the decision letter, validating a hypothesis we had that we can look to improve if we are able to overcome technical constraints.
