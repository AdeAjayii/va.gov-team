# (WIP) Research Plan for Benefits Team 1: Initial Decision Research

## Background

From the perspective of CST, we want to understand the experience veterans have with requests to provide additional evidence and also experience getting requests to go to C&P exams.

We want to find opportunities to help veterans provide better evidence in support of their claim and earlier. And also, we want veterans to show up to their C&P exams with the right expectations.

Secondary to that, getting an understanding of what veterans really want to know to stay informed as their claim goes through the initial decision process.

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following OCTO Objectives: 

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This work touches on various aspects of the Veteran Journey. Whenever a Veteran is applying for disability compensation benefits, this feature would be relevant. For many Veterans, this can happen at any point along their life journey. 

## Research Goals	
With this research, we are hoping to speak with Veterans who have filed disability compensation claims or decision reviews. We are hoping to identify pain points in that experience, especially as it relates steps they need to take while the claim is being processed. These steps will be initiated from CST, and so we hope to find ways that we might improve CST to improve this user experience. 


### Outcome
We will use this study to get some foundational qualitative data to strengthen our understanding of the initial decision review process from the Veteran perspective. We aim to identify pain points in that process, especially those related to the Claim Status Tool, that our team can can solve for. The scope of the research will be broad, but we will be looking specifically for feedback about CST, evidence submission, and C&P exams. We are hoping to improve CST in ways that will reduce the overall time that initial decisions take.

### Research questions
Part 1: Warm up
- Have you used VA.gov before? What do you typically use it for?  
- How long have you been using VA.gov?
- Do you interact with the VA in other ways (in person, on the phone)?

Part 2: Initial Decision
- Have you used VA.gov to file a disability compensation claim (526-EZ)?
- How many disability compensation claims have you filed? When did they start, when did they end?
- Have those claims been resolved, or are they still in progress?
- On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate the process of filing that claim? Why?
- What were the main challenges in filing the claim?
- Was there anything that went well, or better than you expected?

Status
- Did you feel like you understood what was happening while your claim was being reviewed?
- What information would have been useful to you to help you better understand what was going on with your claim? 

Evidence
- How did you know what evidence to provide for the claim?
- Did you provide all your evidence up front, or did you add evidence along the way while the claim was being reviewed?

Exams
- Did you do a C&P exam as part of the claim process? How was that? 
- How did you know that you had to do a C&P exam? 
- How long did that process take, from when you found out about the exam to when you completed it? 

### Hypothesis

- There are certain user actions that add time to the claims process, and we can reduce the overall time it takes for a claim to be submitted and reviewed by improving CST in a way that expedites these user actions.
- There are aspects of the evidence submission process that are confusing and/or laborious, and that this is adds to the overall time it takes for a claim to be filed and processed. 
- There are aspects of the C&P exam that are confusing and/or laborious, particularly that veterans are not informed about C&P effectively, and that this adds to the overall time it takes for claims to be filed and processed. 

## Methodology	

**Semi-structured interviews** 
The interviewer will ask the Veterans a series of questions with the goal of learning more about their decision review experience and the pain points they encountered. The goal of this is generative – to try and elecit problems that the team can solve with subsequent design ideation.


### Location
Remote on Zoom
