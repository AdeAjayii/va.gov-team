# (WIP) Research Plan for Benefits Team 1: Initial Decision Research

## Background

From the perspective of CST, we want to understand the experience veterans have with requests to provide additional evidence and also experience getting requests to go to C&P exams.

We want to find opportunities to help veterans provide better evidence in support of their claim and earlier. And also, we want veterans to show up to their C&P exams with the right expectations.

Secondary to that, getting an understanding of what veterans really want to know to stay informed as their claim goes through the initial decision process.

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following OCTO Objectives: 

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This work touches on various aspects of the Veteran Journey. Whenever a Veteran is applying for disability compensation benefits, this feature would be relevant. For many Veterans, this can happen at any point along their life journey. 

## Research Goals	
With this research, we are hoping to speak with Veterans who have filed disability compensation claims or decision reviews. We are hoping to identify pain points in that experience, especially as it relates steps they need to take while the claim is being processed. These steps will be initiated from CST, and so we hope to find ways that we might improve CST to improve this user experience. 


### Outcome
We will use this study to get some foundational qualitative data to strengthen our understanding of the initial decision review process from the Veteran perspective. We aim to identify pain points in that process, especially those related to the Claim Status Tool, that our team can can solve for. The scope of the research will be broad, but we will be looking specifically for feedback about CST, evidence submission, and C&P exams. We are hoping to improve CST in ways that will reduce the overall time that initial decisions take.

### Research questions
Part 1: General questions
- Did you use VA.gov to file your (decision review option)?
- What were your main reasons for filing the (decision review option)?
- Did you consult a third party (Veteran rep, lawyer) when filing your initial claim? Did you consult a third party when filing a (decision review option)?
- On a scale of 1-5, how would you rate your experience submitting a (decision review option)?
- What were your biggest challenges with the process? 
- Was there anything about the process that worked particularly well?
- How did you feel about the end result (or how do you feel so far, if it’s underway)?

- [Show [existing decision review info](https://www.va.gov/resources/choosing-a-decision-review-option/) to ppt.] Were you aware of this page? Did you use it as a resource when pursuing your decision review option? Given your experience, do you think you would use a page like this if you were to pursue a decision review option in the future?

Part 2: Concept prototype

**Important note:** This concept prototype used in this study is purely conceptual, meant to assess the value of a self-service experience for decision review options. Before proceeding with implementation of any of these designs, we will take them through a full platform review process.  

- Let’s say you just received a decision, but you’re unhappy with the result. What would you do?
- [Show user [concept prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/a54a9f34-e844-4d75-a458-502fe4e643e6/p/3D7AE506-1582-440A-807F-56656F277DB9/canvas)] On a scale of 1-5, how helpful is this? 
- Does this information help you decide which decision review option is right for you?
- What would you do next?
- What would you expect to happen if you filed a (decision review option) in this way? 
- Is there anything else you would do at this point, either on VA.gov or elsewhere?


### Hypothesis

- We have a hunch that a fully self-service digital experience will not satisfy all use cases for Veterans who are pursuing decision review options. We are hoping to get clarity around which use cases are best for self-service digital, and which require the support of a VSO. 
- We suspect that Veterans might not fully trust the VA to appoint a representative for them. Given suspicions we've seen in data and anecdotally, Veterans might feel as though the VA is not giving them the "best" representation and they might express a desire to seek out their own.
- We have a hypothesis that self-service works well for simplified or automated use cases. In this scenario, the simplified PACT Act experience enabled via automation might be the use case that works best in a digital self-service environment.

## Methodology	

**Semi-structured interviews** 
The interviewer will ask the Veterans a series of questions with the goal of learning more about their decision review experience and the pain points they encountered. The goal of this is generative – to try and elecit problems that the team can solve with subsequent design ideation.


### Location
Remote on Zoom

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research is Veterans who have gone through a decision review, or are in the process of going through a decision review. We would like to recruit (out of 40 total): 

- 20 ppts who have submitted a Supplemental Claim
- 10 ppts who have submitted a Higher Level Review
- 10 ppts who have submitted a Notice of Disagreement

### Recruitment criteria
We would like to recruit 40 Veterans with the goal of successfully completing at least 20 sessions. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

We are primarily looking for Veterans who have experience with the decision review process for disability compensation claims. Participants must be able to speak to their process, so ideally it has happened in the last ~5 years, or they are curently in the process of a decision review.

> Question for recruits: "Have you ever submitted either a Supplemental Claim (Form 20-0995), a Higher Level Review (Form 20-0996) , or a Notice of Disagreement (Form 10182)?"

We would like to recruit at least 20 Veterans who worked with a Veteran Service Organization (VSO) in pursuing their decision review. 

We would like representation from the following underrepresented groups: 

- 10 Primarily mobile users
- 10 Veterans in a rural area
- 10 Veterans without a degree

## Timeline
Jan 23 – Feb 3

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email: rocio@coforma.io
* Date and time of pilot session: Thu, Jan 19

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: Jan 23 - Feb 3

### Length of sessions
- 1 hour sessions
- 30 minute buffer time between sessions 
- Maximum 4 sessions per day

### Availability
8 AM – 6 PM EST
