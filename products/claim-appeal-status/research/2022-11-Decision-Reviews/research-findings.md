## Research Goals
With this research, we are hoping to speak with Veterans who have engaged in a decision review. We want to learn more about the pain points in this user journey.

We are also curious to find out more about which of these journeys can be fully self-service, given the complexity and high stakes nature of these reviews. We want to understand more about the Veteran experience working with VSOs and third party legal reps, so that we can create an experience that guides Veterans to either self-service or VSO-supported options in the optimal way.


## Methodology 

We scheduled 40 remote Zoom sessions with Veterans. In the end, we successfully completed [x] sessions.

This was broad-based discovery research intended to identify pain points in the Veteran claims and appeals process. We also got some feedback on a concept prototype intended to help Veterans connect with VSOs on VA.gov.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_We have a hunch that a fully self-service digital experience will not satisfy all use cases for Veterans who are pursuing decision review options. We are hoping to get clarity around which use cases are best for self-service digital, and which require the support of a VSO._ 

**True.** It is clear there is no one-size-fits-all approach to helping Veterans file disability compensation claims and decision reviews. We heard from a number of Veterans who said VSOs were crucial to their ability to complete this process, but we also heard from Veterans who were optimistic about the VA.gov experience. Depending on a variety of factors including (but not limited to) age, the amount of free time they have, the strength of their connection to a Veteran network, and their geographic location, a self-service VA.gov process may or may not be sufficient to meet their needs. 

_We suspect that Veterans might not fully trust the VA to appoint a representative for them. Given suspicions we've seen in data and anecdotally, Veterans might feel as though the VA is not giving them the "best" representation and they might express a desire to seek out their own._

**False.** Veterans didn't mention being suspicious of finding a representative through the VA. Many of the Veterans we showed our "Connect with a representative" prototype to thought it was a positive thing and something they would use to connect with a VSO. Some participants in fact found a good VSO through the VA. 

_We have a hypothesis that self-service works well for simplified or automated use cases. In this scenario, the simplified PACT Act experience enabled via automation might be the use case that works best in a digital self-service environment._

**Maybe.** This needs further research to verify. We didn't test these use cases explicitly in this study. We did confirm that a major pain point of filing claims and appeals is the gathering and submission of supporting evidence. "Presumptive" cases like those enabled by the PACT Act would likely help make the self-service use case more appealing for these types of claims, but it needs further research.


## Key Findings

1. Many Veterans we spoke to found VSOs to be crucial in getting to a satisfactory claim decision.

2. It's clear that not VSOs are equal in quality, and a bad VSO can be detrimental to a Veteran's experience. 

3. Veterans responded positively to the idea of connecting with a VSO or other representative via the website. 

4. The most common pain point we heard in filing claims or decision reviews is knowing what documentation/evidence you will need and being able to track it down. This is often why Veterans turn to VSOs or even lawyers for guidance.

5. Many Veterans imagined an ideal experience that could be thought of as "assisted self-service." They wanted to be able to complete the process themselves on VA.gov, but also wanted expert help easily available in case they got stuck.


## Details of Findings 


### We spoke to many Veterans who found VSOs to be crucial in getting a satisfactory claim decision.

Labels: BNFT: Disability, PRDT: Decision Reviews, PRDT: Benefit Hubs, SPG: Vets at VSOs

Many of the Veterans we talked to had positive things to say about their experience working with a Veteran Service Organization (VSO). Some expressed that they didn't believe they would have been able to get benefits at all without the help of a VSO. There are many types of VSOs, but some of the ones we commonly heard about were Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) and Disabled American Veterans (DAV).    

> "Doing it on my own, I don't know how I would have gotten through all that." - P7

> "You're always wise to take counsel and go with people who do this for a living." - P9

> "Without a VSO, I wouldn't have the compensation that I have." - P34


### It's clear that VSOs vary in quality, and a bad VSO can be detrimental to a Veteran's experience.

Labels: BNFT: Disability, PRDT: Decision Reviews, PRDT: Benefit Hubs, SPG: Vets at VSOs 

We talked to many Veterans who had gone to several different VSOs before finding one that worked for them. A smaller number of Veterans gave up on VSOs after a bad experience, and decided to go it alone or hire a lawyer specializing in VA claims to help them. Common issues with VSOs were a perceived lack of interest in the Veteran, an overly pessimistic attitude towards claims, and severe backlogs that led to very long wait times.

> "The VSOs are overwhelmed, especially with the PCT Act, these guys just get swamped." - P3

> P6: Tried to connect with VSO and there was a huge backlog and couldn't connect from 1996-2011. He even worked at a VSO (VFW) but was still unable to get help filing a claim due to the backlog. 

> "The state VSOs we have here are hit and miss." - P12

> "Some (VSOs) are good, some are bad." - P19

> "When I first went to the VSO in 2015, he had me fill the form for what the request was about, but he didn't request medical records." - P30


### Veterans responded positively to the idea of connecting with a VSO or other representative via the website. 

Labels: BNFT: Disability, PRDT: Decision Reviews, PRDT: Benefit Hubs, SPG: Vets at VSOs 

Our concept prototype contained link to a page that allowed Veterans to see their current VSO reps and connect with other VSO reps. If anything, participants wanted this option to be even more prominent and readily available.

> "I would have VSO info at the top of the page where they see that first." - P5 

> "I would try to get an accredited person before i did anything so I have a better understanding of the proces." - P7

> "You have connect with a rep right here. Excellent service." - P20

> P29: Would call someone for help to verify she was doing right thing. She was happy to see that option on the page.


### The most common pain point we heard in filing claims or decision reviews is knowing what documentation/evidence you will need and being able to track it down. This is often why Veterans turn to VSOs or even lawyers for guidance.

Labels: BNFT: Disability, PRDT: Decision Reviews, PRDT: Benefit Hubs, SPG: Vets at VSOs 

Evidence gathering consistently emerged as a major pain point in the claims and decision review filing process, and a major benefit of getting help from a VSO. 

> "If these folks are going to file on their own, they need details explaining the type of records they need. It doesn't tell you enough about the process. It leads you to believe "fill out this form, and you're good to go." - P5

> "I'm tired of justifying this, when all the VRO has to do is read (the active duty medical records). You want a detailed summary? do it yourself." - P6

> "I had to reach out ot the VA to get my medical records, and I had got to various doctors to get my records as well. It's so much hassle, because you have to do so much running to get everything together." - P23

### Some Veterans imagined an ideal experience that could be thought of as "assisted self-service." They wanted to be able to complete the process themselves on VA.gov, but also wanted expert help easily available in case they got stuck. 

Labels: BNFT: Disability, PRDT: Decision Reviews, PRDT: Benefit Hubs, SPG: Vets at VSOs 

Veterans liked that the self-service option was available, but expressed hesitancy to complete a claim or decision review online without getting any help from an expert third party.

> "(Would recommend to fellow Veteran): If youâ€™re having problems, give someone a call and talk to them." - P16

> "I would recommend doing both. I think you can do it yourself. but there are some things. It's like doing your taxes. You can do it yourself, but you can also have some assistance." - P24

> "Kinda torn (about self-service vs. VSO). I'd like to be able to do both...help with a rep and have access to complete it myself." - P31


## Additional Insights
