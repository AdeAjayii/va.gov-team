## Research Goals
With this research we were hoping to validate the usability of our design concepts for "Track 1" Evidence Submission work. "Track 1" is a set of near-term, concrete user experience and accessibility updates we want to make to CST.

See the [full Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2023-05-Evidence-Submission/research-plan.md) for more details.


## Research Questions

* Does this new design make it easier for Veterans to understand when they have an evidence submission request in CST? Are they better able to understand exactly what that request is and how to act on it?
* Does including the claim ID in the claim card make it easier for Veterans to distinguish between different claims in CST?
* Do Veterans respond positively to the new layout of the Claim Details page, with separate sections dedicated to Veteran actions and VA actions?
* Do Veterans respond positively to other UX improvements in this version of CST?
  

## Methodology 

Remote usability testing sessions with Veteran participants.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

*1. The new design will help Veterans distinguish between different claims in CST.*

**MAYBE TRUE**. Participants didn't appear to have any problems distinguishing between claims in CST. There wasn't any conclusive evidence,     however, that the new design was responsible, since we didn't compare the new design directly to the current design as a control. We also didn't see Claim IDs impact this in any significant way, as we were expecting they might. In sum, users had no trouble distinguishing between the two claims in the prototype, but it wasn't clear exactly why. 

*2. Veterans will prefer the new Status page to the old Status page overall.*

**TRUE**. Almost all participants conclusively stated that they preferred the new design to the current design. Participants cited the visual design and specifcity of detail as the primary reasons why they preferred it. 


*3. The new design will give Veterans a strong understanding of what is happening with their claim at any given time.*

**TRUE**. 9/10 participants expressed a clear understanding of the Status page. In response to the question "How much would you say you understand what's going on with this claim on a scale of 1-5?" 7/10 participants responded with a 5/5. Two othe participants did not give a number but said that they clearly understood.

*4. The new design will help Veterans distinguish between requests for them that they need to act on and requests for third parties that they don't need to act on.*

WIP

*5. The new design will make it easy for Veterans to see requests for evidence submission and understand what those requests are.*

WIP

*6. The new design will make it clear to Veterans whether or not they need to take any action to advance their claim.*
