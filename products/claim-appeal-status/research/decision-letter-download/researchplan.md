# [WIP] Research Plan for Decision Letter Download 

Skyler Schain · Designer/Researcher

August 2022

## Background
Multiple research study findings suggest that the ability to download decision letters is a feature many veterans would like included in the Claim Status Tool. Currently, veterans need to wait for their decision letters to arrive via physical mail and, if they lose them, need to request one by reaching out to a call center representative or through other online channels with transaction costs that diminish their experience.
Veterans often need to provide copies of their decision letters to a representative to pursue disagreement pathways related to the decision. In addition, some benefits provided by third-parties require a decision letter as proof of the veterans’ disability status.

### OCTO Objectives 

This feature will most directly help the following OCTO objectives: 
- **Increase the usage and throughput of VA services.** 
  - If Veterans are able to access their decision letters directly from VA.gov, we hypothesize that usage of VA.gov will increase
- **Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome**
  - By not having to wait for physical mail to arrive, we hypothesize Veterans will be informed of outcomes quicker

### Veteran Journey
These events fall mainly in the "Taking Care of Myself" portion of the Veteran Journey. 

## Research Goals	
For this research, we would like to test the effectiveness of the MVF (Minimum Viable Feature) design solution for Decision Letter Download. We would like to ensure that the feature as designed is usable and accessible.

### Outcome
Based on what we find, we hope to feel confident in moving forward to the development phase of Decision Letter Download. If we find major issues with the proposed design, we will iterate on the solution to fix what we've identified. 

### Research questions
– Understand more about the decision letter user journey
– Assess whether the design proposal is effective for solving the user problem (i.e. needing access to the digital decision letter)
– Assess the accessibility of the proposed solution

### Hypothesis
We know that Veterans anxiously await their decision letters, and that the current Claim Status Tool does not do a good job of informing them of decisions. They currently have to wait for physical mail to arrive before they know their claim decision. During the study, we hope to see participants demonstrate a clear understanding of why we're building this feature, the purpose it serves, and how to interact with it successfully. 

## Method	
Usability testing

### Location
Remote via Zoom

## Recruitment	

Working with Perigean to recruit Veteran participants for remote moderated study.

### Recruitment approach
Veterans

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email: 
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: September 2022

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
