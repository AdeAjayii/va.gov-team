# Claims Status Tool - Claims Business Process

The purpose of this document is to understand:

1. What the general statuses are for each claim going through the claims process,
2. What the business process entails from a personnel perspective (i.e. who handles the claim at these particular phases in the process and what are their duties/roles?)
3. What some of the challenges are within the process that can delay claim processing
3. How long each phase typically takes to complete

We are researching this so we can look into each phase and address the commonly heard issue from veterans that the process is ambiguous and the statuses are either unclear or do not give them the depth of information they desire.

Currently, we know there are 5 phases that each claim goes through within the CST - they are as follows:

1. Claim received
2. Initial review
3. Evidence gathering, review and decision
4. Preparation for notification
5. Complete

## Phase 1: Claim Received

What the user sees from their account: "Thank you. VA received your claim" 

**Business process notes**

- Claim received begins when the claim is successfully placed under end product control.

Questions for this phase:

1. How long does this typically take?
2. Does this mean that it's simply created in the system?
3. How long does it typically stay in this phase?
4. What happens here? What people in the process get a hold of this information?
5. What system does it go into whereby actual people have access to it (the user facing system)?
6. How does it show up? Is it a generated PDF?


## Phase 2: Initial review

What the user sees from their account: "Your claim has been assigned to a reviewer who is determining if additional information is needed."

**Business process notes**

- Initial Review begins when National Work Queue (NWQ) routes the case to an adjudicator for review. This typically occurs the night after the claim is established.

Questions for this phase:

1. How long does it typically stay in this phase?
2. Does this mean that it's simply handed over? Or are there more activities in this phase?
3. Are there sequenced activities that happen in the initial review (i.e. we have to send it over to this dept, etc)?
4. Does the VA ever request more documentation from the Veteran at this stage?


## Phase 3: Evidence gathering, review and decision

What the user sees from their account: "If we need more information, we’ll request it from you, health care providers, governmental agencies, or others. Once we have all the information we need, we’ll review it and send your claim to the rating specialist for a decision."

**Business process notes**

- Evidence gathering, review, and decision represent two distinct claim lifecycles (evidence gathering and decision). Evidence gathering begins once the first evidence gathering activity is triggered (exam being requested, letter sent to Veteran requesting additional information, request to other Federal agencies including DoD for records, etc.) Once all evidence is gathered and the claim is determined to be ready for a decision, the claim status is updated either by a user-driven update to the claim status or a system-driven update to  the claim status based on all evidence gathering tasks being completed or closed.

Questions for this phase:

1. What is the range of time it might be in this phase (i.e. one day to several months)?
2. Can we break this down into 'evidence gathering & review' and 'decision'?
3. What are some of the ways the Veteran is made aware of documentation they might need to supply?
4. What are the most common things that hinder or slow down this process?
5. What are the most common things that Veterans do not supply at this point (that are crucial to the claims process)?
6. What are the most common internal slowdowns that occur at this stage?


## Phase 4: Preparation for notification

What the user sees from their account: "We are preparing your claim decision packet to be mailed."

**Business process notes**

- Preparation for notification begins when the rating decision has been completed and the claim moves from ready for decision status to rating decision complete.

Questions for this phase:

1. How long does it typically stay in this phase?
2. What systems are 'talked to' when the rating decision has been completed (what systems get this info)? 
3. What business lines are engaged in order to get this info put together?
4. Is this the stage where the packet is assembled for mailing?

## Phase 5: Complete

What the user sees from their account: "A decision packet has been mailed to you. Typically, decision notices are received within 10 days, but this is dependent upon U.S. Postal Service timeframes.

Payments

If you are entitled to back payment (based on an effective date), you can expect to receive payment within 1 month of your claim’s decision date."

**Business process notes**

- Complete begins once the claim is authorized and the end product is closed

Questions for this phase:

1. How long does it stay in this phase? (for example, how long until it has been 'closed'?)
2. How is the Veteran notified that their packet is in the mail?
3. Is there any way they can check the outcome of their claim decision before the packet arrives?


### Other Considerations

1. We understand there is a step in the code where a user is notified if the claim has gone back to the previous phase for review. When does that happen, and what can the user do about it?
2. There is a "we don't know the status of your claim" message in the code. When and why does this occur? What info might we be able to provide in this scenario?


### Next Steps

We plan on meeting with VBA and chatting with a few adjudicators to understand the business process and to answer some of these questions.
