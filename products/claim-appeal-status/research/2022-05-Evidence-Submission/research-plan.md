# Research Plan: Evidence Submission Usability Testing (WIP)

Benefits Team 1 · June 2023

## Background
In our research on [Decision Reviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2022-11-Decision-Reviews/research-findings.md) and [Initial Decisions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/claim-appeal-status/research/2023-03-Initial-Decisions-CST/research-findings.md) we identified a number of issues with the Claim Status Tool user experience. One of the main pain points relates to evidence submission: Veterans don't have a good understanding of what type of evidence to submit, and once the claim is in progress they are anxious about whether there is anything they need to do, or any additional materials they need to provide, to improve the likelihood of a favorable outcome. 

With this set of design changes to CST, we hope to make it clearer to Veterans what actions – if any – they need to take to support their claim. We also hope to improve the experience overall, leading to a CST that is more accessible, easier to understand, and leaves Veterans feeling more secure about the status of their claim. 

### OCTO Priorities 

This work supports the following [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md):
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran Journey
This work supports a Veteran whenever they are filing a disability compensation claim, which could occur across a wide swath of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf), ranging all the way from "Getting out" to "Aging." 

## Research Goals	
- Assess the usability of these CST design proposals for Veterans, including Veterans with specific accessibility needs
- Uncover any additional ideas we should pursue to improve the evidence submission experience for Veterans in CST. 

### Outcome
With this research we hope to validate the usability of our design concepts for "Track 1" Evidence Submission work. "Track 1" is a set of near-term, concrete user experience and accessibility updates we want to make to CST. "Track 2" work for CST will require more validation through concept testing before we refine the designs.

### Research questions
- Does this new design make it easier for Veterans to understand when they have a request to take action on a claim in CST? Are they better able to understand exactly what that request is and how to act on it? 
- Do Veterans respond positively to the new layout of the Claim Details page, with separate sections dedicated to Veteran actions and VA actions?
- Do Veterans respond positively to other new a11y and UX improvements in this version of CST? 

### Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that this new design for CST will accomplish the following: 
- Make it easier for Veterans to see requests for evidence submission and understand what those requests are
- Make CST more accessible to Veterans who use assistive technology
- Make it easier for Veterans to understand what is happening with their claim at any given time
- Make it clearer to Veterans whether or not they need to take any action to advance their claim

## Methodology	
Usability testing

### Location
Remote on Zoom

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
The intended audiences is Veterans who at some point filed a disability compensation claim with the VA in the last 10 years. 

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

15 total participants:

- 3 Black Veterans
- 3 Hispanic Veterans
- 3 Asian Veterans
- 7 Veterans age 55-64+

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

- 1 Native Veteran
- 1 LGBTQ+ Veteran (Gay, lesbian, or bisexual, Transgender, or Nonbinary, gender fluid, gender queer, Two-Spirit.

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email: rocio@coforma.io
* Date and time of pilot session: [Time TBD] June 8, 2023

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: June 12 - 16

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 min 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 3

### Availability
8 AM - 6 PM
