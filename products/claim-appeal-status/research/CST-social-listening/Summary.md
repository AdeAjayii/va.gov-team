Summary of social listening for Claim Status issues on VA.gov.

08/04/2020 By Christian Valla

The issues users brought up can be summarized as follows:

Upload documents errors or submit application errors: 

-   The documents veterans have uploaded does not show online. Sometimes they seemed to "have disappeared". 

-   When veterans upload documents, they get no information if the upload was successful or not. 

-   Veteran got an error when hitting 'Submit Application' on va.gov to file a disability claim: 'We're sorry, we can't submit your form right now'. He called the help number provided,  they had no help desk or any way to fix the problem. 

-   A veteran is appealing a claim. When he clicks "submit" a message says "sending", but nothing happens. Another veteran comments that the page will not show that the appeal is sent/submitted, but when he called, they had received his submission.

Claims or appeals disappear from VA.gov:

-   Several veterans experienced that their claims or appeals disappeared from VA.gov. 

-   One veteran found that this happens when something is missing, such as a signature or a document.

Appeals issues:

-   One veteran has problems finding his appeals and his VSO said they exist in another system. 

-   One veteran saw this message: "Your appeal is at the Board of Veterans' Appeals being reviewed by a Veterans Law Judge", but under the "Issues tab", it showed "closed" & "denied". His attorney said that the system shows that a decision has not yet been made.

Claim status errors:

-   Veterans when they look up the status of a claim sees a message like "We don't know your status". Some veterans experience this from the day the claim is submitted, until they get a decision.

-   A phone call revealed for one veteran that the claim in fact is "under review" or "pending review".

-   The claim status for one veteran said that "a judge is reviewing the claim", but when he called VA they said it's still in the Queue, not yet picked up by a judge. For the first 6 months, the claim didn't show up on VA.gov.

-   A veteran are seeing messages they don't understand such as: "request 2) DBQ insert condition, no longer needed". And: "request 3) exam request processing, no longer needed".

-   Same veteran got a letter saying that they would be calling him to set up an exam, and it never happened.

Lack of relevant updates:

-   A claim can be "in review" for a long time, without any relevant updates/info on what is actually happening. No way to know if the claim is progressing normally.

Below are relevant quotes that came from Hadit.com or Reddit.com within the last 12 months, regarding claim or appeal status on VA.gov.

From Hadit.com:

June 2019

I just logged on to VA.GOV today for the heck of it to see if anything has changed to my claim status. To my surprise, none of the docs that I have uploaded to the claim are there. They were all there Wednesday when I uploaded a new form, but today, it says I have not uploaded anything. There should be close to 10 docs. Very odd. I will log back on Monday and see if they are there I guess. If not, I have them all on my hard drive so I will resubmit them if need be

June 2019

My VA letter says I am total and permanent disabled, but there is no percentage. Also, the claim is closed but no letter yet? What in the world is going on at the Regional Office?

From Reddit.com:

June 2020

VA.gov "We don't know your status" (after Supplemental Claim) and other mysteries of VA.gov. VA.gov shows they received it, and since day one (February 15, 2020) shows "we don't know your status". So after a couple of weeks I call the 800-number and get someone who says "we don't know your status" means they are in the process of reviewing my supplemental. Why they can't put a simple status of 'under review' or 'pending review' is beyond me, but apparently it's a common thing. I mainly wanted to see how many have encountered the "we don't know your status" message after filing a supplemental claim?

August 2019

Recently claim status tracking was migrated to va.gov. I hate how they combined 3 steps into 1.

July 2019

I submitted a supplemental appeal a few weeks ago and the VA.gov website shows that the appeal was received, but doesn't know the status. The appeal is for an earlier effective date, which I don't know if that is a factor in the current status, but wanted to ask the group if anyone else has seen similar results on the website. Has anyone had this unknown status and then had their status update to something different?

-   Yeah mine said the same thing from the moment the claim showed up until my claim was closed. It never changed so don't expect it to.

-   I've got a similar appeal in (EED), and mine shows that for the last two months a judge is reviewing it now, but when I called BVA they said it's still sitting in the Queue and hadn't been picked up by any judge. For the first 6 months, it didn't even show up on VA.gov.

July 2020

I submitted an appeal with the help of a lawyer in June of 2019 On VA.gov It showed my lawyer requested all my military medical records back in June and as of April this year it says that claim is closed. Now I have a claim for a few things to bump me from %90 to %100. And it says the VA "does not know my status on this claim "? I've submitted many claims before but never saw this? Anyone have any ideas?

July 2020

My claim started sept 2019. My c&p was submitted on June 4. After I uploaded my c&p DBQ, I was able to see that she reviewed those files the same day and closed all open items/requests listed on VA.gov. People on the phone cannot tell me if I'm being reviewed or prepared for a decision or anything. Is this just going through review ( without a status update to benefits) or is it really just sitting there? Should I email the reviewer to ask or is it that crossing some serious line?

July 2020

I have a claim in and under files, it says request 2) DBQ insert condition, then under it says no longer needed. above that, it says request 3) exam request - processing and right under it says no longer needed. wtf is going on? I got a letter like two months ago saying that they would be calling me to set up an exam and it never happened. I don't think its a phone number or address change issue because I had an LHI exam 6 months ago for a different condition while living at the same address and same phone number. 

I don't have any voicemails about exams or anything. can somebody give me a guess as to what is going on? did they go to set up exams, go as far as sending me a letter saying they are setting up exams, and say "Nah, denied"?

March 2020

Error when hitting 'Submit Application' on va.gov to file my disability claim. (...)  I get an error saying 'We're sorry, we can't submit your form right now'. Then it gives me a number. I called the number and after a long wait, I was told that the merger of e-benefits into [va.gov](https://va.gov/) hasn't gone smoothly, and they have no help desk or any way to fix the problem. Am I SOL and just have to file a paper claim?

-   They should have just linked eBenefits from VA.gov, not merged them. It's MUCH more user friendly. Amateurs...

February 2020

I uploaded multiple files a week ago on VA.gov for a compensation claim but when I just checked I couldn't find them anywhere. They should be displayed, right?

-   I could have sworn that I'd uploaded docs one evening... Looked online a few days later and saw nothing. I uploaded them again and this time paid attention to the confirmation screens. I verified that the upload was completed but I never saw anything saying "you uploaded <documents> on <date>". Just my anecdotal experience. I'm not sure about the official expected appearance.

Sept. 2019

Can't see my disabilities or claims on either site for the entire day. My claims were supposed to complete between 6/29-07/03 and I'm just wondering if it's because of that or just general VA updates.

August 2019

My open claim got moved over to [va.gov](https://va.gov/) I'm not sure how to find my documents now. Not the ones I uploaded or the ones from QTC. Does anyone know how to find and review them? I can see the labels for them are in the files section but I'm not able to open them.

December 2019

For the past 4 days or so I've been trying to file a claim for increase through the [va.gov](https://va.gov/) website. However, every time I click submit it just hangs there saying "sending" and never actually sends. I've tried now on several different browsers and computers and it's the same thing every time. Does anyone have any advice? I'm really trying to avoid paper filing it.

-   I don't know about filing claims, but I know the uploads to current claims are working, but they aren't showing as received files. I called the phone number and they confirmed they received my submissions

November 2019

The appeal was filed in July 2019. I had a C & P exam in August for two of the four items I appealed. The status of my claim on va.gov has stated, "we don't know your status" since they received my appeal in July. Is my status updated on va.gov or ebenefits? Which to check, and what time frame should I expect?

-   Also curious- I've had the same "We don't know your status" since initially filing 3 months ago.

July 2020

I went to VA.gov to check and found the same thing: There aren't any open, historical, or appeal claims listed. It disappeared Monday and I haven't heard from VA.

-   Claims most often disappear in short order when they cannot be worked for a statutory reason; think a missing signature, etc. Ask the VSO what the most recently cleared or canceled end product is. If the answer is 400, then you are going to get a letter explaining why VA could not work your claim. If they can't answer that question you should consider a new VSO.

-   I did everything myself years ago and my claim disappeared multiple times.

June 2020

I filed for VA compensation regarding my back, mental health, and a few other issues. However, once I received my decision letter they never addressed my back issues and closed out my claim completely. I have no idea what to do. I do have appeals in the systems however, I can't even see anything on ebenefits or [va.gov](https://va.gov/) and supposedly according to a VSO my appeals are in a separate system. Does anyone have an opinion on this issue or any guidance would be appreciated?

September 2019

I did my daily login into [VA.gov](https://va.gov/) to check the status of my Appeal and under the Status, it says "Your appeal is at the Board of Veterans' Appeals being reviewed by a Veterans Law Judge", but under the "Issues" tab, it shows "closed", and "denied" above all my conditions being claimed. I spoke to my attorney, and she indicated that the system shows that a decision has not been made.

Is it probable that [VA.gov](https://va.gov/) is just screwed up? Or is it possible that it was denied, and somehow the system that reports issues is reporting before the system that reports statuses?

-   Ignore va.gov. It will drive you crazy. Your claim is not closed. If it's being reviewed by the BVA judge, then you are getting close to a final decision. However, be prepared for 2-5 months to process a favorable decision.

March 2020

Does anybody know what this means? I've never seen this before for any of my claims.

Request 8

Due Date: Not available Status: No Longer Needed

INC XXXXXXX  (Where X is a series of numbers that I did not divulge).

My claim was originally submitted back in Dec 2018 and estimated close date of Sept 2019. Been through two series of C&P exams and multiple diagnostics. Just trying to understand this status message. VA Call Center was no help with this.
