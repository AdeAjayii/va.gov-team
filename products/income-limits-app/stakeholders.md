## Relevant VA org structure

  - Healthcare Eligibility Center (HEC)
    - EED (Enrollment and Eligibility) – _believe this is a child office to HEC_
  - Veterans Transportation Program (VTP) – manages beneficiary travel reimbursement program

## Individuals

### In HEC: 
**Business SME:**
- Lindsey Peace – our main stakeholder and SME. She works in the Income Verification Division at HEC, so she has expertise in assessing which priority group Veterans are placed (only for Veterans whose priority group is affected by income, typically groups 5-8)

**Technical SME in HEC:**
- Joshua Faulkner (tech) – tech SME regarding the Veteran Enrollment System (VES), which keeps a well-governed database of income limits/thresholds going back years
  - Josh is our key to accessing the VES database, if we use that as (part of) our database

### In EED:
**Business SMEs:**
- Simone Gully (actully Enrollment Standardization Office (ESO)) - SME on how Veterans get enrolled, and how the enrollment systems work
- Antonio Presley – SME on how Veterans get enrolled, and how the enrollment systems work

### Technical SMEs in Member Services:
- Steve Ward - Requirements Office within Member Services, reports to Eric Swain. SME in limits themselves, builds a spreadsheet with new numbers for each year and distributes to owners of various systems within VHA that need to update their limits/thresholds annually (eg VistA)
  - Steve would be a key player if we need to maintain our own database of income limits, as he is a trusted source of annual updates

### Other SMEs in Member Services
- Stacy Rine – Executive Assistant in Member Services - she and Eric Swain were our original points of contact. However, we later learned that she was associated with the old wizard for reasons of history; she passed us to HEC (Lindsey) and is no longer involved.
- Eric Swain - Systems Management at VHA - one of our original points of contact. We spoke once, but he's not hands-on with the data. May have been the project manager for the old income limits wizard. No longer involved.
