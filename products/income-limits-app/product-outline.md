## Overview

Veterans, their caregivers, and their family members need a one-stop application to easily and quickly discover benefits available to them based on the veterans’ income, location, and number of dependents.

## Problem Statement

VA.gov currently lacks any easy or quick way to help veterans answer the question: “What benefits are available to me and my family?” Currently, veterans seeking this information must wade through extensive data tables to uncover their eligibility. 
How might we make this process simple, quick, and easy to find? 

 
## Desired User Outcomes

- In the case of an eligible Veteran: Quickly move on from “What am I eligible for?” to action (obtaining benefits).
- In the case of an ineligible Veteran: Understand what criteria were used to render a negative result, and provide a path to resolve questions.
- Self-service tool: no need for wait times associated with calling the VA


## Undesired User Outcomes

- Confusion or frustration with tool itself
- Feeling that unwelcome news (lack of eligibility) is opaque/unjustified, unfair, or wrongly determined.
- Incorrectly discouraging an eligible Veteran from pursuing benefits.


## Desired Business Outcomes

- Increase the use of VA’s self-service tools, and reduce phone calls to the VA.
- Maintain a single source of truth for income limits instead of the variety of documents currently available in disparate places (some of which are out of date).
- Better serve veterans by helping them get faster access to the benefits they are entitled to.

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Increased phone call load to VA about income limits (caused by confusion, etc)
