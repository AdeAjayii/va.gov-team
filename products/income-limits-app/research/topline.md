This research summary is the result of a partial synthesis process. After the first four research sessions were conducted, we realized that we weren't getting the data that we needed. This research study had been planned a while ago to be broad discovery research on eligibility for VA health care, whereas now more focused research was desired to inform the design process for a new income limits wizard. In addition, the participants recruited didn't fit the criteria that we requested in the research plan, and even if they did, they were in priority categories that didn't consider eligibility and income limits. We cancelled the 10 remaining research sessions, and this topline report is a summary of what we learned.

# Introduction
The purpose of this research was to **learn about Veteran use cases for determining eligibility for VA health care**.

# Research questions
- What events drive a Veteran to consider their eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions?
- How do Veterans first determine eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions?
- Do Veterans think about/consider their eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions? 
  - If they do, when and how do they consider their eligibility?
- What problems do Veterans encounter when trying to determine eligibility?
- What do Veterans need to do after they understand their eligibility?

# Hypotheses
- Veterans will likely not know the current application exists, and the VA.gov may not be Veterans' go-to source of information around benefit eligibility.
- Veterans with benefits will have worked with someone in person or over the phone to get help determining eligibility and applying for benefits.
- Veterans may not be aware of when or how their eligibility for benefits was determined.

# Method	
We conducted **semi-structured interviews** to guide Veterans through a chronological re-telling of their experience(s) determining benefit eligibility. Sessions were conducted over Zoom on October 19-20, 2022.

## Participants
We talked to **4 Veterans**.
- X had a VA.gov account
- X except one had VA health care

# Findings
1.  NONE of the 4 participants we talked to had met the intended screening criteria of having recently enrolled in health care, currently in the process of applying for health care or interested in applying, or receiving health care and having recently experienced a change in dependents, income or location. 
2.  NONE of the 4 participants had applied for VA health care in the last 3 months, which was another recruiting criterion. All had been enrolled in VA health care for at least a year (some much longer), but they all had decent recall about the process.
3.  We learned some things about eligibility but not much about income limits or changes in dependents or location.
4.  All 4 Veterans **assumed they were eligible because of their disability or the length of service**. 
     1. Two participants were 100% disabled, and another participant had combat service--all of which affected their [VA priority groups](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/priority-groups/) for VA health care.
     1. Only one ever considered income, and that was not when initially applying but later when she was concerned that her increase in income might disqualify her from the VA healthcare she had because it was above the stated income limits. Later, she found out that because she’s in Priority Group 5 (for Desert Storm combat), she’s eligible for VA health care no matter what life changes happen.
> *"Had no doubt [of my eligibility]. had enough experience in the military...knew I had to establish eligibility but wasn't concerned...knew health care was free" (p1).*
> *"Just knew I was eligible...I've always known it was free [told by other Veterans]...just provide a DD214 and scan a copy of my retired ID" (p3).*
> *"Assume you're eligible and find a way to get through the bureaucracy" (p4).*
1. The participants decided to apply for VA health care for different reasons: 
     1. Heard that you could get a free annual physical at the VA (2 participants)  
     1. Encouraged to get care for PTSD (1 participant)  
     3. Had a medical problem that wasn't covered by their current insurance and heard that the VA would cover it (1 participant)
> *"A gentleman really pushed me to go get help through the VA for my PTSD. It was a combat Veteran taking care another combat Veteran. 'Even if you don’t think you have an issue you do. Just go get checked out.' That was years before I applied" (p3).*
1. Three of 4 participants said that they got information about VA health care and eligility from other Veterans. Two participants specifically mentioned hearing this from other Veterans at the American Legion.
> *"A retired Colonel in the American Legion tells everyone how to get things done with short cuts without getting frustrated. You need to circumvent the system...[learn] how to get around the roadblocks to get to the right person" (p4).* 
3. Participants shared a few barriers around eligibility:
     1. Getting told "no" by someone at VA, when you know that you're eligible
     2. Not knowing your assigned priority group and what it means (e.g., eligible even if your income increases)
4. Participants discussed the following barriers to applying for VA health care or considering whether to apply:
     1. Closest VA medical center is too far away from home
     
# Recommendations 
1. If we want to learn more about how Veterans think about eligibility for VA health care in terms of income limits, we need to change our recruiting criteria to focus on Veterans in the [VA priority groups](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/priority-groups/) for which income is considered.
