This research summary is the result of a partial synthesis process. After the first four research sessions were conducted, we realized that we weren't getting the data that we needed. This research study had been planned a while ago to be broad discovery research on eligibility for VA health care, whereas now more focused research was desired to inform the design process for a new income limits wizard. In addition, the participants recruited didn't fit the criteria that we requested in the research plan, and even if they did, they were in priority categories that didn't consider eligibility and income limits. We cancelled the rest of the research sessions, and this topline report is a summary of what we learned.

# Introduction
The purpose of this research was to **learn about Veteran use cases for determining eligibility for VA health care**.

# Research questions
- What events drive a Veteran to consider their eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions?
- How do Veterans first determine eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions?
- Do Veterans think about/consider their eligibility for health care benefits and prescriptions? 
  - If they do, when and how do they consider their eligibility?
- What problems do Veterans encounter when trying to determine eligibility?
- What do Veterans need to do after they understand their eligibility?

# Hypotheses
- Veterans will likely not know the current application exists, and the VA.gov may not be Veterans' go-to source of information around benefit eligibility.
- Veterans with benefits will have worked with someone in person or over the phone to get help determining eligibility and applying for benefits.
- Veterans may not be aware of when or how their eligibility for benefits was determined.

# Method	
We conducted **semi-structured interviews** to guide Veterans through a chronological re-telling of their experience(s) determining benefit eligibility. Sessions were conducted over Zoom on October 19-20, 2022.
