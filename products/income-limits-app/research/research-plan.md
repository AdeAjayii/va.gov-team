# Research Plan for Public Websites, Income Limits App, June 2022

## Background
An [existing application](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apps/explorer/AnnualIncomeLimits/HealthBenefits) allows Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to look up the income limits for VA National medical benefits and prescriptions based on location and number of dependents. 

However, there are multiple issues with the existing application, which lacks:
- Reliably accurate data
- Plain language
- Clearly defined use cases, usability design, and testing to ensure that it is aligned to Veteran needs and is intuitive for Veterans to use

How might we rebuild and modernize this application using clearly defined Veteran use cases to better align with Veterans' needs to understand their VA benefit eligibility as it relates to income, location, and dependent information?

### OCTO Objectives 

This research aligns with the following [OCTO Objectives]([url](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme))

North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Goals:

5. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
7. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Percent of applications submitted online (maybe, if we can help Veterans move from this tool to online application)
- Benefit use and enrollment
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
1. Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
2. Starting up (Attending to health needs, Finding something to do/Balancing finances, Finding a place to live)
3. Putting down roots (Starting, growing or maintaining my family)
4. Retiring (Taking care of my health)
5. Aging (Not listed in journey, but dealing with death of spouse)

## Research Goals	
What are Veteran use cases for determining eligibility for VA National medical benefits and prescriptions?

### Outcome
Learnings will inform redesign of the application, taking into account context surrounding Veteran use cases to make the application experience as intuitive and seamless as possible.

### Research questions
- What events drive a Veteran to consider their eligibility for medical benefits and prescriptions?
- How do Veterans first determine eligibility for medical benefits and prescriptions? 
- Then, how do Veterans determine eligibility again after a life event (i.e. marriage, having a child, relocating, retirement) changes their circumstances?
- What problems do Veterans encounter when trying to determine eligibility?
- What do Veterans need to do after they understand their eligibility?

### Hypothesis
What do you already know about this problem space? 
- I know nothing/very little about this problem space.
- As of 2016, about 60% of Veterans are eligible for VA care and fewer than half of those eligible use VA health benefits. [Source.](https://www.rand.org/pubs/periodicals/health-quarterly/issues/v6/n1/12.html) 

What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so donâ€™t skip this step!)
- Veterans will likely not know the current application exists, and the VA.gov may not be Veterans' go-to source of information around benefit eligibility.
- Veterans with benefits will have worked with someone in person or over the phone to get help determining eligibility and applying for benefits.
- Veterans may not be aware of when or how their eligibility for benefits was determined.

## Method	
Semi-structured interviews to guide Veteran through a chronological re-telling of experience(s) determining benefit eligibility

### Location
Interviews will take place remotely to ensure participation by Veterans from a diverse range of geographical locations. Zoom is preferred video conferencing software.

### Research materials

## Recruitment	
### Recruitment approach
Intended audience is Veterans and recruitment is through Perigean. 

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
12 total Veterans to be recruited as participants for this study. 

All participants will have responded:
1. "Yes" or "I don't know" to question 22 of the recruitment survey: "Do you currently receive any VA benefits or services?
2. "Health care benefits" to question 23 of the recruitment survey: "Which VA benefits or services do you have experience with?"

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
1. Year received first VA benefit
- At least 7 participants: within the past 3 years

2. How applied for first VA benefit
- At least 1 participants: On my own, on paper
- At least 2 participants: On my own, online
- At least 1 participants: On my own, in person
- At least 1 participants: With the help of a VSO or With the help of a transition service officer at Department of Defense
- At least 1 participants: With the help of a fellow veteran
- At least 1 participants: Other

3. How often go online to access VA benefits and services
- At least 2 participants: Never
- At least 2 participants: Once per year or less, or once per quarter
- At least 3 participants: Once per month, A few times per month, Once a week, A few times per week, or About once a day

Additional screening questions:
1. Have you applied for healthcare benefits *more than once*? [answer should be yes to qualify.]
2. 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: up to 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
