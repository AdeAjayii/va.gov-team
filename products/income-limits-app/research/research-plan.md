# Research Plan for Public Websites, Income Limits App, June 2022

## Background
An [existing application](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/apps/explorer/AnnualIncomeLimits/HealthBenefits) allows Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to look up the income limits for VA National medical benefits and prescriptions based on location and number of dependents. 

However, there are multiple issues with the existing application, which lacks:
- Reliably accurate data
- Plain language
- Clearly defined use cases, usability design, and testing to ensure that it is aligned to Veteran needs and is intuitive for Veterans to use

How might we rebuild and modernize this application using clearly defined Veteran use cases to better align with Veterans' needs?

### OCTO Objectives 

This research aligns with the following [OCTO Objectives]([url](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme))

North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Goals:

5. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
7. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Percent of applications submitted online (maybe, if we can help Veterans move from this tool to online application)
- Benefit use and enrollment
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
1. Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
2. Starting up (Attending to health needs, Finding something to do/Balancing finances, Finding a place to live)
3. Putting down roots (Starting, growing or maintaining my family)
4. Retiring (Taking care of my health)
5. Aging (Not listed in journey, but dealing with death of spouse)

## Research Goals	
What are Veteran use cases for determining eligibility for VA National medical benefits and prescriptions?

### Outcome
Learnings will inform redesign of the application, taking into account context surrounding Veteran use cases to make the application experience as intuitive and seamless as possible.

### Research questions
- What events drive a Veteran to consider their eligibility for medical benefits and prescriptions?
- How do Veterans first determine eligibility for medical benefits and prescriptions? 
- Then, how do Veterans determine eligibility again after a life event (i.e. marriage, having a child, relocating, retirement) changes their circumstances?
- What problems do Veterans encounter when trying to determine eligibility?
- What do Veterans need to do after they understand their eligibility?

### Hypothesis
What do you already know about this problem space? 
- I know nothing/very little about this problem space.
- As of 2016, about 60% of Veterans are eligible for VA care and fewer than half of those eligible use VA health benefits. [Source.](https://www.rand.org/pubs/periodicals/health-quarterly/issues/v6/n1/12.html) 

What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so donâ€™t skip this step!)
- Veterans will likely not know the current application exists, and the VA.gov may not be Veterans' go-to source of information around benefit eligibility.
- Veterans with benefits will have worked with someone in person or over the phone to get help determining eligibility and applying for benefits.
- Veterans may not be aware of when or how their eligibility for benefits was determined.

## Method	
Semi-structured interviews to guide Veteran through a chronological re-telling of experience(s) determining benefit eligibility

### Location
Interviews will take place remotely to ensure participation by Veterans from a diverse range of geographical locations. Zoom is preferred video conferencing software.

### Research materials
- [Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/income-limits-app/research/conversation-guide.md)
	
## Recruitment	
### Recruitment approach
Intended audience is Veterans and recruitment is through Perigean. 

### Recruitment criteria
12 total Veterans to be recruited as participants for this study: One group of participants will have recently (within the past 3 years) applied for their first VA benefit. Of this first group, there should be a diversity of application methods. A second group of participants will have recently re-applied for health care benefits. Both groups should have a diversity of responses to "How often do you go online to access VA benefits and services" and recruiting for both groups should employ [maximum variation sampling (MVS)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md). 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
All 12 participants will have responded:
1. "Yes" or "I don't know" to question 22 of the recruitment survey: "Do you currently receive any VA benefits or services?
2. "Health care benefits" to question 23 of the recruitment survey: "Which VA benefits or services do you have experience with?"

3. Year received first VA benefit
- At least 7 participants: within the past 3 years

4. How applied for first VA benefit
- At least 1 participants: On my own, on paper
- At least 2 participants: On my own, online
- At least 1 participants: On my own, in person
- At least 1 participants: With the help of a VSO or With the help of a transition service officer at Department of Defense
- At least 1 participants: With the help of a fellow veteran
- At least 1 participants: Other

5. How often go online to access VA benefits and services
- At least 2 participants: Never
- At least 2 participants: Once per year or less, or once per quarter
- At least 3 participants: Once per month, A few times per month, Once a week, A few times per week, or About once a day

**Additional screening questions:**
The additional 5 participants (those that received first VA benefits longer ago than past 3 years) should answer the following screening questions:
6. Have you applied for healthcare benefits *more than once*? [answer should be yes to qualify.]
7. How long ago did you most recently apply for healthcare benefits? [answer should be within the past 3 years].

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

[Maximum variation sampling (MVS)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md)
- Geographic distribution: 25% east coast, 25% midwest, 25% south, 25% west coast
- 50% aged 55-64+
- 50% with an identified cognitive disability
- 50% primarily mobile users
- 30% people of color (especially Native)
- 25% in a rural area
- 25% without a degree
- 17% with immigrant origins (either immigrant themselves or with immigrant family)
- 10% women
- 10% LGBTQ

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.
