## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Florence and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about applying for healthcare benefits.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** 
- **In this session, there is no right or wrong.** I'm not looking to test you or your ability, or make sure you're doing something the right way. Chances are, if you've experienced something or done something a certain way, others have too! I really just want to learn from you/your experience. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

2. Who do you live with?
3. What do you like to do for fun?

## Guided Storytelling - X minutes

_Note about the following questions: 
Moderator is not expected to ask all questions as written below. These questions are more like guidelines to help the moderator if they're unsure what to ask next, or unsure how to phrase a question. Overall, this time should be used to get participant to explain their process of applying for health care benefits to see if, when, how, etc. eligibility comes into the picture._

Great to know a little bit more about you! Let's now turn towards talking about health care benefits. 

1. So just to start, when did you first apply for health care benefits?

### If not the only time applied for health care benefits:

3a. How many other times did you apply for health care benefits?

3b. What was it that caused you to apply more than once?

3c. When was the most recent time you applied?

### If yes: Okay, for the rest of our conversation we're going to talk about what that experience was like for you.

## Emergency Exit
[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
