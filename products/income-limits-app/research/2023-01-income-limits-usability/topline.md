This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to **get user feedback on the redesigned income limits application**.

## Participants
We talked to **8 Veterans**, one of whom was also a Veteran's family member (spouse). 
- 6 of 8 used a smartphone during the session.
- *None* of them had VA health care, a VA pension, or disability compensation of 50% or higher.


## Preliminary Findings
### Usability Successes
1. All participants understood the purpose of the app--to find out if they might be eligible for VA health care based on their income before applying
4. All participants understood the income ranges and knew which one to select to open, based on the moderator's prompt.
2. All participants found it easy and intuitive to answer one question at a time (the subtask design pattern).
3. All participants used the *Continue* button without any hesitation, and some used the *Back* button, too (others didn't need to).

### Usability Issues
1. Participants found parts of the benefit descriptions under each income range to be unclear and had questions about them.
2. Most participants didn't open the "How to estimate your income for this tool" accordion and didn't mention any deductions. They simply used the salary number from the moderator to select an income range to open. 
3. Participants had different interpretations for the dependents question. Some said that they would enter what they put on their income taxes, and others remembered this incorrectly or perhaps were thinking of the VA's definition of dependents, which includes spouse.
4. Participants found the landing page in the prototype ([Your health care costs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/) to be very long (especially on a phone) and found it difficult to locate the Income Limits link in it (which was included in two places).

## Next Steps
- Synthesize data
- Write research report
