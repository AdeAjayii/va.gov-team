## User Tasks

### Task 1: [Wayfinding] 
*(if they DON'T have VA health care)* Let's say that you're wondering if you're eligible for VA health care with your current income.

*(if they already have VA health care)* Let's say that your income just changed, and you want to know whether you're still eligible for VA health care or if your benefits might change.

*if they have 50% or higher disability rating, do they say that income limits don't apply to them? Y / N / ____________*

*if they have a VA pension, do they say that income limits don't apply to them? Y / N / ____________*

Can you show me how you would find out if you're eligible for VA health care with your current income?

- *RECORD what they do: Google / VA.gov / words looking/searching for: _______________________*

- *RECORD where they go on VA.gov: Cost of care page / Eligibility page / ______________________*

### Task 2: [Open prototype] 

I have a web page that I'd like you to look at while you're sharing your screen with me over Zoom. It's a prototype that isn't very interactive, and so before clicking anywhere, I'd like you to tell me what you might do.

While you're looking at the prototype, I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, and what you're unsure about. I'm looking for **your feedback**, including any issues that you see or questions that you have. 

I'll have you start from a URL that I'm going to *[dictate/put into the Zoom chat]* for you to click on: **bit.ly/41Yy7wz**
- *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test.)*

Do you see the link? 

*If prototype doesn't open, copy the URL and open in a new incognito window (Chrome), private window (Firefox, Safari) or InPrivate (Edge)*

What are your impressions of what you're looking at? *(RECORD)*

Could you try to use this to find out if you're eligible for VA health care with your current income? Please explain what you want to do before clicking anywhere.
- *(Click: income limits--under "Will I need to pay..." or "Does VA verify..."?)*

### Task 3: [Intro page of app] 
Let's talk before you click anywhere...What are your impressions of this page?
What do you think you can do here?

Do you think this tool would be useful for you or not? WHY?
*(want to get a sense for HOW useful it might be for them)*

If not, who would it be useful for?

*click "Get started"*
- *(RECORD all comments*)

### Task 4: [Answer questions in app] 
How would you use this? Please talk me through what you would do, but **do not** click anywhere yet.

- *(when click on an entry field and then see different info)* This prototype isn't interactive enough to let you enter your own information, but it will jump to a new screen with some information already filled out. I'd like to you tell me what you would enter for yourself or what questions you have about it.

- *(RECORD all comments and anything confusing re the interactions on each screen of the prototype:)*
  - *Zip code--*
  - *# of Dependents--*
  - *Back, Continue buttons--*
  - *Review your information screen--*
  - *The year 2022 vs. 2023--*

### Task 5: [Results screen]
What are your impressions of this page? *(RECORD what they say)*

- *RECORD: Which accordions did they open? How to estimate income / $29K / $29-43K / $43-81K / $81-90K / $90K or more*

Can you explain what this page means to you?

How is your income involved here?

- *RECORD: Understand that it's your previous year's income that's relevant? yes / no*

If your salary last year was around $40,000, what might that mean for your eligibility for VA health care? *(RECORD)*

Can you tell me what benefits you might get? 
- *PROBE on meaning of "Free VA health care for most types of care"*
- *PROBE on meaning of "copays"*

If your salary last year was around $28,000, what might that mean? *(RECORD)*

If your salary last year was around $83,000, what might that mean? *(RECORD)*

If your salary last year was around $90,000, what might that mean? *(RECORD)*

How sure are you that these benefits *would apply* if your salary was around $90,000?

- *(Could probe)* How certain are you that you *don't qualify for more benefits*? 

What if your salary was around $100,000? *(RECORD)*

*RECORD any comments about...*
- *benefits (in bullets)--*
- *income/deductions--*
- *the year 2022 vs. 2023--*
- *wanting to see questions answered (zip code, # dependents)--*
- *about the word "Select"*

### Task 6: [What next]
Please stay on this screen. Based on what you see in this screen, what do you think about this information and the question of eligibility for VA health care?
- *RECORD what they say: definitive answer / only part of the answer / need to apply to know for sure / _____________*
- *Make sure that participant is talking about what they're seeing in the app,* and NOT *what they knew before this session!*

How would you decide what to do next? 

What would you do next? 
- *(RECORD: apply for VA health care / Review info entered / Back in browser / ________________)*

How did this tool help or not help you decide what to do?

### Task 7: [Check info entered]
Now you want to check whether you entered your location correctly. How could you do that? 
- *(RECORD: Review info link / Back in browser to review page or zip code screen / ________________)*
- *If surprised by dependents screen, ask what they expected to see (Continue button --> Review page?)*

### Task 8: [Change year]
Suppose that youâ€™re in the process of appealing a health care claim from 2021, and you want to see the income limits from that year. What could you do? Again, please tell me where you want to click before doing it.
- *(RECORD: click on "Get past income limits" / _________________________________)*
  - *any comments about the wording "get past"?*

- *(RECORD all comments and anything confusing re the interactions on each screen of the prototype:)*
  - *Zip code--*
  - *Anything about the year 2020--*
  - *# of Dependents--*
