## Research Goals
The new Income Limits application enables Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to **look up the income limits for VA health care benefits** by answering several questions.

There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) when they might want to know whether they may be eligible for VA health care with their current income:
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Attending to health needs)
- Taking care of myself (Recognizing and addressing mental health needs, Managing primary care and chronic health issues, Seeking support for an acute health event, Maintaining my health)
- Retiring (Taking care of my health)
- Aging (Managing my declining health)

The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the newly redesigned income limits application**. Learnings will help refine the design of the application before launch.

## Research Questions
1. What are Veterans' expectations of income eligibility for VA health care? (ask before showing app)
1. Where do Veterans expect to find this app? (i.e., Costs of Care page, Eligibility page, etc.)
1. Do Veterans understand the questions in the app? Is anything unclear or confusing?
1. Do Veterans find a summary page helpful for verifying the information entered?
1. Do Veterans understand the income limits presented in the app results page?  Is anything unclear or confusing?
1. Do Veterans understand the relevant year of income for their eligibility? 
1. Do Veterans understand the health care benefits shown in the app results page?  Is anything unclear or confusing?
1. How far do Veterans scroll down the app results page?
1. Do Veterans understand deductions and how that affects their income? (Did they see the details about this?)
1. After seeing the information presented in the app results page, what do Veterans want to do next? 
1. Do Veterans understand that they can use this to find the income limits for a previous year (not 2023)? Reaction to it not being part of the flow?


## Methodology 
We conducted **usability testing** on April 5-11, 2023 to get feedback from research participants using a click-through prototype over Zoom. Perigean recruited the participants.

**We talked to 8 Veterans**, one of whom was also a Veteran's family member.
- 6 of 8 used a smartphone for the session, and 2 used a computer
- ALL did NOT have VA health care
- ALL do NOT receive a pension from the VA
- ALL do NOT get VA disability compensation for a service-connected disability rating of 50% or higher

For more details, see [Who we talked to](#who-we-talked-to).


## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. Veterans will be able to answer the questions in the app for themselves.
2. From the information presented in the app results page, Veterans will understand how the different income thresholds affect the health care benefits they might qualify for, including if their income is higher than all of the thresholds.
3. Zip code is sufficient/comfortable for Veterans to specify the location where they live.
4. After seeing the summary page with information entered, Veterans will have confidence in the accuracy of the results page.
5. Veterans understand the difference between the desired year for benefits and the year that they need to use for income (the previous year).
6. Veterans understand that thresholds in the app are not final answers, and only by applying for VA health care can they learn what benefits they're eligible for.
7. Veterans don't need to see their answers to the questions while looking at the results page (i.e., having answers only on the review page is enough). 
8. The results page is an intuitive place for Veterans to seek information about historical income limits (vs. earlier in the interaction flow).
9. The intro page communicates that income limits apply to only some Veterans.

### All participants understood the purpose of the app and found it easy to use
- All participants understood what the app was for--to find out before applying if they might be eligible for VA health care based on their income.
> *"Figure out even if I'm eligible by income before I continue on to do further research" (p8)*.

> *"See if I qualify or not based on income" (p9)*.
- All participants found it **easy to answer the questions**, which were posed one question at a time (the subtask design pattern). A few participants commented that it was really easy to answer the questions on their phone. 
- All participants **used the *Continue* button without any hesitation**, and some used the *Back* button, too (others didn't need to).
- All participants **understood the income ranges** and figured out which one to open. One participant did say that they expected to have ranges with even thousands of dollars (i.e., _$82,000 - $89,999, $90,000 or more_ instead of _$81,900 - $90,089, $90,090 or more_).
> *"Not a lot of reading, not a lot of choices...As your income goes down, the more benefits you would receive" (p7)*.

- Once they found the _Get past income limits_ link, participants didn't have any difficulties doing the **Past Income limits task**. One participant wanted to try a different zip code for the city he's considering moving to in order to learn if he would be eligible for VA health care there. Another participant said they might look at past income limits to see if there was a pattern of increases each year so they could get a sense of what they might pay for copays in the future.

### There were a few navigation issues within the app
- ***Review the information you entered*** link--Two participants did _not_ use this link to go back from the results page to the summary page. They used the _Back_ button in their browser instead, though one participant was concerned that this might exit them out of the app (it didn't). A different participant thought that this link would take them to information that they filled out previously on VA forms (which is incorrect).
- RECOMMENDATION: Make the *Review the information you entered* link more prominent in location and/or visual treatment/layout (e.g., top of page or maybe look like a button like the _Continue_ button). Maybe explore how other VA.gov pages enable you to navigate to view/edit previous information.
- **_Get past income limits_** link--Two participants had difficulty finding this link on the results page. One of them looked in the _How to estimate your income for this tool_ accordion, but this wasn't relevant. They also wanted to click the _Expand all_ accordion above the salary ranges. One of the participants said that he was looking for a search tool at various points, but he never found one.
- RECOMMENDATION: If we want the _Get past income limits_ link to be easier to find, consider moving it up higher on the results page.
 
- After 1 participant used the _Review Info_ page to return to the zip code page and then clicked the _Continue_ button, they said they were surprised to see the _Dependents_ page. They expected to see the _Review Info_ page again. Other participants saw this, too, and said that they must be going back through all the screens.
- RECOMMENDATION: If someone navigates from the _Review Info_ page to another page, consider having the _Continue_ button take you back to the _Review Info_ page instead of the next question.


### Participants had difficulty understanding some of the benefit descriptions under the income ranges
Participants found some of the text to be ambiguous, which made it difficult for them to understand the specific benefits and compare them across income ranges. Each of the phrases below was questioned by 3 of 8 participants (but not the same participants for each): 
- **"VA health care"**--medical? dental? vision? only at a VA hospital?
- **"most types of care"**--outpatient office visits for routine appointments and for illness? lab work and screenings? inpatient care? surgery? dental? vision? for dependents, too?
- **"copays" *vs.* "full copays"**--dollar amounts? how much for surgery and is there a limit? 

> *"I don't understand. I would have to ask someone or look it up" (p8)*

- RECOMMENDATION: Add more description to the benefits and/or provide links to details for "VA health care", "most types of care", "copays", and "full copays".
- RECOMMENDATION: Consider standardizing the bullets for each benefit so it's easier to compare them across income ranges: 
  - Outpatient and inpatient visits
  - Prescriptions
  - Travel pay (if applicable)

### Participants had some confusion with terminology used in the questions, including the word "dependents"
3 of 8 participants didn't know what **"Aid and Attendance benefits"** were but assumed that they didn't have it.
1 participant didn't know what **"Housebound allowance"** meant, but assumed they didn't have it.
In the question *Did you get a VA pension from VBA last year?*, 1 participant didn't know what **"VBA"** meant and said that they felt embarrassed about it and also distracted from the task at hand.

> *"I get embarrassed when I don’t know what things mean when they are asked. It also makes me start questioning if I should be receiving these other things, and it gets me off track. Makes me want to look into those things." (p7)*

Participants had different interpretations for the **dependents** question. Some said they would enter what they put on their income taxes, and others remembered this information incorrectly or might have been thinking of the VA's definition of dependents, which includes your spouse.
- Half of the participants entered what they put on their income taxes, though one said that he'd ask his wife what that was because she does their taxes. 
- Two participants wanted to enter 1 for their wife, with whom they file taxes jointly.
- One participant entered 2 for his grown kids, which are likely not dependents in the income tax sense.
- One participant wanted to enter 1 for himself. Was he maybe thinking of income tax exemptions?

- RECOMMENDATION: Clarify the meaning of "dependents" in this question per income taxes or VA rules, and add details to the question so people know how to answer. According to a VA subject-matter expert (in an email dated 4/17/2023), dependents include *your spouse*, unmarried children under 18 (or 18-23 if attending school full-time or disabled prior to reaching age 18), and parents if in the Veteran's direct care and whose net worth and income are below a fixed limit.
- RECOMMENDATION: Delete the text "from VBA" in the pension question (or if this must be kept in, write out "Veterans Beefits Administration") because it's confusing as is.
- RECOMMENDATION: Add more description to the "Aid and Attendance" and "Housebound allowance" pages and/or provide links to details because some Veterans don't know what they mean and want to understand.

### The landing page was very long to read on a phone, and participants found it difficult to find one of the two _Check our current income limits_ links 
The **landing page** in the prototype was a static version of the [Your health care costs page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/) on which the only working links were two copies of "Check our current income limits". When the participant clicked on one of those two links, they saw the prototype screens for the income limits tool.

Scrolling down this very long landing page on a phone took a while, especially for the 3 participants who were reading everything on that page. The two income limits links were several scroll distances down the page, and there was more to the page below these links. 
- 2 participants seemed lost in the long page while scrolling. 
- 1 participant never found either of the income limits links. 
- Another participant found one of them but continued reading down the page, and when they scrolled back up, they had trouble finding the link again. 
- 2 other participants missed both links on their first look through the page but found one later. 
- 6 participants clicked on the first income limits link (in the section _Will I need to pay for any of my care, tests or medications?_).
- Only 1 participant clicked on the second income limits link (in the section "Does VA verify the information I provide?"), and they remarked:
> *"Kind of far down on the page" (p9).*

- RECOMMENDATION: Consider restructuring the content on the [Your health care costs page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/) page to put all income limits info closer together and move the income limits app link closer to the top of page.

### Participants used the salary numbers provided by the moderator to decide which income limit accordion to open on the results page, and most didn't mention their household income or deductions

Most participants (7 of 8) **didn't open the _How to estimate your income for this tool" accordion_**, which describes household income and deductions that may apply. Two of them later opened it during the past limits task.
3 participants said they expected to use the AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) number from last year's income taxes, assuming household income but no additional deductions. 

> *"I automatically went to the numbers" (p6)*.

- RECOMMENDATION: Be more explicit about household income and deductions on the results page, without needing to open any accordions. For example, consider changing the first sentence from "We use your last year's income to determine..." to "We use your last year's _household_ income _minus deductions (such as out-of-pocket medical expenses, education costs, and funeral/burial expenses for a spouse or child)_ to determine..."

### After seeing the benefits data on the results page, participants had varying interpretations of it and what to do next
We have data from only 6 of 8 participants because the other 2 participants didn't get to that task (due to arriving to the session late or dropping off the internet during the session). 
- 4 of 6 participants thought that the **benefits were not certain because of the phrase "may be eligible"** above each of the lists of benefits. None of these participants had opened the "How to estimate your income for this tool" accordion, so they were guessing based on the phrasing. 

- **After seeing the app results, here's what participants planned to do next**:
  - Click on _Find out if you may be eligible_ link (4 participants), though this didn't work in the prototype
  - Apply for VA health care (1 participant)
  - Do more research to find specific coverages (e.g., copay amounts) before applying for health care, though if income is over 90K, wouldn't do too much more research (1)
  - Call or visit a nearby VA facility (1)
  - Apply for disability because probably won't qualify based on income limits (1)
  > *"From what I read, I would not be able to receive health care unless I have a disability...I may need to figure out if I would have a disability rating because I may not get anything from the VA in terms of healthcare on my own based off income" (p7)*.
  > *"I didn't apply for disability because I feel bad. Other people came back missing limbs, and I'm pretty OK compared to them. But now my hearing is bad, and I'm wondering if it's because of the firing ranges. How do I prove that?" (p7)*.

- RECOMMENDATION: Consider clarifying in the content on the [Your health care costs page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/) page that if your income is too high, applying for disability may not be what you should do next.


- Most participants (5 of 6) **didn't realize that you needed to apply for VA health care** in order to find out for sure if you qualify. 
- 2 participants figured out later in the session that they needed to apply--only after they opened the "How to estimate your income for this tool" accordion in the "past year" task.
> *"Oh! You need to apply. So not take this information at face value" (p1)*.
- RECOMMENDATION: Make the text "To find out if you're eligible, apply now" more visually prominent on the results page because as it is now, participants ignored it.

## Additional Insights

_Any additional insights that aren't "key findings." These can be powerful comments from users that don’t represent a pattern in this study, but may be part of one outside this study._

### Feedback on the app intro page
We heard **additional feedback on the app intro page**. Each of the comments below is from only one participant, but could be used to potentially tweak the content copy on the page.
- Based on the first sentence ("You may be eligible for VA health care based on your VA disability rating, service history, or other factors"), 1 participant **expected to be asked about their disability rating and service history**, but those are actually reasons that you would NOT need the app.
  - RECOMMENDATION: Lead with a clearer distinction between income limits and what factors make them relevant or not (e.g., "_Not everyone is affected by income limits._ You may be _automatically_ eligible for VA health care based on your VA disability rating, service history, or other factors. If you're not eligible based on these factors, you may still qualify if your income is within our limit.")

- 1 participant was **concerned about how long this income limits app will take to go through** because they'll probably need to create a password and gather a lot of documents (e.g., investments, W2s, DD214). After going through the app pages, this participant was relieved.
>  *"Wasn't overwhelming with requiring a ton of info, such as finding a DD214, and creating a new password. It was quick. that's important" (p7)*.
- RECOMMENDATION: Add to the intro page how long to expect and what's needed so people know it's quick and easy (e.g., "Here’s what you’ll need to apply: your household income and number of dependents from the last year...", "It should take about 3 minutes."
  
- 1 participant who had a cognitive disability said that the block of **text was too much to read and understand**. There are already 
> *"Too much text and not enough separation [formatting-wise] of it. Want a tldr" (p1)*.

- 1 participant suggested adding a little more text to **encourage Veterans to try to get these benefits** if they need them.
> *"Maybe there is some small wording that you can put in that encourages Veterans to get these benefits if you need them...I don't want to take away from someone else who needs it more. 'Hey, we encourage you to do this. Let's find out if you're eligible'--like selling it to me. You really want me to find out if I'm eligible. A little positive affirmation. Just don’t add  a lot more reading. It's very cut and dry...not warm and welcoming" (p7).
- RECOMMENDATION: Consider adding to the intro page some friendly encouragement to use this tool to find out if you're eligible for VA health care.

### Awareness of income limits for VA health care eligibility
- **Half of the participants (4 of 8) hadn't heard anything about income eligibility for VA health care**. One of these participants assumed that income wasn't relevant because her husband receives VA health care because of his service-connected disability (and so probably not subject to income limits).

### How participants looked for income limits without the new app
Before showing participants the design prototype for the new income limits app, we asked how they would find out if they are eligible for VA health care with their current income.
- **7 of 8 participants started with a search**--6 of them from Google, and 1 from their phone home screen. 
  - 5 of the 7 who searched found the [Annual Income Limits table](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/annual_income_limits_health_benefits.asp). 
  - 2 participants couldn't find anything relevant after several google searches. They kept landing on the [non-modernized benefits.va.gov page](https://benefits.va.gov/benefits/) and not finding anything about income limits there.
- 1 participant went straight to VA.gov, looked in the Health care box of links, but couldn't find anything relevant. Then they used site search, and found the [Annual Income Limits table](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/annual_income_limits_health_benefits.asp).
- 1 participant who found the [Annual Income Limits table](https://www.va.gov/healthbenefits/annual_income_limits_health_benefits.asp) said that they would contact an attorney to find out which group they're in.
> *"Better to ask a professional, rather than spin your wheels" (p1)*.
