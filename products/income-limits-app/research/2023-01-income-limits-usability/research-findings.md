## Research Goals
The new Income Limits application enables Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to **look up the income limits for VA health care benefits** by answering several questions.

There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) when they might want to know whether they may be eligible for VA health care with their current income:
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Attending to health needs)
- Taking care of myself (Recognizing and addressing mental health needs, Managing primary care and chronic health issues, Seeking support for an acute health event, Maintaining my health)
- Retiring (Taking care of my health)
- Aging (Managing my declining health)

The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the newly redesigned income limits application**. Learnings will help refine the design of the application before launch.

## Research Questions
1. What are Veterans' expectations of income eligibility for VA health care? (ask before showing app)
1. Where do Veterans expect to find this app? (i.e., Costs of Care page, Eligibility page, etc.)
1. Do Veterans understand the questions in the app? Is anything unclear or confusing?
1. Do Veterans find a summary page helpful for verifying the information entered?
1. Do Veterans understand the income limits presented in the app results page?  Is anything unclear or confusing?
1. Do Veterans understand the relevant year of income for their eligibility? 
1. Do Veterans understand the health care benefits shown in the app results page?  Is anything unclear or confusing?
1. How far do Veterans scroll down the app results page?
1. Do Veterans understand deductions and how that affects their income? (Did they see the details about this?)
1. After seeing the information presented in the app results page, what do Veterans want to do next? 
1. Do Veterans understand that they can use this to find the income limits for a previous year (not 2023)? Reaction to it not being part of the flow?


## Methodology 
We will conduct **usability testing** to guide research participants through a click-through prototype. Sessions will be conducted over Zoom.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. Veterans will be able to answer the questions in the app for themselves.
2. From the information presented in the app results page, Veterans will understand how the different income thresholds affect the health care benefits they might qualify for, including if their income is higher than all of the thresholds.
3. Zip code is sufficient/comfortable for Veterans to specify the location where they live.
4. After seeing the summary page with information entered, Veterans will have confidence in the accuracy of the results page.
5. Veterans understand the difference between the desired year for benefits and the year that they need to use for income (the previous year).
6. Veterans understand that thresholds in the app are not final answers, and only by applying for VA health care can they learn what benefits they're eligible for.
7. Veterans don't need to see their answers to the questions while looking at the results page (i.e., having answers only on the review page is enough). 
8. The results page is an intuitive place for Veterans to seek information about historical income limits (vs. earlier in the interaction flow).
9. The intro page communicates that income limits apply to only some Veterans.

### All participants understood the purpose of the app and found it easy to use
- All participants understood what the app was for--to find out if they might be eligible for VA health care based on their income before applying.
> *"Figure out even if I'm eligible by income before I continue on to do further research" (p8)*.
> *"See if I qualify or not based on income" (p9)*.
- All participants found it **easy to answer the questions**, which were posed one question at a time (the subtask design pattern). A few participants commented that it was really easy to answer the questions on their phone. 
- All participants **used the *Continue* button without any hesitation**, and some used the *Back* button, too (others didn't need to).
- All participants **understood the income ranges** and figured out which one to open. One participant did say that they expected to have ranges with even thousands of dollars (i.e., _$82,000 - $89,999, $90,000 or more_ instead of _$81,900 - $90,089, $90,090 or more_).
> *"Not a lot of reading, not a lot of choices...As your income goes down, the more benefits you would receive" (p7)*.

- Once they found the "Get past income limits" link, participants didn't have any difficulties doing the **Past Income limits task**.

### There were a few navigation issues within the app


### Participants had difficulty understanding some of the benefit descriptions under the income ranges
Participants found some of the text to be ambiguous, which made it difficult for them to understand the specific benefits and compare them across income ranges. Each of the phrases below was questioned by 3 of 8 participants (but not the same participants for each): 
- **"VA health care"**--medical? dental? vision? only at a VA hospital?
- **"most types of care"**--outpatient office visits for routine appointments and for illness? lab work and screenings? inpatient care? surgery? dental? vision? for dependents, too?
- **"copays" *vs.* "full copays"**--dollar amounts? how much for surgery and is there a limit? 

> *"I don't understand. I would have to ask someone or look it up" (p8)*

- RECOMMENDATION: Add more description to the benefits and/or provide links to details for "VA health care", "most types of care", "copays", and "full copays".
- RECOMMENDATION: Consider standardizing the bullets for each benefit so it's easier to compare them across income ranges: 
  - Outpatient and inpatient visits
  - Prescriptions
  - Travel pay (if applicable)

### Participants had some confusion with terminology used in the questions, including the word "dependents"
3 of 8 participants didn't know what **"Aid and Attendance benefits"** were but assumed that they didn't have it.
1 participant didn't know what **"Housebound allowance"** meant, but assumed they didn't have it.
In the question *Did you get a VA pension from VBA last year?*, 1 participant didn't know what **"VBA"** meant and said that they felt embarrassed about it and also distracted from the task at hand.

> *"I get embarrassed when I don’t know what things mean when they are asked. It also makes me start questioning if I should be receiving these other things, and it gets me off track. Makes me want to look into those things." (p7)*

Participants had different interpretations for the **dependents** question. Some said they would enter what they put on their income taxes, and others remembered this information incorrectly or might have been thinking of the VA's definition of dependents, which includes your spouse.
- Half of the participants entered what they put on their income taxes, though one said that he'd ask his wife what that was because she does their taxes. 
- Two participants wanted to enter 1 for their wife, with whom they file taxes jointly.
- One participant entered 2 for his grown kids, which are likely not dependents in the income tax sense.
- One participant wanted to enter 1 for himself. Was he maybe thinking of income tax exemptions?

- RECOMMENDATION: Clarify the meaning of "dependents" in this question per income taxes or VA rules, and add details to the question so people know how to answer. According to a VA subject-matter expert (in an email dated 4/17/2023), dependents include *your spouse*, unmarried children under 18 (or 18-23 if attending school full-time or disabled prior to reaching age 18), and parents if in the Veteran's direct care and whose net worth and income are below a fixed limit.
- RECOMMENDATION: Delete the text "from VBA" in the pension question (or if this must be kept in, write out "Veterans Beefits Administration") because it's confusing as is.
- RECOMMENDATION: Add more description to the "Aid and Attendance" and "Housebound allowance" pages and/or provide links to details because some Veterans don't know what they mean.

### The landing page was very long to read on a phone, and participants found it difficult to find one of the two "Check our current income limits" links 
The **landing page** in the prototype was a static version of the [Your health care costs page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/) on which the only working links were two copies of "Check our current income limits". When the participant clicked on one of those two links, they saw the prototype screens for the income limits tool.

Scrolling down this very long landing page on a phone took a while, especially for the 3 participants who were reading everything on that page. The two income limits links were several scroll distances down the page, and there was more to the page below these links. 
- 2 participants seemed lost in the long page while scrolling. 
- 1 participant never found either of the income limits links. 
- Another participant found one of them but continued reading down the page, and when they scrolled back up, they had trouble finding the link again. 
- 2 other participants missed both links on their first look through the page but found one later. 
- 6 participants clicked on the first income limits link (in the section "Will I need to pay for any of my care, tests or medications?").
- Only 1 participant clicked on the second income limits link (in the section "Does VA verify the information I provide?"), and they remarked:
> *"Kind of far down on the page" (p9).*

- RECOMMENDATION: Consider restructuring the content on the [Your health care costs page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/) page to put all income limits info closer together and move the income limits app link closer to the top of page.

### Participants used the salary numbers provided by the moderator to decide which income limit accordion to open on the results page, and most didn't mention their household income or deductions

Most participants (7 of 8) **didn't open the "How to estimate your income for this tool" accordion**, which describes household income and deductions that may apply. Two of them later opened it during the past limits task.
3 participants said they expected to use the AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) number from last year's income taxes, assuming household income but no additional deductions. 

> *"I automatically went to the numbers" (p6)*.

- RECOMMENDATION: Be more explicit about household income and deductions on the results page, without needing to open any accordions. For example, consider changing the first sentence from "We use your last year's income to determine..." to "We use your last year's _household_ income _minus deductions (such as out-of-pocket medical expenses, education costs, and funeral/burial expenses for a spouse or child)_ to determine..."



### Many participants said that they may not be eligible for VA health care, based on what they read on the landing page
, the app intro page, or the app results page

#### From landing page
> *"From what I read I would not be able to receive healthcare unless I have a disability" (p7)*.
 
- RECOMMENDATION: Consider clarifying in the content on the [Your health care costs page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/) page that if your income is too high, applying for disability may not be what you should do next.

**FROM TOPLINE...**

6. Some participants were **confused by the mention of cases where income limits don't apply**, wondered whether income limits applied to them, and thought the app might help them figure this out. 
11. Most participants believed the results they got from the app and **weren't inclined to apply for health care** if their income was in the highest bracket.
12. Some participants had **difficulty navigating back to the _Review information_ page** from the _Results page_.

## Additional Insights

_Any additional insights that aren't "key findings." These can be powerful comments from users that don’t represent a pattern in this study, but may be part of one outside this study._

We heard **additional feedback on the app intro page from individual participants**. Each of the comments below is from only one participant, but could be used to potentially tweak the content copy on the page.
- Based on the first sentence ("You may be eligible for VA health care based on your VA disability rating, service history, or other factors"), 1 participant **expected to be asked about their disability rating and service history**, but those are actually reasons that you would NOT need the app.
  - RECOMMENDATION: Lead with a clearer distinction between income limits and what factors make them relevant or not (e.g., "_Not everyone is affected by income limits._ You may be _automatically_ eligible for VA health care based on your VA disability rating, service history, or other factors. If you're not eligible based on these factors, you may still qualify if your income is within our limit.")

- 1 participant was **concerned about how long this income limits app will take to go through** because they'll probably need to create a password and gather a lot of documents (e.g., investments, W2s, DD214). After going through the app pages, this participant was relieved.
>  *"Wasn't overwhelming with requiring a ton of info, such as finding a DD214, and creating a new password. It was quick. that's important" (p7)*.
- RECOMMENDATION: Add to the intro page how long to expect and what's needed so people know it's quick and easy (e.g., "Here’s what you’ll need to apply: your household income and number of dependents from the last year...", "It should take about 3 minutes."
  
- 1 participant who had a cognitive disability said that the block of **text was too much to read and understand**. There are already 
> *"Too much text and not enough separation [formatting-wise] of it. Want a tldr" (p1)*.
