## Research Goals
The new Income Limits application enables Veterans, their caregivers, family members, and others to **look up the income limits for VA health care benefits** by answering several questions.

There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) when they might want to know whether they may be eligible for VA health care with their current income:
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Attending to health needs)
- Taking care of myself (Recognizing and addressing mental health needs, Managing primary care and chronic health issues, Seeking support for an acute health event, Maintaining my health)
- Retiring (Taking care of my health)
- Aging (Managing my declining health)

The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the newly redesigned income limits application**. Learnings will help refine the design of the application before launch.

## Research Questions
1. What are Veterans' expectations of income eligibility for VA health care? (ask before showing app)
1. Where do Veterans expect to find this app? (i.e., Costs of Care page, Eligibility page, etc.)
1. Do Veterans understand the questions in the app? Is anything unclear or confusing?
1. Do Veterans find a summary page helpful for verifying the information entered?
1. Do Veterans understand the income limits presented in the app results page?  Is anything unclear or confusing?
1. Do Veterans understand the relevant year of income for their eligibility? 
1. Do Veterans understand the health care benefits shown in the app results page?  Is anything unclear or confusing?
1. How far do Veterans scroll down the app results page?
1. Do Veterans understand deductions and how that affects their income? (Did they see the details about this?)
1. After seeing the information presented in the app results page, what do Veterans want to do next? 
1. Do Veterans understand that they can use this to find the income limits for a previous year (not 2023)? Reaction to it not being part of the flow?


## Methodology 
We will conduct **usability testing** to guide research participants through a click-through prototype. Sessions will be conducted over Zoom.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. Veterans will be able to answer the questions in the app for themselves.
2. From the information presented in the app results page, Veterans will understand how the different income thresholds affect the health care benefits they might qualify for, including if their income is higher than all of the thresholds.
3. Zip code is sufficient/comfortable for Veterans to specify the location where they live.
4. After seeing the summary page with information entered, Veterans will have confidence in the accuracy of the results page.
5. Veterans understand the difference between the desired year for benefits and the year that they need to use for income (the previous year).
6. Veterans understand that thresholds in the app are not final answers, and only by applying for VA health care can they learn what benefits they're eligible for.
7. Veterans don't need to see their answers to the questions while looking at the results page (i.e., having answers only on the review page is enough). 
8. The results page is an intuitive place for Veterans to seek information about historical income limits (vs. earlier in the interaction flow).
9. The intro page communicates that income limits apply to only some Veterans.

### Participants had difficulty understanding some of the benefit descriptions under the income ranges
Participants found some of the text to be ambiguous, which made it difficult for them to understand the specific benefits and compare them across income ranges. Each of the phrases below was questioned by 3 of 8 participants (but not the same participants for each): 
- **"VA health care"**--medical? dental? vision? only at a VA hospital?
- **"most types of care"**--outpatient office visits for routine appointments and for illness? lab work and screenings? inpatient care? surgery? dental? vision? for dependents, too?
- **"copays" *vs.* "full copays"**--dollar amounts? how much for surgery and is there a limit? 

> *"I don't understand. I would have to ask someone or look it up" (p8)*

- REC: Add more description to the benefits and/or provide links to details for "VA health care", "most types of care", "copays", and "full copays".
- REC (move to other section): Consider standardizing the bullets for each benefit so it's easier to compare them across income ranges: 
  - Outpatient and inpatient visits
  - Prescriptions
  - Travel pay (if applicable)

### Participants had some confusion with terminology used in the questions
3 of 8 participants didn't know what **"Aid and Attendance benefits"** were but assumed that they didn't have it.
1 participant didn't know what **"Housebound allowance"** meant, but assumed they didn't have it.
In the question *Did you get a VA pension from VBA last year?*, 1 participant didn't know what **"VBA"** meant and said that they felt embarrassed about it and also distracted from the task at hand.

> *"I get embarrassed when I don’t know what things mean when they are asked. It also makes me start questioning if I should be receiving these other things, and it gets me off track. Makes me want to look into those things." (p7)*

Participants had different interpretations for the **dependents** question.
Some said they would enter what they put on their income taxes, and others remembered this information incorrectly or might have been thinking of the VA's definition of dependents, which may include your spouse and others who live with you.
- Half of the participants entered what they put on their income taxes, though one said that he'd ask his wife what that was because she does their taxes. 
- Two participants wanted to enter 1 for their wife, with whom they file taxes jointly.
- One participant entered 2 for his grown kids, which are likely not dependents in the income tax sense.
- One participant wanted to enter 1 for himself. Was he maybe thinking of income tax exemptions?

- REC: Clarify the meaning of "dependents" in this question per the IRS income tax sense or VA, and add details to the question so people know how to answer.
- REC: Delete the text "from VBA" in the pension question (or if this must be kept in, write out "Veterans Beefits Administration") because it's confusing as is.
- REC: Add more description to the "Aid and Attendance" and "Housebound allowance" pages and/or provide links to details because some Veterans don't know what they mean.

**FROM TOPLINE...**
### Usability Successes
1. All participants **understood the purpose of the app**--to find out if they might be eligible for VA health care based on their income before applying.
2. All participants found it **easy to answer the questions**, which were posed one question at a time (the subtask design pattern). A few participants commented that it was really easy to answer the questions on their phone. 
3. All participants **used the *Continue* button without any hesitation**, and some used the *Back* button, too (others didn't need to).
4. All participants **understood the income ranges** and figured out which one to open.
5. Once they found the "Get past income limits" link, participants didn't have any difficulties doing the **Past Income limits task**.

### Usability Issues
6. Participants found the **landing page** in the prototype ([Your health care costs](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/)) to be **very long**--especially on a phone--and it was **difficult to locate the "Check our current income limits" link** in it (which was in two places).
6. Some participants were **confused by the mention of cases where income limits don't apply**, wondered whether income limits applied to them, and thought the app might help them figure this out. 

8. Most participants **didn't open the "How to estimate your income for this tool"** accordion and didn't mention any deductions. They simply used the salary number from the moderator to select an income range to open. 
11. Most participants believed the results they got from the app and **weren't inclined to apply for health care** if their income was in the highest bracket.
12. Some participants had **difficulty navigating back to the _Review information_ page** from the _Results page_.
