Participant 8
=============

Warm-up Questions
-----------------

> Can you tell me a little about yourself?

So, I served 11 years active duty in the Marine Corps followed by... I've been in the Reserves so far for two years. I've deployed twice to Afghanistan. I worked in air intelligence for a while on the flight line and heavy weapons. That's what led to my hearing loss for the most part. I work as a contractor for (omitted). I just do advisory work for the Air Force. Nice little office job. Got a wife and a two year old you might hear running around in the background. And a dog that acts more like a cat.

> Can you tell me about your hearing aids?

I have the, hold on a sec, the Resound brand hearing aids and actually I originally had one that I needed to replace the batteries on every few days or so. Recently, I was able to switch to the rechargeable ones. It's the Linx Quatro. That made a huge difference in being able to not worry every single day about a battery dying in the middle of the day and did I remember to bring a spare battery to work.

> You got the rechargeable through the VA?

Correct

> Presumably with your old aids you ordered batteries and accessories through the VA?

I did, obviously I don't anymore. I have a small stock pile in case I ever need to revert to my old hearing aid for any reason.

> Do your rechargeable hearing aids have accessories?

Yes, there's the rubber flange that sits on the tip, and the wax guard.

> How do you get those?

I get those through the VA. I have also gotten them through the clinic on base.

> Methods used to order?

There was a phone number I called. Yeah, I'm 90% sure I called a phone number on the eBenefits site. That was what I used to reorder accessories.

> Do you remember what that experience was like?

It was fairly straightforward! No push back or anything like that. Tell them the model and accessories you need.

> Where would you go to order hearing aid supplies from the VA online?

As far as I'm aware, there isn't a site you can go to where you can enter information and have stuff sent to me. The last time I tried to do this, several months ago, there was no online submission option. It was just the phone number.

> How often do you place orders, including from physician?

Every few months. I try to be diligent about keeping my hearing aid cleaned and maintained so by doing that the wax guards don't usually get clogged up. It takes a longer period of time before I need to replace those. I wear the flanges until they are completely run down so I don't have to waste resources. If I can make it work by properly maintaining it myself then I don't want to waste resources

> Have you ever participated in usability testing before?

No, I have not. 

Task 1:[ VA.gov](http://va.gov)
-------------------------------

> Imagine youre interested in placing an order. Can you show me how you would place an order from this page?

I gotta sign in. *Signs in*

This seems like quadruple factor verification that you have to do every time and sometimes multiple times. 

*Clicks on VA Benefits and Health Care on top menu*

I think I would normally go to... there you go! Order hearing aid batteries and prosthetic socks.

> You don't have to do anything on this page. I'm going to share the link to the new prototype. 

Ordering from eBenefits was not an option before. It was just a phone number.

> I noticed that you hesitated on hovering over disability. Would you expect to find it under disability or find it where you expected?

I would think to find it under disability because it is one of my disabilities. Honestly, I think it should probably be listed under both so regardless of where people click instinctively they can find it.

Task 2: Content page 
---------------------

> Tell me what's jumping out at you on this page. 

*Participant slowly scrolls* This all makes sense on the first block *Referring to blue box* 

Great, you can order by clicking the link *Green button* It's nice and bold. This is the phone number I had to call before *referring to DLC phone number*. It's nice that for whatever reason somebody is not comfortable ordering them online that there are the phone and mail options for them. *scrolls down* Again, it points out that these are free of charge... these are all the things you can be resupplied with. I get the domes and wax guards. It's good to know that they provide you info on how long it will take and how long they will last. And what to do if the hearing aids break. This is a solid page

> Anything surprising or confusing?

No. It's good that the hearing aid supplies is towards the top of it. My normal instinct is why isn't it at the very top of the page, but you need to know if you're eligible to order it before you order it. If you click Order hearing aid supplies then you could have that block of information at the top of that page. It pops right out at you from the very beginning. Then when you try to do it, it will let you know on that page if you're eligible

> Which ordering method would you prefer?

The one I just mentioned. It puts order hearing aid supplies front and center.

> What do you expect to see when you click that button?

I would expect to see the 'Am I eligible' and probably... it would be better as... but a hover pop-up where you keep the cursor over the hyperlink and you move it away it disappears. That would be the 'Am I eligible to order hearing aid supplies' would appear. Then it would take you to a page where you fill out your name, or actually you'd be logged in. If you're logged in then your personal info will be there. It'll give you an option to verify and then clicking what supplies you need to order and then like I said the hover button for 'Am I eligible to order' and then submit.

> Go ahead and show me what you'd do next to request the batteries

Since I am eligible, I'd click this link *referring to sign-in button* since I am comfortable with ordering things online.

Now I have to sign in... if I am signed in I don't want to have to sign in again. I have to sign in 9 million times and it's frustrating. And then when I click on this, my shipping address, email address, and hearing aid information should already be populated with my account. If it's not, that's something that needs to be fixed. That information should be on file so having to reenter it should be unnecessary. Confirming information stuff absolutely! And select what accessories you need, review and submit.

Be able to track it, okay. It shouldn't take 1-2 days to receive a confirmation email with a tracking number. My wife works in e-commerce and so I'm well aware of auto generated emails and the systems behind them. It should not take 1-2 days. You should be able to generate an email within minutes that says your order has been completed, here's your tracking number. What it could say is you'll receive another email in a day or two with your shipping information. Like, when I ship something through FedEx it'll say that your shipping label has been created but the thing has not been shipped out yet.

> Assuming you hadn't signed in and you were presented to sign in, what are your thoughts about being prompted to sign in once? 

That's fine. I'd rather sign in with DS Logon and have all my information populated than not sign on and manually input my information.

> You can move onto the next page.

*Clicks on the sign in button* 

Task 3: Sign in
---------------

*Participant signs in with info provided by the moderator*

Task 4: Form
------------

> Please proceed to use this form as you normally would if you were placing an order.

### Introduction page

*Scrolls down page slowly* Alright, yeah I like that the 'Order hearing aid batteries and accessories' is available at the top and very bottom so if you're comfortable with the process you can just click right away but if you're not as familiar with it, when you're done reading you can click it right there without scrolling back to the top of the page. 

*Clicks on primary green button*

### C1P1

Yes, confirm all that's good. *referring to personal info* Continue

*Selects 'Continue' button*

### C1P2

Yup, send my order to this address. Cool. And again it's nice to have that 7-10 business days reminder. Email address auto populated. So, is the purpose for re-entering email address for you to confirm it?

> Yeah

*Participant types email address again and selects 'Continue' button*

### C2P1

For this purpose, yes I need batteries. Yeah, so this is the one I have *referring to rechargeable hearing aids* but it's nice to know there's contact information if you're having issues with your aid.

*Selects the available hearing aid and selects 'Continue' button*

### C2P2

*Selects 'Yes, order accessories' button* No, I'm good on dry aid kit. Multi tool, cool I'll order one of those too. *Selects Multi tool item and selects 'Continue' button*

### Review screen

Now we're just reviewing, ability to edit if it's not right... got it... *scrolls down quickly*

> It's not smart enough to carry over your information

If it was doing this for real it would have the actual accessory names

*Select the 'Submit order' button*

### Confirmation screen

'Your order has been submitted', sweet! Letting me know again what I've ordered, confirmation number, yeah. So, how long will it take to receive my order... I think that 'We'll send you an email confirming your order to hector@gmail.com' is that email immediately coming or will that email come 1-2 days after?

> We will send it immediately.

Right, that was the clutch thing I mentioned earlier. Tracking number coming a couple days later is fine.

> What would you do after submitting this form?

I would anticipate a confirmation email, and then just wait 1-2 days for tracking number and 7-10 days to get my order.

> Anything missing?

*Rereads the contents out loud* No, this is good!

> What were your impressions of the overall process?

Very good. All the information auto-populating and just confirming it and knowing what aids I have so I didn't have to search through a list was very good.

> Anything to make it a better experience?

I think I mentioned one or two things early on about the 'Am I eligible' but aside from that I don't have any recommended improvements. 

Extra tasks
-----------

### Address screen

> Let's say you noticed a typo in your permanent address. How would you update that?

I'd just hit edit permanent address. Change anything and save. *Selects 'edit permanent address' link, scrolls down and selects 'Save permanent address' button*

> Is that what you'd expect?

Yeah

> Would you expect changing your address to happen everywhere?

Yes, I know it might be a pain in the butt because everything is centralized so that might be a feat for it to update system-wide because the VA wants to know what your true address is and to update any information like that I have to contact the VA directly via phone or something. If it's simple enough to edit it like this, I wouldn't expect to be able to. 

### Battery selection

> Select yes. If you were not able to locate your device, what would you do?

Click on 'What if I don't see my hearing aid?" *Clicks on additional info component* Yup, find your local VA medical center. Now, I would also like it if cuz again I'm already in the VA system, if it had my audiologist information on file so I wouldn't have to find contact information.

> Any more thoughts about this?

Nope! Just if it had my audiologist contact information.

### Accessories selection

> Continue, and select yes again. Now let's say if you don't find your accessories?

I would select 'What if I don't see the accessories i need' *Selects the additional info component* and I would call the phone number.

> Do you have any thoughts about this compared to the last screen?

This, it would be nice to possibly have a list you could search from.

> What do you mean?

So, uh... let's say there's the ability to search by your hearing aid all available accessories for it to see if it shows up there. If you still can't find it at that point then I would call and email.

### Review screen

> Let's say you want to add another accessory. Can you show me how you would do that?

I would hit edit right next to accessories *selects 'edit' button* and select accessory #2 that I need to add as well and update page *selects 'Update' button*. Scroll back up to confirm, now I have 1 & 2 and then I would complete my order. 

Follow-up Questions
-------------------

> How could this experience be improved for you? 

Uh, alright so to be completely honest with you I have short term memory loss. I know I gave you examples as we went along. At this point I don't remember what I said. Whatever it is I said that you recorded, that

> What technology do you use regularly?

My laptop, smart phone, Alexa in the home, smart TV, iPad, all those fun shenanigans.

> Do you use assistive technology besides hearing aids?

Nope

> Do you have challenges using computers or mobile devices?

No.

> After going through this process, would you use this ordering method?

Yes. I mean, again not having to wait on hold for someone to answer at the DLC or wait to get an email back confirming... basically you send an email and they have to manually review that information and you may have mistyped the hearing aid you have. They may respond back with either requesting clarification or they might send you the wrong supplies because you entered the wrong hearing aid. So, having something where it auto populates the available accessories and knowing what your hearing aid is already is ideal.
