Goals
=====

How might we make the online Medical Device Ordering Tool more accessible and user-friendly for all Veterans ordering hearing aid batteries and accessories?

How might we create an experience that motivates Veterans to transition from other ordering methods towards online ordering?

Background
==========

The Medical Device Ordering Tool is a migration and modernization of hearing aid battery ordering functionality that currently exists as an iframed applet on eBenefits; part of the modernization includes an added feature of ordering hearing aid accessories. With eBenefits being sunsetted and the DLC's interest in increasing adoption of online ordering to reduce contact center workload, we're tasked with designing a modernized online ordering experience that will be easier for Veterans to complete and less overhead for the DLC to process.

User Research Goal
==================

This study was meant to reveal both successes and pain points as Veterans navigate the new hearing aid batteries and accessories ordering flow using an interactive prototype.

-   Learn how Veterans navigate to the ordering tool's content page from the VA.gov homepage 

-   Uncover any gaps in the ordering tool's design based off Veterans' experience using the product

Hypotheses Tested 
==================

-   Veterans may struggle to locate the content page and form link

-   Veterans may not understand that adding accessories to their order happens after adding batteries

-   Veterans may have concerns about receiving an email notification after submitting an order

-   Veterans may want to print out the review submission screen to have a 'receipt' displaying their ordered items

-   Veterans may miss the 'add an email address for an order confirmation' component

Research Method: Task-based Usability Test 
===========================================

We chose to conduct a task-based usability test because we want to evaluate the design's intuitiveness as Veterans place orders for hearing aid batteries and accessories. We lead participants through various tasks using an interactive UXPin prototype that was populated with their relevant product information. Each remote session lasted approximately an hour. 

Who We Spoke With
=================

- 10 total participants (9 male, 1 female, ages from 30-75) who had all previously ordered hearing aid resupply items through the VA
   - 5 participants have ordered via phone
   - 3 participants have ordered via email
   - 2 participants have ordered via mail card 
   - 2 participants noted that they have also ordered via My HealtheVet secure messaging

- The participants represented a range of product needs
   - 5 participants stated they order both hearing aid batteries and accessories 
   - 2 participants only order batteries 
   - 2 participants use rechargeable hearing aids and only order hearing aid accessories
   - 1 participant did not provide their order information during the session

- Participants served in the following service branches: Navy, Air Force, Marines, and US Army

Topics Covered 
===============

-   What items participants order, how those items are ordered, and how often orders for those items are placed

-   How participants feel about their current ordering method, and how likely they would switch to the new tool after moving through the prototype

-   Where participants would expect to be able to order resupply items from the VA online 

-   How participants navigate to the existing VA.gov content page containing information about ordering hearing aid batteries and accessories

-   What participants think about needing to log in to place an order for resupply items 

-   Information participants found important or helpful on the redesigned content page

-   How intuitive the ordering flow is as participants navigated the interactive prototype

-   If participants recognize their eligible products when selecting batteries and accessories to reorder

-   What participants would do if they didn't see a device they needed to reorder, and how they feel about the corresponding content

-   How participants would update their shipping address 

-   How participants would edit the items they're ordering from the review screen 

-   Technology participants used regularly, and what devices they would use to place an order online

-   Challenges participants face while using technology, and any assistive technology that helps with those challenges

Research Questions
==================

-   Do Veterans understand that batteries and accessories will be ordered on separate pages?

-   Do Veterans understand selecting and deselecting the product cards?

-   Where do Veterans expect to find the order form on VA.gov?

-   Do Veterans know who they can contact with questions about their order?

-   Do Veterans feel confident about the steps after an order is placed?

-   Are there any gaps in the order process?

-   Do Veterans feel prepared when beginning the form?

-   Is the ordering process intuitive for Veterans?

-   Is it clear how to edit a prefilled address or add a new temporary address?

Key Takeaways

Key Takeaways In Depth
======================

**1.  Navigating from the VA.gov homepage to the ‘Order hearing aid batteries and accessories’ content page was challenging for many Veterans**
-  Most participants missed the mega-menu at the top of the page and scrolled down to the quick links section of the homepage

-  Multiple participants selected the 'Refill and Track Prescriptions' link in the 'Health care' card even if they didn't feel like it was the correct choice
   - Some participants who used this path discovered the ‘Order hearing aid batteries & accessories’ link on the left menu bar

-  Some participants’ first instinct was to sign into their account 

-  Multiple participants used VA.gov’s search functionality when they couldn’t find a relevant link on the homepage

-  Some participants thought the ordering page should exist under both 'Health care' and 'Disabilities'

**2. While Veterans noticed the different ordering methods available, some did not immediately notice the path to order online**

-  Some participants did not notice the ‘Sign in to order hearing aid batteries and accessories’ button

-  Some participants did not realize the ‘Sign in to order hearing aid batteries and accessories’ button was clickable

-  Once participants noticed the button, they understood that they needed to sign in to place an order online

**3.  Although Veterans expressed frustration with the login process, they said it was reasonable to require them to log in to place an order**

-  Participants commented that they were unsure how else they would place an order if they didn’t need to log in

-  Most participants noted they would log in with My HealtheVet or DS Logon

-  Some participants expressed frustration with the login process
   > "[Logging in] makes it so much more difficult. It’s easier to call in by phone."

**4.  Veterans understood the ‘Shipping address’ portion of the flow featuring VA.gov’s new interactive card design**

-  Most participants immediately noticed both the addresses and the purpose of the screen; one participant initially skipped over the addresses 

-  Participants understood the difference between ‘Permanent’ and ‘Temporary’ addresses

-  No participants experienced issues selecting or editing an address

-  Some participants thought address modifications should update globally while others did not

**5.  Contrary to our hypothesis, participants didn’t skip re-entering their email address on the ‘Shipping address’ screen**

-  Although adding an email address was optional, all the participants re-entered the provided email address

**6. While Veterans successfully used the new checkbox button functionality, some participants experienced other challenges with the product selection process**

-  Some participants did not recognize their product names on both the batteries and accessories selection screens 

-  One participant who was ineligible to reorder batteries expressed interest in pre-ordering so she wouldn’t need to log in at a later date

-  One participant who was not eligible to add accessories to their order thought that meant they also couldn't order batteries

-  Some participants who do not order accessories easily moved onto the ‘Review order’ screen

**7. Veterans easily found the additional info component when asked what they would do if they didn’t see a product they needed; however, several felt the content inside was lacking**

-  Multiple participants expressed that it would be difficult to contact their audiologist

-  Many participants wondered why their audiologist’s contact information couldn’t be displayed since they were already logged in

-  Some participants did not mind needing to contact their audiologist

-  Participants inferred that the ‘Locate your audiologist’ link would take them to their audiologist’s contact information 

**8.  Although Veterans understood the ‘Review order’ screen’s purpose, many were confused by specific sections of the screen**

-  Participants were confused about whether or not they were adding batteries and accessories or confirming their previously selected items 
   - This was due to the ‘Add batteries to your order’ and ‘Add accessories to your order’ titles 

-  When participants were prompted to edit their selected accessories, some participants submitted their order instead of selecting the ‘Update’ button

**9.  Veterans clearly understood the ‘Confirmation screen’ once submitting an order**

**10.  Although some Veterans expressed challenges using technology, a majority said they would use the new online ordering system** 

-  6 participants said they would use this tool to place their orders

-  5 participants said they would use their desktop or laptop computer to place orders
   > "If I’m doing anything 'official', I do it on my desktop."

-  2 participants said they would use the online ordering tool if they didn’t need to log in multiple times

-  1 participant said it would be easier to just continue sending emails to the DLC when they needed to order resupply items

Recommendations
===============

-   Work with VA.gov's IA team to determine where MDT's new content page should live based on Veterans' behavior navigating to the existing content page 

-   Iterate on the MDT's content page design to make the online ordering method more prominent

-   Collaborate with frontend engineers and/or VA.gov's platform team to work around the 'Review page''s limitations in order to make the batteries and accessories sections clearer 

-   Iterate on the product selection screens to make it more understandable that Veterans are able to order batteries even if they aren't eligible for accessories and vice versa

-   New information about limitations in the form system and the DLC's data coincided with usability testing and need to be incorporated into the product selection screens

-   Iterate on the 'Additional info' components on the product selection pages to make the content more helpful and consistent

-   Reach out to the DLC to determine if the audiologist's contact information can be displayed in the 'Additional info' components to eliminate Veterans from having to exit the ordering form
