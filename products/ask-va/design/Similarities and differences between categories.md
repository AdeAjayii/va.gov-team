# Similarities and differences between categories

Last updated by @tygindraux: October 24, 2023

This document summarizes patterns in the design of the Ask VA form by calling out similarities and differences between categories. It's intended to be helpful for our engineers as they start building.

## Key categories to reference

There are a certain categories which we think are a good example of a "type" of category. These can be used as a reference when building categories the same or similar to it.

If we say that a category is the "same" as another, an exception to their sameness will always be the names of the category, topic and subtopics (review [label names](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/Category%2C%20topic%20and%20subtopic%20labels.md)).

### `Life insurance` aka The Vanilla Flow üç¶

The `Life insurance` category is a good example of what we've referred to as "a vanilla flow." It's straightforward, with few conditionals, and many other categories mimic (or build on) it. This category has consistent [contact options](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/List%20of%20contact%20options.md) (email, phone and US Mail are all always `ENABLED`) which makes the contact information section simple.

You can see how this category works here:
- [Design requirements: Life insurance](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1695423328470/f9c5091530a62f5966b628c21cb9b85ace70d62a?sender=u65f0a75fc7c68f2a5a2a9545).

### `Health care` aka Spaghetti and Meatballs üçù

The `Health care` category at it's core is similar to The Vanilla Flow, but it's much more complex. Some of the added complexity includes:
- it includes the [Search Facility: VA Medical Center]
- it's [contact options](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/design/List%20of%20contact%20options.md) differ greatly by topic
- sometimes it includes the Veteran's [Zip code], even if the submitter isn't being contacted by US Mail
