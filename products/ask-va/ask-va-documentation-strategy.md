# Ask VA documentation strategy

This strategy offers guidelines, not hard-and-fast rules, on where Ask VA integration team documentation lives. We aim to align internally on when and where to work and store documents. 
Our goal is to work in the open as much as possible to foster knowledge transfer across VA, OCTO, and the public. 
We also recognize there will be situations where it won’t be appropriate to share sensitive information ([outlined in the VA platform guidelines](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/sensitive-documentation-guidance)).

Our plan to test this strategy: 
- October 2023 - Meet as a team and make adjustments as needed
- October to December 2023 - Moving forward, the team starts following the strategy
  - Create tickets for Engineering, Design, and Product to review current documentation and move files around as needed
- January 2024 - Meet as a team during Jan 9 retro on first three months of using the strategy
<br>

We’ll follow this strategy by: 
- Referring to this document if we’re unsure of where a document should go
- Asking questions in one of our Ask VA Slack channels if we’re unsure of where a document should go
- Moving documents if you see something’s in the wrong place and notifying the file owner
  - Especially if the document has sensitive information (outlined in the VA platform guidelines)
<br>

Before creating any file, ask yourself: 
- Does this need frequent collaboration with:
  - Internally (just the Integration team)? 
  - The CRM and/or Infrastructure team? 
  - VA staff outside of OCTO?
- Do I need to move this file to another place after it’s “done”?
- When is my file “done”?
<br>

Here are some document clean-up examples by the team:
- Engineering: 
  - Move to GitHub: [VA Profile Spike](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3wGzMXjk3XrWHAS5bnKg9T2-syh1e1X/edit) This document is mostly done and needs minimal collaboration/editing in the future. Added [Moved] to the title. Add a link to the new document in the body of the doc.
  - Keep in Google: [AVA CRM Kick-Off Session Planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PPRaGpaPrmRLDnrE069OyoymAvjhwpULM0Ai-co4k0A/edit#heading=h.hi8e1lkv568e) This document contains general notes and isn’t updated anymore.
- Design: 
  - Move to GitHub: [Medallia surveys](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1obesi4mtVzXclviFWoIthaxZ-xw0PAmV8FznBlAXMgI/edit#heading=h.whd3wlz79wnb): This document is mostly done and needs minimal collaboration/editing in the future.

Key takeaways from this are summarized already in the [Phase 1 MVP- Front-End Redesign](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/Phase%201%20MVP%3A%20Must%20Have%20%2B%20Nice%20to%20Have.md#phase-1-mvp---front-end-redesign) doc in GitHub.
