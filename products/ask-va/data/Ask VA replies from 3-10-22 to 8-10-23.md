# Ask VA replies from 3-10-22 to 8-10-23
Last updated: 8/10/23

## Overview
After a person submits an inquiry through the Ask VA form, they may be able to reply to their inquiry. They can reply as an unauthenticated or authenticated user. 
The VA business line who manages the queue that inquiries are linked to can enable or diable replies to their inquries.

We wanted to understand the volume of replies coming through the AVA system. We're still investigating open questions we have about the data we pulled from the CRM system that the AVA form is connected to.

## Key takeaways
- Inquiries in the `Education` category have the most replies.
- "Business" inquiries are concentrated in `Education`, `Compensation`, and `Veterans Affairs - Debt`.

## Current open questions
- Are the Business or Personal authentication levels for unauthenticated or authenticated submitters or both?
- What is the # of inquiries from 3/10/22 to 8/10/23 that allow replies (so we can understand % of inquires that received a reply)?
- Why are there unauthenticated replies for the categories that only allow authenticated submitters (Education and Debt)?

## Notes on the data
The data excludes replies: 
  - Outside of the reply period
  - Where the inquiry number in the subject line doesn't match one in CRM
  - To categories that don't allow replies
    
The data includes replies:
  - From the AVA system
  - From submitters where replies are enabled or inside the reply period
