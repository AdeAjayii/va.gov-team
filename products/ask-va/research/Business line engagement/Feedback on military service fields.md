## When business lines say they need or don't need military service information

This is when business lines ([review list of stakeholders](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/List%20of%20stakeholders%20by%20category.md)) have stated they need or don't need military service information in Ask VA.

This list is alphabetized by category name. Each field is marked as:

- NEED - Business lines need this information to answer an inquiry. It is a required field.
- DON'T NEED - Business lines don't need this information to answer an inquiry.  It is hidden from the form, but the field still exists in the back-end.
- "Optional" - When given a choice between NEED and [DON'T NEED], business lines entered "Optional." This indicates they don't need the information, but it might be nice to have. Because we want don't want to collect unnecessary data from submitters, we considered "Optional" answers as [DON'T NEED].

## Final recommendations on military service fields

### `First name` and `Last name` 

**These fields will not change.** They will be required.

### `Date of birth`

**This field will not change.** It will be required, **unless**:
- `Who are you asking a question for?` = `A general question`
- and/or `Category` or `topic` = `Education benefits and work study`

### `Social security number` and `Service number`

**For the most part, these fields will not change.** Social security number will still be required, **unless**:

- `Who are you asking a question for?` = `A general question`
- and/or `Category` or `topic` = `Education benefits and work study`

When `Social security number` is required, we will let submitters opt out if they or their Veteran do not have a `Social security number`. In that case, we will ask for their `Service number`. This will remain optional, in case they do not have either.

### `Service start date` and `Service end date`

**These fields will be removed.** These fields were [indicated as unnecessary by business lines]((https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/List%20of%20military%20service%20fields.md#when-business-lines-say-they-need-or-dont-need-military-service-information)).

### `Claim number`

**This field will be removed.** This field was [indicated as unnecessary by business lines]((https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/List%20of%20military%20service%20fields.md#when-business-lines-say-they-need-or-dont-need-military-service-information)).

### `DoD/EDIPI number`

Although business lines had differing needs for `DoD/EDIPI`, we think this field should be **removed** because agents can look this up in MPI using a Veteran's first and last name, DOB and SSN, which will be required.

### `Branch of service`

**This field will change.** Previously, when military fields were present, `Branch of service` was always optional.

However, there are certain business lines that need to know `Branch of service` for their category:
  - `Veteran ID Card (VIC)`
  - `Disability compensation` (including when `Disability compensation` is a topic under `Benefits issues outside the U.S.`)
  - `Survivor benefits`
  - `Burials and memorials`
  - `Center for Women Veterans`

By making this field required when business lines say they need it, our hypothesis is that agents will more often have the information they need to reply to a submitter in the first instance. And by removing this field when business lines say they don’t need it, we minimize the need for submitters to enter unnecessary information.

If an inquiry is re-routed to one of these business lines from a business line that does not include `Branch of service`, they will be missing this information. But, we don’t believe that including this field as optional solves the problem. There’s still a likelihood that submitters:
- do not fill out the field, when it’s needed
- fill out the field, when it’s not needed

If there is missing information in these outstanding cases, business lines should reach out to the submitter and ask for the Veteran's `Branch of service` if needed.
