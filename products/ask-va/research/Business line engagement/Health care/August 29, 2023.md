## Key takeaways

- `Tell us the reason you're contacting us?`: Teams present on the call generally don't use this.
> "I haven't noticed it before."

- `How should we get in touch with you?`: Most teams follow up via email. The medical centers are required to call regardless of the answer to this question though.
> "Everyone gets a phone call [from medical centers] unless there's a behavioral flag that there cannot be contact."

- `Veteran's Gender*`: Teams on the call had no comment on this field, except one who answered "No."

- Military service fields: Teams noted they could look up other fields for the most part as long as they had specific fields.
> "If we have name, DOB, SSN, then we can find everything we need if it's in their record."
> "Sometimes we might reach out to the eligibility department for the start or end date. Or we might follow up. It isn't completely necessary."

- We skipped some topics because the team wasn't present.
- The ECM team noted that "Health care" needs to be included in the eligibility topic. It currently has "Health care" in the topic, and they still get inquiries on non-health care eligibility questions.
> "We need to keep this consistent because older Veterans for example might get confused by the end of the form."
