# HEALTH CARE Write Up

### Submitted by: Michael Bingham on May 2, 2022

We are requesting the following from you (in the form of a Word document or email) so that we can begin to workshop a reference document for agents to assist in correctly routing.

#### 1. Provide any point(s) of contact who are responsible for process documentation and/or are subject matter experts in terms of routing and queues for your LoB:

- Timothy Lavery

#### 2. Provide a list of most common correctly routed topics in the form of submitter questions (submitter questions you are able to answer)
- All questions related to the VA Civilian Health and Medical Program (CHAMPVA) and CHAMPVA In-House Treatment Initiative (CITI).

#### 3. Provide a list of items that seem like they would belong to your LoB, but don’t (submitter questions you cannot answer). Ex: DMC does not handle medical debt/ payments for medical services
- The Specialty Team in the Family Member Customer Experience Center does not handle:
  - Assisted Living (IE… in nursing home, or needs assisted living benefits)
  - Survivor Benefits
  - IT Issues (for example, but not limited to ID.me or MyHealtheVet issues)
  - Questions from providers regarding eligibility, benefits, claims status, or claims filing.
