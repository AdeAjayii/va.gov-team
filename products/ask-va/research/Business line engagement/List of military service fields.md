# List of military service fields

Last updated by @tygindraux: October 13, 2023

This list has been sourced from all business lines ([review list of stakeholders](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/List%20of%20stakeholders%20by%20category.md)). This is based on their needs, however, we still need to discuss how we design and build these fields. For example, whether we keep them consistent across all categories, or remove/add fields depending on a business line's needs.
