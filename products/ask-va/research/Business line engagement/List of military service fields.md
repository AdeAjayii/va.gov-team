# List of military service fields

Last updated by @tygindraux: October 13, 2023

This list has been sourced from all business lines ([review list of stakeholders](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/research/Business%20line%20engagement/List%20of%20stakeholders%20by%20category.md)). This is based on their needs, however, we still need to discuss how we design and build these fields. As examples, we could decide to keep them consistent across all categories but only make certain fields required, or, we could decide to remove/add fields depending on a business line's needs.

## When business lines need or don't need military service information

This is when business lines have stated they need or don't need particular military service information in Ask VA.

This list is alphabetized by category name.

### Analysis

Some fields are consistent across all categories:

- First/last name: Always `NEED`
- Date of Birth: Always `NEED`
- Service start date: Always `**DON'T NEED**`
- Service end date: Always `**DON'T NEED**`

Other fields are needed by some business lines, but not by others:

- Branch of service:
- Service number:
- SSN:
- DoD/EDIPI number:
- Claim number:
