*Ask VA Integration Team*

## Agenda

- Introductions
- Review AVA form fields
- Review category and topic names

## Attendees

- Our team: Tyler, Becky, Ruchi, Chante
- Survivor benefits team: Victor Breon Johnson
- NCA team: Jennifer Kelly
- CRM team: Jaime, Shelby
- Not present: Jennifer Reaser-Feuer, Angelita Taylor

## Key takeaways

- The responses to `Tell us the reason youâ€™re contacting us` aren't being used much by agents:
> "I don't think it's useful. We rarely receive compliments... Town hall is different. When we were having the town hall on a regular basis, we did see that. But in general this field doesn't really serve a big purpose. I haven't even looked at the data to see how often this is being used."
- We did not have time to finish reviewing the category and topic names for this category yet. We'll meet again on Thursday.
