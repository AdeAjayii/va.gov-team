## Key takeaways

- We agreed on this approach:
  - We will update the education/work study category name to `Education benefits and work study` once the CRM team is able to add a `Veteran Readiness & Employment` topic to this category.
  - Until we can add this VR&E topic, we will keep the chapter numbers in the education/work study category name.
- We shared initial designs with the GI Bill team, so they can see how category and topic selection will work for submitters. These are available to [view in Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1696283344891/247fee28f23a57d499875d68e21598f8b422590d?sender=u65f0a75fc7c68f2a5a2a9545).
