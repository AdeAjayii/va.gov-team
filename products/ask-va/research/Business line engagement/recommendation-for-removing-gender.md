# Recommendation for removing `Gender`
We recommendation removing the `Gender` field from the front-end Ask VA form after it moves to VA.gov. The [VA.gov Design System](https://design.va.gov/patterns/ask-users-for/gender) provides clear guidance to only ask for gender identity information if it benefits the user experience: 
> **Donâ€™t ask if it does not benefit the user experience.** You should only ask users about gender when absolutely necessary.

The Center for Women Veterans (CWV) team shared a [Federal law](https://www.govinfo.gov/app/details/PLAW-116publ315) as the reason why the Ask VA form must collect information from the `Gender` fields. However, the law has language that only mandates collection of gender information when gender information is available in the dataset:
> disaggregate such data by gender, race, and ethnicity, **when the data lends itself to such disaggregation**

The Ask VA form on VA.gov will also ask for preferred `Pronouns`, which serves a similar purpose to asking for gender identity: letting the agent who answers the inquiry know how to address who the inquiry is about and the submitter.

## Therefore, we do not need to collect gender identity information because: 
- **It does not benefit the user experience** - We will collect preferred `Pronouns`, which lets agents know how to address who the inquiry is about and the submitter.
- **It is not mandated by law** - Disaggregation by gender is only necessary if the data is collected in the first place.
