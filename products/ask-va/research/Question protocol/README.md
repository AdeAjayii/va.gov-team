# About this research

## Study
This is ongoing research with VA business lines. There is no associated issue in the [Research Repository](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/880).

## Background
Through meetings or structured interviews with different business lines using a WIP Sketch prototype, we can determine which fields are required in order for agents to deliver the service. This is often called a question protocol. We should also review the agent survey responses to learn more about what is and is not working.

This should also involve meeting with the CRM team to determine routing rules and limitations and reviewing the CRM team responses to our questions.

## Research Goals
* Understand which fields are necessary in order for agents to deliver the service
* Understand which fields are necessary in order to route queries to the right place

## Recruitment
We will meet with relevant business lines across VA as well as the Ask VA CRM team. 

## Date
This research is ongonig and will start in July 2023.
