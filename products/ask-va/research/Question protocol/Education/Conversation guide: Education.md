# Conversation Guide: EDUCATION BUSINESS LINE
*Ask VA Integration Team, June 2023*

Last updated by @tygindraux: July 24, 2023

## Research goal

Our goal is to **understand which fields are necessary in order for agents to deliver Ask VA (AVA)**. Our research questions are:

* How do agents answer an inquiry (step-by-step)?
* What makes it take longer to reply to a submitter?
* Which fields are required in order to answer a query?
* If an answer is required, what happens if a submitter enters something random in order to get through the form?
* How does this process differ across use cases (or categories and topics)?

## Notes to review ahead of time

* Most common correctly routed topics in the form of submitter questions (submitter questions you can answer):
  * Attached is a time record for processing
  * See attached time record and signed agreement
  * Time sheet for _____
  * Submitting Timecard for payment
  * Requesting a new Work-Study contract
  * New Application attached, please process
  * Requesting 30-day extension for student
  * Contract Extension request
  * Work Study Application
  * Signed Contract
  * Work-Study Supervisor changes
  * Work-Study site changes
  * Interested in Work-Study
  * Often times the Work-Study Site Supervisor submitting the student request will include the student’s name in the question section. 
* Items that seem like they would belong to your LoB, but don’t (submitter questions you cannot answer):
  * We see on occasion the following that require us to re-route to Muskogee CSR or Buffalo CSR.  These do not seem like they would belong to Work Study, but somewhere there is confusion, and we see OJT certifications.
  * Monthly Cert
  * OJT Cert
  * OJT Application
  * OJT hours for submission
  * On the other hand, there are times when the submitter selects “GI BILL” and “Post 9-11” when they should be requesting Work-Study. These then sit in the wrong queue and are not answered as timely as they could have been.
  * Additionally, for our CH31 recipients using Work Study benefits, sometimes documents are sent to VRE counselors instead of being correctly assigned to Work Study.

## Agenda - 60 minutes

* Intros: 5 minutes
* Review form fields: 15 minutes
* Review proposed names of category/topics: 20 minutes
* How you answer an inquiry: 10 minutes
* Show first design iteration: 5 mins
* Wrap up: 5 minutes

## Intros - 5 minutes

Thanks everyone for joining. Before we get started, I'm going to send our agenda in the chat.

> Send agenda.

I'm **[FACILITATOR]** and some of my colleagues are here too, **[RUCHI, THOMAS, BECKY, TYLER]**. Our team is working on moving the front-end of Ask VA to VA.gov. Today's a chance for us to learn more about how Ask VA works.

* I'd like to record this meeting for our notes. Is everyone okay with us recording?

> Start recording.

* Great. And before we jump in, can everyone on your team introduce themselves? Please share your name and your role.

> If the invite list is over 5 people from their team, skip everyone introducing themselves.

## Review form fields - 15 minutes

The first thing we're hoping to do is learn more about the fields that are currently in Ask VA. I'm going to share my screen.

> Share screen with spreadsheet.

There's a list of fields here in this first column. These are the fields that a submitter may see when they're filling out a new inquiry. We have questions about a few fields, which I've highlighted in orange.

> Go through list of questions we have.

## Review proposed names of category/topics - 20 minutes

The next thing I'd like to get your feedback on is the names of your category, topics and sub-topics.

We’ve reviewed the current names and made suggestions for how to update these so they're more consistent with content on VA.gov. This won't affect how the queries are routed to the correct queue.

> Go through list of names.

## How you answer an inquiry - 10 minutes

I'll stop sharing my screen now.

> Stop screen share.

We're going to switch gears a little now. I'd like to ask a few questions about how you answer inquiries.

* Can you walk us through the process of how an agent answers an inquiry (step-by-step)?
   * Is it possible to observe you answer an inquiry?
* What makes it easier to answer an inquiry?
* What makes it difficult?
* How long does it usually take you to reply to an inquiry?
    * Are you comfortable with us stating that it takes up to 7 business days to reply to an inquiry? 

## Show first design iteration - 5 mins

Thanks for answering all of our questions.

Before we wrap up, **[THOMAS]**, is going to show you a preview of the designs we've been working on. Just a reminder that this is the first version of these, so it's very likely that they'll change. But we wanted to give you an idea of what to expect.

> Share screen with Sketch prototype.

## Wrap up - 5 minutes

This was really helpful for our team.

* Before we finish, is there anything else you want to share with us?

Great, thanks very much for your time.
