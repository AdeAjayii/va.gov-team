# Conversation Guide - Business Line Interview: TEMPLATE
*Ask VA, June 2023*

Last updated by @tygindraux: June 28, 2023

## Background

Our goal is to **understand which fields are necessary in order for agents to deliver Ask VA (AVA)**. These are our research questions:

* Who uses the answers to each question in this form?
* What do they use the answers to each question for?
* Which fields are required in order to answer a query?
* If an answer is required, what happens if a user enters something random in order to get through the form?
* Why are optional questions part of the form?
* How does this process differ across use cases (or categories and topics), if at all?
* What makes it take longer to offer a response to the user?

## Prepare

### 1-2 days before the session

- [ ] Designate a facilitator and notetaker

### Day of the session
- [ ] Open the prototype and be ready to screen share

## Agenda - 60 minutes

* Set up: 5 minutes
* Background: 15 minutes
* Review form: 35 minutes
* Wrap up: 5 minutes

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining. Today is a chance for us to learn more about how Ask VA works. In particular, we'd like to understand how agents use each field in AVA in order to reply to an inquiry.

* Before we start, can everyone on your team introduce themselves? If you can share your name and your role, please.

## Background - 15 minutes

I'd like to start by learning about the type of inquiries you're responsible for.

* Which types of inquiries does your team answer?
* What makes it easier to answer an inquiry?
* What makes it more difficult? For example, what makes it take longer to answer a particular inquiry?
* *Any specific questions for this business line?*

### Review form: 35 minutes

Next, we're going to share our screen and ask for your feedback. This is an updated version of AVA that we've been working on.

#### Start page

This is the start page. We're going to imagine that someone starts by signing in. I'm going to skip ahead to the first page of the form now.

#### What is your question about?

I'd like to ask a couple questions about this screen now. On this screen, the user chooses a category, topic and sub-topic. This is very similar to the current AVA.

* In the current AVA system, how does your team use the category field to answer an inquiry?
* How does your team use the topic field to answer an inquiry?
* How does your team use the sub-topic field to answer an inquiry?
* *Any specific questions for this business line?*

#### What is your question?

On this screen, the user tells us more about their inquiry.

* When a users says they are a Veteran, dependent or submitting on behalf of a Veteran, how does that impact your response?
* We noticed that if someone says they are submitting a general question, they need to provide their zip code. Do you know why that is?
* Do you have any issues with the current free-text box, where users can write their inquiry in their own words?
* Do you let people upload documents when they submit an inquiry?
  * If yes, do you face any issues with this?
  * If not, could this be useful? How?
* *Any specific questions for this business line?*
