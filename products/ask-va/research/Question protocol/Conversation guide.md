# Conversation Guide - Business Line Interviews: TEMPLATE
*Ask VA, June 2023*

Last updated by @tygindraux: June 28, 2023

## Background

Our goal is to **understand which fields are necessary in order for agents to deliver Ask VA (AVA)**. These are our research questions:

* Who uses the answers to each question in this form?
* What do they use the answers to each question for?
* Which fields are required in order to answer a query?
* If an answer is required, what happens if a user enters something random in order to get through the form?
* Why are optional questions part of the form?
* How does this process differ across use cases (or categories and topics), if at all?
* What makes it take longer to offer a response to the user?

## Prepare

### 1-2 days before the session
- [ ] Make a copy of the conversation guide and replace 'Template' with the business line or category name
- [ ] Add questions relevant to the specific business line, if any
- [ ] Ensure prototype(s) are ready to go
- [ ] Designate a facilitator and notetaker

### Day of the session
- [ ] Open the prototype and be ready to screen share
- [ ] Open the conversation guide

### Starting the session
- [ ] Ask if everyone is okay with recording, and if so, start recording

## Agenda - 60 minutes

* Set up: 5 minutes
* Background: 15 minutes

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining. Today is a chance for us to learn more about how Ask VA works. In particular, we'd like to understand how agents use each field in AVA in order to reply to an inquiry.

* Before we start, can everyone on your team introduce themselves? If you can share your name and your role, please.

## Background - 15 minutes

I'd like to start by learning about the type of inquiries you're responsible for.

* Which types of inquiries does your team answer?
* What makes it easier to answer an inquiry?
* What makes it more difficult?
* *Any specific questions for this business line?*

### Review form: 35 minutes

Next, we're going to share our screen and ask for your feedback. This is an updated version of AVA that we've been working on.
