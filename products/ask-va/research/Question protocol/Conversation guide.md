# Conversation Guide: Business Line Interviews
*Ask VA, June 2023*

Last updated by @tygindraux: June 28, 2023

## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers, and supporting personnel in education, debt, loans, etc. to submit questions to VA and receive a secure message response. Currently, Ask VA (AVA) resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues.

We need to determine which fields are required in order for agents to deliver the service, which is often called a [question protocol](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/06/the-question-protocol-how-to-make-sure-every-form-field-is-necessary.php). In order to do this, we will meet with different business lines and share Sketch prototypes for feedback and discussion.

### Research questions

Understand which fields are necessary in order for agents to deliver the service:

* Who uses the answers to each question in this form?
* What do they use the answers to each question for?
* Which fields are required in order to answer a query?
* If an answer is required, what happens if a user enters something random in order to get through the form?
* Why are optional questions part of the form?
* How does this process differ across use cases (or categories and topics), if at all?
* What makes it take longer to offer a response to the user?
