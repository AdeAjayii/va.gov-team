# Conversation Guide - Business Line Interviews: TEMPLATE
*Ask VA, June 2023*

Last updated by @tygindraux: June 28, 2023

## Background

Our goal is to **understand which fields are necessary in order for agents to deliver Ask VA**. These are our research questions:

* Who uses the answers to each question in this form?
* What do they use the answers to each question for?
* Which fields are required in order to answer a query?
* If an answer is required, what happens if a user enters something random in order to get through the form?
* Why are optional questions part of the form?
* How does this process differ across use cases (or categories and topics), if at all?
* What makes it take longer to offer a response to the user?
