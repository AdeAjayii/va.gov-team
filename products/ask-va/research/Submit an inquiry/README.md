# About this research

## Study
This research has not started yet. There is no associated issue in the [Research Repository](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/880).

## Background
Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers, and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure message response. Currently, Ask VA (AVA) resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues.

Through moderated usability testing with submitters we will use high-fidelity Sketch prototype(s) to learn how they expect to answer questions, review an ongoing or past inquiry and get help if they encounter an issue. We will test on mobile.

## Research goals
* Understand how submitters expect to answer form fields and in which order
* Understand if submitters are clear when to authenticate and the benefits
* Understand how submitters expect to review an ongoing or past inquiry

## Recruitment
We will recruit through Perigean.

## Date
This research will take place in August 2023.
