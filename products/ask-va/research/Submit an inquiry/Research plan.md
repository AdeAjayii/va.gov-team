# Research plan for Ask VA: Submit an inquiry

Ask VA Integration Team, August 2023

Last updated by @tygindraux: August 25, 2023

## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/Ask-VA-MVP-1-Product-Outline.md) includes more details about our MVP scope.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO priorities:

* Solidify the VA.gov platform
* Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, caregivers and other submitters at all stages of the Veteran journey, from starting up to aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Review whether submitters can successfully submit an inquiry
* Review whether submitters have all the information they need when reviewing an ongoing or past inquiry

### Outcome

This research will help us determine if and how we need to improve the design and content of our MVP.

### Research questions

Review whether submitters can successfully submit an inquiry:

* Is it clear when you need to authenticate or when it’s optional?
* Are people missing information on any question, page or sequence of pages?
* Are there too many or too few fields per page?
* Are people likely to answer fields that are not required?
* Is it clear how much longer the form is?
* Do people understand how to edit their answers on the review page?
* How long do people expect it to take to submit an inquiry?
* What do people expect to happen right after they submit an inquiry?

Review what information submitters need when reviewing an ongoing or past inquiry:

* Are people missing any information that helps them identify which inquiry they're reviewing?
* How and how often do people expect to be updated about changes to their inquiry status?
* What do people expect to happen after they receive a response to their inquiry?

### Hypotheses

1. Most people will think authentication is required in order to ask any question, or, they will not understand that it’s required for specific types of fields.
2. Most people will find the form straightforward and intuitive.
3. Most people will choose to answer fields even if they are not required.
4. Most people will understand how long the form is and their progress.
5. Some people will be confused about which information they can edit on the review page and which they cannot.
6. Most people will expect an estimate of how long it will take to receive a reply.
7. Most people will prefer to receive email notifications when the status of their ongoing inquiry changes.
8. When reviewing an inquiry, most people will need to know the date they submitted, their question and its current status.
9. Once they receive a response from VA about their inquiry, some people will expect to reply back.
10. If people aren’t able to reply back to an inquiry, some people will submit a new inquiry to follow up.

## Methodology

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use a coded prototype in staging.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We’ll use Perigean to recruit participants. We will recruit Veterans and dependents.

## Future research

We have removed a few things that are out of scope for this study. In future research, we’d like to learn:

* Is it clear how information has been pre-populated from My VA Profile?
* How does the process differ for submitters who submit both personal and business queries, such as School Certifying Officials?
* How does the unauthenticated experience differ from the authenticated experience?

And we’d like to observe submitters:

* reply to an inquiry from their dashboard and their email
* look up an inquiry (from the start page) using their reference number
* go through the form using assistive technology
