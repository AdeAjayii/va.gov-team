# Research plan for Ask VA: Submit an inquiry

Ask VA Integration Team

Last updated by @tygindraux: August 25, 2023

## Background

Ask VA (AVA) is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers and others to submit questions to VA and receive a secure response. Currently, AVA resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

We need to move AVA to VA.gov. It should be mobile friendly, accessible and easy to submit an issue and receive updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ask-va/products/Ask-VA-MVP-1-Product-Outline.md) includes more details about our MVP scope.

### OCTO priorities

This research supports the following OCTO priorities:

* Solidify the VA.gov platform
* Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience

### Veteran journey

Ask VA can support Veterans, caregivers and other submitters at all stages of the Veteran journey, from starting up to aging.

## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Review whether submitters can successfully submit an inquiry
* Review whether submitters have the information they need when reviewing an ongoing or past inquiry

### Outcome

This research will help us determine if and how we need to improve the design and content of our MVP.

### Research questions

* Is it clear when you need to authenticate or when it’s optional?
* Are you missing information on any question, page or sequence of pages?
* Are there too many or too few fields per page?
* Do you understand how to edit their answers on the review page?
* Is it clear what to expect after you submit an inquiry?
* Are you missing any information to identify which inquiry you're reviewing?
* How and how often do you expect to be updated about changes to your inquiry status?
* What do you expect to happen after you receive a response to your inquiry?

### Hypotheses

1. Some people will think authentication is required in order to ask _any_ question.
2. Most people will find the form straightforward and intuitive.
3. Most people will understand how long the form is and their progress.
4. Some people will be confused about which information they can edit on the review page and which they cannot.
5. Most people will expect an estimate of how long it will take to receive a reply.
6. When reviewing an inquiry, most people will need to know the date they submitted, their question and its current status.
7. Most people will prefer to receive email notifications when the status of their ongoing inquiry changes.
8. Once they receive a response from VA about their inquiry, some people will expect to reply back.
9. If people aren’t able to reply back to an inquiry, some people will submit a new inquiry to follow up.

## Methodology

This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom. We will use a coded prototype in staging.
