## Transcript

Tyler: All right. So are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P6: Yes, I am.

Tyler: Well, thanks so much, P6. I see Jaime's here. So I'm going to admit Jaime to the meeting.

Tyler: And then, hi Jaime. Hopefully, you can hear us and maybe see us.

Tyler: Awesome. It looks like Jaime's joined us. Jaime, I'm just gonna have you go on mute and turn your camera off. We've just went through the consent process. So P6 and I are ready to get started. So thanks for joining.

Tyler: All right.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.400

Tyler: Okay, P6. So before we look at this prototype, I'm just gonna ask you a couple of questions just to get to know you a little bit better. How long have you been a veteran?

> P6: Well, so I'm still actually active duty. I got out in 2012 for a little while and came back in. And so I'm still. I'm still in. I'm just, I'm on terminal leave. I'm not on terminal leave. I'm sorry I'm on con leave. I had surgery on Friday. So yeah. Yeah. But I've contacted the VA for GI bill benefits and mental health reasons as well.

Tyler: Yeah, that's helpful. When you contacted the VA in the past. Did you call them? Or how did you get in touch with the VA.

> P6: So initially with the GI bill stuff through online, submitted everything to. I transferred my benefits to my spouse and then tried to contact them. And you know, on her behalf, essentially to streamline the process because it was taking a while to get that initiated with the I called for mental health reasons. But I had a direct number to a local VA center.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:56.730

> P6: When I was in upstate New York, and they got me taken care of like instantly. But I've also, you know, I've tried to call for GI bill benefits.

> P6: That can be quite the process.

Tyler: Yeah. When you say that can be quite the process. What do you mean by that?

> P6: Well, just being on it. They put you on hold, and you know it's a you do the prompt to who you want to speak to, and then you can be in the – what do they call it? You can be in the wait, you know, in the queue next, for you know, whoever who knows how long the time you can. The time can vary, just depending on what time of the day you call, if you call early, you know your likelihood of getting in quicker is much better. But if you try to call, you know, like most people during lunch, or whatever you're gonna you're gonna be on hold for a while. You know, I understand everybody has shortages, and the VA's no exception, you know.

Tyler: So yeah, well, it sounds like you had, you have different experiences like when you've gotten in touch directly with the VA in New York. That was like a little bit faster and maybe more urgent. And then, yeah. Calling on the phone can be a little bit more of a wait. Well, that's helpful background for me to understand. I'm sure we'll talk more about that as we go through the the session.

Tyler: I think, for now, though, we can go ahead and start looking at this prototype, so I mentioned that it's not gonna work perfectly. I'm gonna ask you to kinda like pause and not just like click around as as you like, because we might get confused with how the prototype works. So just bear with me with that. So I'm gonna send you a link in the chat on Zoom.

Tyler: This is always a little tricky on a phone, but we can definitely do it. So you should see a link pop up, and then if you click on that link and open it on your phone and then let me know when you see that on your phone.

> P6: Okay, I see.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So now we're gonna share your screen on Zoom. Have you done that before?

> P6: No... I'll see. So do I go back to zoom.

Tyler: Yeah. So you're going to go back to Zoom. Sorry I thought it was frozen.

Tyler: You're going to go back to the Zoom window where you can hopefully see my face.

Tyler: And then when you're on the Zoom window if you hover around, you'll be able to see some menu options.

> P6: Let's see.

Tyler: And it should say, share screen. I think it's a green button?

> P6: Yeah, I don't see it.

Tyler: You're not seeing it. Okay. Can you describe to me what you're seeing?

> P6: Yeah, so I can... And then, like, right now I see you so I can click. Let's see, touch the screen and up at the top. It tells me I can leave gives me a dropdown for zoom.

Tyler: Okay, maybe the drop down.

> P6: Hmm...

Tyler: Let's see what about the bottom. Do you see a menu at the bottom?

> P6: I see, share screen. There it goes. Bingo.

Tyler: Perfect. Then I'll let you know what I'm seeing. Okay, start broadcast. Great.

> P6: And then I need to go back and find that link?

Tyler: Exactly. Yeah, yeah, perfect. Yeah. And if you want to, you can keep my face there, or you can. I think you might be able to swipe it away. All right. Maybe if I turn my camera off... Awesome thanks for bearing with me. That part's always a little bit tricky.

Tyler: Okay, cool. So we're looking at this website, it says, ask the you can take a moment to just look around. We're not really gonna click on anything yet, and I'd love for you to just tell me what you're noticing first.

> P6: So timeliness. Right? I think that's a big thing, especially with Veterans and trying to get care. And I see that you should receive a response within 7 business days... You know, that's probably, to me, I think that's acceptable. But I know that a lot of people think that every problem that they have should be answered immediately. And that's probably going to throw up some red flags and irritate people with the 7 business days. But it, to me, I feel it's acceptable, you know. I just that's one thing that I see.

Natalie Morales: Is this exactly what someone sees the moment they go to the VA site?

> P6: Yeah, that's the first. So that is the second sentence. The first sentence says, get answers to your questions about VA benefits and services and upload documents online, and you should receive a response within 7 business days.

Natalie Morales: It should be introducing what Ask VA is first...

Tyler: Natalie. Sorry, I'm just gonna ask you to pause, and maybe we can save these questions for the end. Through the research session, I want to let P6 be able to share his thoughts first.

Natalie: Okay, no problem.

Tyler: Thanks. Alright, P6. So it sounds like you're you're seeing the 7 business days which we talked about. What is this service about?

> P6: It's about asking a question.

Tyler: It sounds like, maybe you're thinking about healthcare specifically, can you? What kinds of questions?

> P6: So I think that that's what it's telling me right when I look at this, because it's telling me to upload my documents to receive a response for VA benefits. So that's what I immediately think of, and I think, you know, for the most part I would. I would imagine most Veterans are probably coming to the VA for healthcare.

> P6: I don't know. I honestly would be interested to know what the GI bill benefit looks like, cause I bet you it's... I can't imagine that. You know every Veteran takes it. Well, I know every veteran doesn't, but I bet you maybe 50, probably less than 50% take advantage of GI Bill benefits, you know. So I initially think, hey, you know, I'm calling for healthcare.

> P6: Sorry my phone locked.

> P6: You know, I'm going to seek benefits for healthcare. Right? And you know, it's telling me 7, business days, I should receive a response.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. I'm not able to see your screen anymore. Which is a bit funny.

> P6: Yeah. My phone locked. I'm sorry. Hold on.

Tyler: Oh, that's okay.

> P6: And then go back to Zoom.

Tyler: Oh, perfect. It looks like you're gonna have to share it again annoyingly. We'll make sure we click around a little bit more so that it doesn't lock. That's helpful, though. So it sounds like healthcare, is definitely a primary use for you in terms of the VA. And probably a lot of other Veterans, and it felt like education was like having a big moment on that page we were looking at.

Tyler: Yeah, I totally get that.

Tyler: So I'll give you a second to share your screen, and then I'll tell you a little bit more of the scenario. We're gonna walk through together.

> P6: Okay... Back.

Tyler: perfect. Okay. So today, for the rest of our conversation, we're gonna just pretend like you need to ask the VA a question. We're gonna say that you've recently noticed some problems with your hearing. And you want to ask the VA how you get your hearing checked by an audiologist. So without clicking anything, yet can you tell me what you would do first?

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:46.100

> P6: Sign in or create an account.

Tyler: Does it seem like you need to sign in in order to start?

> P6: It does. I mean that's... But then I'm confused too, because there's the one link that says, that's green, and it talks about signing in for my education benefits or work study. And then there's another sign in or create account below that.

Tyler: And so it's hard to tell the difference between those?

> P6: Yeah... Check the chat status of your question. I mean, I guess without a reference number, I wouldn't use the check.

> P6: I don't know if I click on the Ask VA, is that going to take me to a link to where I can ask?

Tyler: I'm gonna do the annoying researcher thing and not answer your question. But that's helpful to know that that's not clear. And it also is really helpful to see that it feels like you need to sign in. But it's not clear if there's a difference between the 2 different buttons.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:59.370

> P6: Right. Or there's another link that says, Continue without signing in.

Tyler: Did you just notice that one?

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:08.640

> P6: I did just notice that one, but I mean, and then I continue to scroll down, and it says to call and ask for help. Or if I need help to call, you know, Monday through Friday to 9 Eastern time. At this 1 800 number. But also, if I'm having hearing loss problems. You know, am I gonna be able to?

Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful. Okay, so I think it's really clear to me that the sign in buttons were more obvious to you than the one that lets you go without signing in. For today, we're gonna go ahead and click continue without signing in. So we're gonna pretend that you don't need to sign in for your question. And we're going to get to this first page.

Tyler: So again, your question is about how to get your hearing checked. With that in mind, can you just show me how you would answer this page. What you would do on this page?

> P6: [Chooses health care]

Tyler: Alright, we can stop here. So you chose health care. That felt like a really quick decision. Did it feel like an obvious choice?

> P6: To me it did, just because... I don't remember what my options were. Can I go back?

Tyler: Yeah, you can go if you go down to the bottom and then you click. There you go, and then you click on back again.

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:36.759

> P6: back again. So like, education benefits and work study definitely doesn't fall under disability compensation. I'm not asking to be compensated. I'm asking how I get it checked right? So the disability compensation I feel, would come after. I mean, that's completely separate from having having it checked. And then health care. That's, you know, hearing, I assume. You know I correlate that to health. Debt for benefit over payments.

> P6: I can't scroll down. I'm sorry any further.

Tyler: No, that's okay. I think that sometimes the prototype will be a bit tricky. So let's just talk about that a little bit more. It felt like you were kind of using process of elimination. Healthcare made the most sense from what you can see on the screen.

Tyler: How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:23.179

> P6: Pretty, I mean pretty important, because if not, it's gonna take you down a rabbit hole, and they're completely separate entities. So there, I mean, if you, if you click on education benefits, it's not even the same department as healthcare or compensation, disability compensation. I mean, they're completely different departments. So you, you know, if you click on the wrong department, it's going to the wrong department.

> P6: You know it's gonna take you down a rabbit hole that you don't need to go down, and then, you know, you're back to pressing one for English, you know.

Tyler: That makes sense. Okay, let's click continue, and we'll see the next screen, which you looked at briefly. So tell me what you're seeing here.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:22.290

> P6: I see audiology and hearing aids, career opportunities at a VA health facility, caregiver support programs, eligibility, and how to apply family member benefits, our health benefits, foreign medical programs, getting care at the local VA medical center, prosthetics, Vet centers and readjustment counseling and women's health services.

Tyler: So what is this a list of?

> P6: Different options that I guess, you know, that you have available to you through the VA. Pertaining...

> P6: I don't know if the website is, you know, if this trial program is designed this way because I don't know that audiology and hearing aids. I don't know if that, you know traditionally is something outside of outside of normal medical care, you know. I think probably you go to the VA, and they would refer you to see somebody in that regard. But you know I understand. I understand where this is going, too.

> P6: You need a new prosthetic, ou know. It's very clear what I would do if I, you know, needed a prosthetic right? It's just this is clear to me.

Tyler: Okay, so it feels clear kind of what these options are related to and why you might choose one. How is this different from the last page?

> P6: It's more defined, you know, what you're looking for. Now, here's where this okay, so some things that I don't necessarily. Let's see, the career opportunities with VA Health that doesn't really make sense on here. You know. Cause if I already selected that I'm going for health, or I can't remember what my last choice was that got me to here right. But I don't know how career opportunities correlates to that or the caregiver support program. I'm not sure that that correlates to see all these other things as like medical stuff, and then like eligibility, how to apply that should be under receiving compensation. I believe that's what it was.

> P6: But yeah, there's almost, you know, some of it is like completely medical driven. And then other things are not.

Tyler: Right. Okay, there's a couple of things in the list that feel out of place. That's helpful. That makes sense.

Tyler: And so if our question today is about getting your hearing checked, can you show me what you would do on this page?

Tyler: Perfect. We'll just stay here for a second. So we found an option pretty quickly for hearing. What if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs in this list, what would you do, realistically?

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.400

> P6:  I'd probably just hit the getting care at a local VA medical center, and, you know, and hope that that would refer me somewhere, because it's not like there's an 'other' where I can list what I'm looking for, you know, put in there to where it goes to something. I think that that might be helpful. If if that was an option. But, you know, that's also an easy button, too, for somebody to not actually look for what they're, you know, looking for.

Tyler: Right. Okay. So you would make a best guess, maybe choose a more general option, and you try and keep going like that.

Tyler: That makes sense. Alright. Let's click continue. We'll go to the next page.

Tyler: Alright. What is this question asking you?

> P6: What's your question about. Well, I mean, I get, I think it's asking me why I'm coming, or you know, what I'm trying to accomplish right. Like, what is it for me, for somebody else? Or is it just a broad question that I'm trying to get in touch with.

> P6: I mean, it's not a clear statement. I guess if that makes sense.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So in this scenario, we're asking about getting your hearing checked. What would you choose, do you think?

> P6: Probably my own VA benefits, or it's a general question. I mean it. One or the other. I guess it depends if...

> P6: I know how the VA works, because I've worked for a wire transition unit before I got out of the army. So I know that, you know, unless you're over 50, I believe, or maybe more, it basically, it needs to be service connected in order for them to be you for you to be seen under their care. Right? Now the catch with that is, you can always be seen at the VA, it's just you may have to pay for it.

> P6: So it depends. If it was something that was diagnosed and was, you know, approved by the VA, then it would be my own VA benefits. If it was something I was already being treated for. I think if it was, you know, something new like I lost my hearing, you know, or my hearing continues getting worse, and I need to have it checked. I think it would be a general question. So it I think it depends on the scenario there, too.

> P6: Like for me, I have hearing aids. I'm talking to you through my hearing aids, so I already know when I get out, that'll be something that is connected with the VA, right? So for me personally, it would be my own VA benefits.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And we talked a little bit earlier about I think it was your wife using your GI bill benefits. Well, if you were asking a question related to that which one would you choose?

> P6: Well, so if it was me, it would still be there my benefits. She's just able to use them. So if it was her trying to get in touch with the VA, then it would be someone else's VA benefits .

Tyler: That's really helpful. Alright. So for today we're gonna choose my own VA benefits. And then we'll just click Continue.

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:56.980

> P6: Now, I understand that is very confusing for people, too, because, like, they don't understand that – like I didn't understand – I couldn't call on her behalf, like, they're still my benefits. Like, why can't I figure out what's going on with my benefits for her? You know?

Tyler: I totally hear you there.

Tyler: So, before we look too closely at this question, how much longer do you think this forms gonna be?

> P6: The form itself? Well, I'm assuming just 2 more questions.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And now, looking at this question, why do you think the VA is asking you this? I'll give you a minute to read it.

> P6: It's probably just a general question to figure out, you know, whether, if it's, whether you're trying to get information or file a complaint, I suppose? Or make, I mean, or make, I don't know... It's a kind of an odd question. I mean, obviously like, I'm, it almost feels out a place because I'm reaching out to the VA because I need something right? This isn't, II don't feel like this is the place to say something nice or file a complaint. If that makes sense?

Tyler: That makes sense.

> P6: That's probably for a survey purpose, not when I'm trying to ask a question or get an answer. I just kind of feel like, that's out of place.

Tyler: Yeah, I think that's really helpful. I can see why it feels that way.

Tyler: Well, today, let's choose I have a question.

> P6: Okay.

Tyler: And then we'll just click, continue. And now we're on this page. So I'm gonna ask you one more time, how much longer do you think this form is going to be?

> P6: Well, I thought 2 more questions, but it's probably going to be 10 more.

Tyler: And why are you saying 10?

> P6: I have no idea how much longer it's gonna be.

Tyler: And now, looking at, I mean, I would assume, you know, if I'm guessing, it's probably asking me what my question is, it's probably gonna ask me where I'm located, so it can place me in contact with somebody near nearby. Probably get contact information, that sort of thing. So I don't know how many more screens it would walk me down, but just trying to use logic. I think that would probably be a good process to follow.

00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:27.329

Tyler: That's really helpful. So you need to give them your question on this screen, obviously, and you need to give them where you're located, your contact information. And then, is there anything else you think you need to give the VA?

00:22:40.790 --> 00:22:57.180

> P6:  I don't know. Do you know, when I got out I never got a Vet ID card, so I don't know if there's like a number associated with that or not, because I know that they, I mean, in order for you to get healthcare, you've got to prove that you were a Veteran, if you're not already in the system, so you either have that, or you don't have that right. So probably something to prove that I would assume that you're a Veteran.

Tyler: Alright. And then, looking at this page, we're not actually gonna type anything in today. But does this feel straightforward? Do you know what you would do on this page?

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.340

> P6: It is to me. But I'm sure there's people in my cohort that wouldn't be able to figure it out, you know.

00:23:41.810 --> 00:23:47.660

Tyler: Yeah. And on the next page we're probably expecting to see something like your, what's your location?

Tyler: Okay, let's click continue. We'll imagine that we typed in your question about hearing. And then we just click, continue. And now we're seeing this page.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.560

> P6: Hey!

Tyler: So tell me about that reaction.

> P6: Well, I just, it makes sense. You know what I mean, I'm sure that the VA gets a lot of people that waste their time. You know, people that were chaptered out of the military or not. You know they're not eligible for benefits, for whatever reason. Right? And you know, the VA is a busy place. They don't necessarily have the time to vet people that aren't qualified. So yeah, that makes sense.

> P6: Like, I said, I don't know if there's a number associated with the Veteran, or if it goes off your social or how that works, I don't recall.

> P6: But yeah, I mean, the screen makes sense to me. I am a veteran, right? Like that.

> P6: Or if it was my spouse trying to contact you to set up something for me. I mean, it's still pretty straightforward. Yeah, okay, so it seems pretty easy to answer this. And it seems like it's a way to for us to know that you are definitely a veteran, or you're definitely a family member. Does this feel like the right time for us to ask you this question?

206
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.290
> P6: Mmm.

207
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.289
> P6: Probably should ask at the very beginning.

208
00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.679
> P6: in my opinion, just

209
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:26.530
> P6: that way. Well. I mean.

210
00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:38.619
> P6: I guess I don't really care if you're wasting somebody's time. There's not quite, you know that's not a veteran, but you know, for a veteran, right? II mean, I know if I'm a veteran it's not gonna frustrate me. If it's at this point.

211
00:25:38.670 --> 00:25:47.329
> P6: because it's it's not like it's gonna preclude me right? So now the but here's the thing right. It doesn't give you an option to not be a veteran.

212
00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.630
> P6: So like, what if I did this? You know being active duty?

213
00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:56.100
> P6: If I came here  you know, because I can't go

214
00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.189
> P6: I can't go to the Va. Right now to get healthcare.

215
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:04.560
Tyler: or, you know, being on active duty because I have tricia so

216
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:11.260
> P6: you know that maybe something to look at, you know. Just so people understand?

217
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:15.269
Tyler: Yeah, I can see that. So it feels like,

218
00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:28.019
Tyler: it's fine because you're a veteran. You can access Va. Services that you would just have this question whenever it's easy to answer. But if it's trying to filter people out, it needs to happen early on. That makes sense.

219
00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:43.450
> P6: Honestly, I think if you're at this, you know, I'm sorry I'm but I think if you're you know at, if you're at this depth into the Va system. You're you're probably there for the right reason, right? Like you.

220
00:26:43.630 --> 00:26:49.020
Tyler: you know, I don't think anybody's going to go through this if they're not qualified. So yeah.

221
00:26:49.210 --> 00:26:54.350
Tyler: alright. Well, we're on this new screen now. And why do you think the Va. Is asking you this question

222
00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.700
that? I don't know. I don't know if you're precluded from

223
00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:10.910
> P6: being seen at the Va. If you're an employee there, I don't. I don't know. Not sure on that one. Yeah. Do you feel like you're gonna receive a different service, depending on how you answer this.

224
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:16.320
> P6: I don't. I don't feel that way. No, I just know. II know that like sometimes with

225
00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:34.559
> P6: like Gs employees and soldiers that serve in the guard, they're not it eligible for like tricare reserve. Select right? Right. They have to buy their benefits through their employer. So I don't know if the Va. Is, you know, something along those lines to where they're not eligible for service if they work there. II don't know. I,

226
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:45.769
Tyler: yeah, yeah, that's okay. I don't know, is a good answer, too. So it feels like It might be another way of filtering. Who can do certain things? Yeah, okay.

227
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.449
Tyler: And how would you answer this question? You can just show me.

228
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.109
> P6: I mean, I would click. Now, okay.

229
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:53.620
Tyler: let's click now and then we'll click. Continue.

230
00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:54.530
> P6: Okay.

231
00:27:57.690 --> 00:28:08.059
Tyler: alright. So we're not actually gonna type anything in like I said, but let's look at these questions, and then I wanna know if anything is standing out to you, so you can just talk aloud as you're looking at this page.

232
00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:09.720
> P6: Hmm.

233
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:16.170
> P6: no, nothing in first name, middle or last. That's pretty standard

234
00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.079
> P6: preferred name. I

235
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:25.490
> P6: you know. II guess I can see that like my name is P6. But I go by [nickname], so

236
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.160
> P6: sure

237
00:28:28.330 --> 00:28:31.900
> P6: service number. So

238
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:44.770
> P6: that's gonna start meaning a lot of different things to people here real soon. like I have a do-did number right? Couldn't tell you what it is. Have no idea. And anytime I call the hospital here to make an appointment.

239
00:28:44.870 --> 00:28:52.750
> P6: They are like, hey? What's your Dod id number? Couldn't tell you I don't know. But I'll give you my social service number.

240
00:28:53.260 --> 00:29:03.430
> P6: I think you'll see these young, this younger generation of soldiers, sailors, and marines, and airmen, will probably equate that to their do-did number in the future.

241
00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:06.370
> P6:  But, like my generation.

242
00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:12.639
> P6: We don't. We don't have a service number that's like World War Ii error, Vietnam era. That's not a thing for us.

243
00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:17.239
> P6: So like we just go off for social, but it's not saying that it's required either.

244
00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:25.110
> P6: Please provide one or the other. So you know, most people know their social. That's pretty standard date of birth, obviously.

245
00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.430
> P6: Yup

246
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.269
> P6: again, that's pretty standard.

247
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:36.329
> P6: I I'm not gonna get into the pronouns thing that's not for me.

248
00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.020
Tyler: So if that's not for you, how would you answer that question

249
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:44.779
> P6: he him his, I guess.

250
00:29:44.910 --> 00:29:47.790
Tyler: Okay, so you would just kind of like, choose an option. Alright.

251
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:52.769
> P6: yeah, do I have to choose an option? Yeah, I guess it says, I have to.

252
00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:57.809
> P6: Yeah. yeah. And the gender identity.

253
00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:04.619
> P6: Yeah, I don't get behind all that stuff. So I'm a man.

254
00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:13.389
Tyler: Yeah, so would you choose to answer that question, or would you choose, man? Okay.

255
00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:26.070
Tyler: alright. We went through that pretty quickly. It felt fairly straightforward. I don't think I have any any. Follow up questions on that one, so we'll pretend, like we filled it in with your information. And then we're gonna click, continue.

256
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.120
> P6: Okay.

257
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:32.040
Tyler: And now I'd just love for you to describe what you're looking at to me

258
00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:46.730
> P6: the Va health facility. So it looks like a search. And then I don't know what I put in there.  I mean search so that there's a dropdown or plus underneath it that says search by location.

259
00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:54.080
> P6: So I guess I would click on that, because that you know, how would I know unless I was being seen

260
00:30:54.330 --> 00:31:03.709
> P6: right? Well, it's twofold, because I may know what facility I'm supposed to be seeing that. But say, I'm contacting via for the first time, I would probably search my location.

261
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:09.029
Tyler: Okay? So if you didn't know your facility yet, you would search by location.

262
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:22.560
Tyler: But then, if you knew the name like, let's say, you know. I think you said you might have went to a Va. Health health facility in New York. So if you knew the name of that facility, can you just give me an idea of what you would type in there?

263
00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:28.949
> P6: Yeah, I would type in like Wat Watertown Vet center, I think, is what it was called

264
00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:40.909
Tyler: and that that you know, I'm sure that that would get me close. Okay, cool. And which which one would you use now in like with your veteran current veteran status

265
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.909
> P6: probably search by location.

266
00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:49.589
> P6: Just that cause. I mean, like I live in Colorado Springs. It's huge. I don't know.

267
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:53.659
> P6: There may be multiple centers here. I don't know.

268
00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:56.979
> P6: you know, I know, like my. So my brother in law lives in

269
00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:03.830
> P6: Georgia, and I think there's 2 Va. Hospitals alone right there where he lives.

270
00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.179
> P6: you know. So he he probably has more options

271
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:14.549
> P6: than a lot of people where the, you know, I lived in rural Montana for a long time. And there I don't even, I think it was like

272
00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:18.589
> P6: 3 h 4 h to the closest Va.

273
00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:22.030
> P6:  you know. So there, you just

274
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:31.800
Tyler: right? Okay, so II kind of get the sense that you can see a use for like both options, searching by name or searching by location.

275
00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:35.110
> P6: Yeah, the the only thing is the search by location. I don't.

276
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:45.449
> P6: I'm wondering if you could just put that function into the Va health facility, you know, or somehow, like search by location or

277
00:32:45.490 --> 00:32:57.500
> P6: my for the health facility. If it was in either or right where you could either put the town in that you're you know, closest to, or that you know whatever wherever you're at.

278
00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:02.080
> P6: or if it was you know I could punch in the exact facility.

279
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:09.549
Tyler: Right? Okay. So taking the decision out of your hands, you can just type in what you want to type in, and then it'll give you the the list

280
00:33:09.770 --> 00:33:22.619
Tyler: that that makes sense. Alright. So we're not gonna type in this today. And it is a prototype. So it's not gonna work perfectly. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like your health facility starts with the the word James.

281
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:34.880
Tyler: So I'm gonna have you click on that box? Yeah, perfect. And then we're gonna pretend like you typed in James. And then let's say your health facilities, called James J. Peters, can you just show me what you would do here?

282
00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:40.340
Tyler: Okay.

283
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.490
Tyler: so what are we seeing now?

284
00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.350
Tyler: Can you describe this to me?

285
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:48.569
> P6: Yeah, I just see the

286
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:57.420
> P6: a blue, the blue check or blue, the circles filled in next to James J. Peter, Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center, Bronx, New York.

287
00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.800
Tyler: Okay?

288
00:33:59.350 --> 00:34:00.850
Tyler: So it tells me

289
00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:02.000
> P6: continually.

290
00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:14.719
Tyler: okay, so it looks like you've chosen an option now. And what if we don't need to click anything? But what if you realize that you had chosen the wrong health facility, what would you do at this point?

291
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:20.460
> P6: Either hit back or try to? I mean.

292
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:30.770
> P6: I guess if it was a different option, say, it was James A. Then I would go up and click on that one. I would assume that it would transfer back

293
00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:36.669
Tyler:  okay, cool. Let's click continue and we'll move on

294
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:44.789
Tyler: alright so before we talk about this page i just want to check in how much longer do you think this forms going to be?

295
00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:53.290
> P6: Hi? Hopefully, not much longer. I would think that we're about done. I mean, I don't know what else it could possibly ask. Yeah.

296
00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.730
Tyler: But my initial take on. This is, I feel it's out of place.

297
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.779
Tyler: Okay, tell me more about that.

298
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.439
> P6: So I mean. I would think that if if you're gonna ask me my

299
00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:17.789
> P6: my name and date of birth and social security number and all of my pii, that you would just ask me my phone number and email address at the same time, I mean, that's one less screen, right? So it it is all

300
00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.380
> P6: I mean, I would assume that it all goes together.

301
00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:38.089
Tyler: Okay, so you're like associating this with the list of like that, said your name, your social security number, your date of birth. All of that that makes sense to me. So we kind of like we went from that to the health facility. And now we're back to like sort of thing. Yeah, I see that

302
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:46.049
Tyler:  awesome. So we won't fill this in. But can you just like describe to me? Is anything here.

303
00:35:46.090 --> 00:35:49.660
Tyler: look jumping out at you. Does it feel straightforward to fill this in?

304
00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.269
> P6: No, it's straightforward to fill it in? I mean, okay.

305
00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:56.340
Tyler: it tells you exactly what it's asking for.

306
00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.230
> P6: You know, what what if you don't have an email address though

307
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:04.330
> P6:  and it says, it's required, you know, I

308
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.860
> P6: is it. I mean, we still have old veterans right? Like

309
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:14.669
> P6: it's not like not everybody's young. So you know, they might not have one.

310
00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:21.800
Tyler: Yeah, that's a good point. So, noticing that both of these are required, and that might work, not work for everybody.

311
00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:29.059
> P6: Why do you think it's asking for this information? In the first place.

312
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:37.649
Tyler: so can get. They can get in touch with you, probably to schedule an appointment or to if they need to further assist.

313
00:36:38.010 --> 00:36:43.340
Tyler: Okay. well, let's say we typed in your phone number in your email, and then we'll click, continue.

314
00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.380
> P6: Yup, here we are.

315
00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:54.410
Tyler: So without clicking anything, what would you normally do on this page.

316
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:57.400
I would hit phone.

317
00:36:57.830 --> 00:36:58.700
Tyler: Yeah.

318
00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:07.709
> P6: yeah, it. That's the easiest way to get a hold of me, you know, like, I do check my emails often, but you know it's I'd rather talk to somebody than

319
00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:16.230
> P6: get a text or an email, or whatever. I much rather talk to somebody to confirm.

320
00:37:17.320 --> 00:37:19.590
Tyler: that makes sense,

321
00:37:19.930 --> 00:37:23.530
> P6: checks might be helpful truthfully on there, too.

322
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:27.110
Tyler: yeah, text as an option.

323
00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.810
Tyler: yeah, I can definitely see that

324
00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:39.710
Tyler: so for today, I know this isn't what you would normally choose. But honestly, for the purpose of testing this website, we're gonna have you choose us mail

325
00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:43.489
> P6: so we'll click on us mail, and then we'll click, continue

326
00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:58.120
> P6: alright. So now we're looking at this screen. So without clicking on anything, can you tell me what you're seeing here and what you would do. Yeah, this is a country where you receive mail.

327
00:37:58.490 --> 00:38:06.310
> P6: and then it's asking me to select the country where you see your mail and a dropdown.

328
00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:11.499
> P6: Or if I receive my mail outside the united states on a military base

329
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:15.870
Tyler:  Apoe, I, guess,

330
00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:20.189
> P6: yeah, II would assume. you know, but I would just

331
00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:30.229
> P6: click the country where I receive my mail. But again I would probably default to this could probably back in the Pi section where they're asking my name. And you know

332
00:38:30.570 --> 00:38:33.699
Tyler: that sort of stuff. Yeah.

333
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:39.079
Tyler: cause I bet you the next screen is, gonna tell me to put my address in.

334
00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:45.069
Tyler: I guess we'll have to see. So let's put in. Let's put in your country. You can go ahead and click that.

335
00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.379
Tyler: and then we'll continue.

336
00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:59.799
Tyler: and then it looks like this. This matches your expectation, which is good. So we've got your your street address. Is anything jumping out at you here. Anything different to normal

337
00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:01.779
Tyler: filling out your address forms.

338
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.940
> P6: No, it's straightforward.

339
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:10.089
Tyler: I mean, don't get me wrong. This isn't bad. It's not like it's a bad system. It's like it

340
00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:38.590
Tyler: either way.

341
00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:39.570
> P6: Okay?

342
00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:43.030
Tyler: And then what is this page asking for?

343
00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:49.680
> P6: Correct address? Or to verify my address? Right? Yeah, we can't confirm your address. You entered with us postal service.

344
00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:54.240
> P6: And yeah, just making sure that the address is correct.

345
00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.040
Tyler: Okay, have you seen something like this before?

346
00:39:57.300 --> 00:39:59.670
> P6: Yeah, I have. Because I,

347
00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:13.719
Tyler: when I lived in rural Montana, I had an address that was kind of like that. There was a north side of the street, the south side of the street. And do you usually choose the suggestion? Or it depends on what they suggest?

348
00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:22.190
Tyler: I usually go with the suggestion, because that's how the postal service sees it so like just to make sure that it's right with the postal service.

349
00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:28.910
> P6: But it could cause a problem too, right, because it might get delivered across the street. If it's a North or a South, or you know.

350
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:32.740
> P6: or maybe they've half fingered Ds in the address. So

351
00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:36.160
> P6: you know. it could be

352
00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:43.859
Tyler: double-edged, I guess. Yeah, okay, so this feels like a familiar thing. You've seen it before. You'd kinda know what you would do.

353
00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.259
Tyler: and and it looks like that's already selected for you. So we'll click. Continue

354
00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:49.280
> P6: supposing

355
00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:51.910
Tyler: alright. So.

356
00:40:52.520 --> 00:41:00.230
Tyler: without clicking anything yet just have a have a look at this page, and then I'd just love for you to describe to me this page. What's the purpose of it?

357
00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:07.309
> P6:  I would assume to make sure that all your information that you entered is correct.

358
00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:13.300
> P6: and if there's anything that is not correct, you have the ability to edit, make changes.

359
00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:16.930
> P6: to make sure that the process goes through, as

360
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:21.699
Tyler: according or you know, according to plan, I was supposed to.

361
00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:27.640
Tyler: So if you were looking at this website and I wasn't here. What would you normally do?

362
00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:34.169
> P6:  I mean, I probably would just hit submit questions because

363
00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.720
> P6: I would check my stuff before I submitted it on the last on the prior pages.

364
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:47.580
> P6: you know, II would probably say most people are gonna be the same way not not go back through all of those pages of things.

365
00:41:47.720 --> 00:41:48.820
> P6: Yeah.

366
00:41:49.560 --> 00:42:09.539
> P6: I think probably what you're looking for is me to click on the buttons, to expand, to make sure that that makes sense. So I am going to have you look at them. But it's helpful to know what you'd more likely do. So I'm gonna just have you open category and topic first, and we'll look at that one. Okay.

367
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.549
Tyler: alright. So what are you seeing here?

368
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:25.480
> P6: So it's just verifying everything that it asked me initially, right, what category best subscribes my questions, which is health care? And the topic that describes my question, audiology and hearing

369
00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.849
> P6: right? How much

370
00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:27.980
> P6: that, was it?

371
00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:33.520
Tyler: Yeah. So that feels pretty familiar. And can we change this information?

372
00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:40.530
> P6: It doesn't look like you can. I don't. I don't know. No.

373
00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.200
> P6: let me name it. Oh, wait!

374
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:50.250
> P6: There's an edit button. See it now. Okay,

375
00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:56.759
> P6: that. Yeah, there's an edit. But under under the next one, under your question.

376
00:42:56.900 --> 00:42:57.810
Tyler: Okay.

377
00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.839
> P6: but I don't think that that goes

378
00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:04.559
> P6: to the category and topic. So I can't add, can't edit the category and topic.

379
00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.490
Tyler: Okay.

380
00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:10.350
Tyler: do you think you realistically. That's something you'd want to edit at this point.

381
00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:14.239
> P6: No, I don't. I think you're too far in. I don't think that you would.

382
00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:22.439
> P6: I think that you know why you're contacting them right? Like I don't. I don't know. Yeah, that's how I feel. I mean.

383
00:43:22.510 --> 00:43:26.910
> P6: I would have just backed out a long time ago I clicked on the wrong button.

384
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:32.209
Tyler: Is it? Is it even helpful to see what your category and topic is at this point?

385
00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:39.929
> P6: I don't think so, because it's asking you, and then I know you didn't tell me to go there, but the next one is asking me.

386
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:43.769
> P6: You know what I want. So

387
00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:49.880
> P6: you know again, if I directed it correctly the first time, then

388
00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:56.590
> P6: my question that I'm asking is going to tell you what I want, you know, or my category and topic right?

389
00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:04.789
Tyler: I don't know that verifying that in in. Okay, so what if it's wrong? I can't do anything about it at this point.

390
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:07.040
> P6: you know, right?

391
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:11.820
Tyler: That makes sense. Let's let's open personal information. And we'll look at that one.

392
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.900
> P6: Okay.

393
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.060
> P6: see? Okay.

394
00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:18.910
> P6: now.

395
00:44:28.170 --> 00:44:35.049
> P6: yeah. And it gives me the ability, the ability to edit most of this stuff. So

396
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:37.280
> P6: which is helpful

397
00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:58.229
> P6: because you could, you could get the wrong facility right like I. I'm sure, if you live in New York City, and there's probably numerous vas around that area, you know, or in that Tri City area or Tri State area, you know that you may want. Maybe you live in New York and you want to be seen in New Jersey, or maybe you live. Wanna be seen in Pennsylvania. I don't know. You know.

398
00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.860
> P6: yeah, I think that having that ability, you know.

399
00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:11.270
> P6: to edit that that makes sense. Yeah. Okay. So certain things you wouldn't need to edit. But there's other things where it actually is useful to be able to edit it.

400
00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:16.869
Tyler: Let's let's pretend like you typed in your phone number wrong. Can you show me what you would do?

401
00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:18.890
> P6: Yeah.

402
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:22.150
Tyler: okay.

403
00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:28.470
Tyler: so you won't be able to click any further than this. But can you describe to me. Now what you would do on this screen?

404
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:40.030
Tyler: Yeah, I would just update the phone number, you know, change the phone number and the phone number block and then hit. Update. Okay? And then this little section, can you tell me which fields are editable?

405
00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.799
Tyler: in the contact information?

406
00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:47.159
> P6: Yeah. In this P specific section is just a phone number and email.

407
00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:53.530
> P6: And then I'm assuming you can hit the edit button underneath that and change the address if you need to.

408
00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.760
Tyler: Right? Okay.

409
00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:59.120
> P6: let's click on cancel. Right?

410
00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.250
Tyler: And we'll just scroll down. And then at this point we'll say, we're ready to submit our question.

411
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:05.420
> P6: Okay.

412
00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:09.940
Tyler: And I'm just gonna give you a minute to read this.

413
00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:11.280
> P6: And I'm

414
00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:24.470
> P6: okay.

415
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.609
> P6: So it's telling me I should get something in the mail in 7 days

416
00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:34.000
Tyler: in regards to my question.

417
00:46:35.290 --> 00:46:40.550
Tyler: Okay? And is there anything else any other information you're learning here?

418
00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:45.699
> P6: Nothing that I'm learning? I mean, it gives me my reference number and everything. But I mean.

419
00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:51.199
> P6: that I should receive an email, a confirmation email that I submitted it.

420
00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.010
> P6: Yeah, that's it. Okay.

421
00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:59.840
Tyler: At this point in the process. is there anything else that you'd want to know?

422
00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:07.200
> P6: No, I don't think so  Nope.

423
00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:18.979
Tyler: okay. awesome that felt pretty, clear throughout the process. Why don't you go ahead and stop sharing your screen, and we'll just take a couple of minutes. For

424
00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:21.749
Tyler: you and I to reflect.

425
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:26.229
> P6: stop sharing there go

426
00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:28.260
Tyler: awesome

427
00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:37.799
Tyler: alright. So we went through a whole bunch of steps, and I know we talked a lot through it. But what did you find? How did you think of the process overall?

428
00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:44.209
> P6: Ii mean, it was pretty straightforward, honestly once, other than the initial screen.

429
00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:51.349
> P6: It was pretty straightforward. The initial screen II probably would have been trying to create a login instead of

430
00:47:51.740 --> 00:48:04.359
> P6: just continuing without login but other than that. It was pretty straightforward. I think there was some things that you could have done to streamline it a little bit, just adding, you know, moving like the address and phone number, and all of that under

431
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:09.389
> P6: to where it's just one screen for pi, and it's done right.

432
00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:24.529
> P6: instead of you know you kind of bounced around a little bit in the middle there from, you know, finding a healthcare facility to going back to giving you my pii. So I just that's my my thoughts on it. It wasn't frustrating, by any means. It's just

433
00:48:24.610 --> 00:48:27.209
> P6: like, Oh, we're back to this, you know. Just

434
00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:46.740
Tyler: yeah, no, that makes sense. That's really helpful at the beginning, like we talked about how that homepage was a little confusing, and you were like, should I sign in do you think there's any benefit to having signed in like we did? We went through that process, and you you didn't sign in? Do you think there's any benefit to signing in.

435
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:51.729
> P6: I think if you were signed in, then it would probably prevent you from entering the Pi stuff.

436
00:48:51.870 --> 00:48:56.720
Tyler: Well, I would hope so right because it should know who I am. If I'm signed in.

437
00:48:56.810 --> 00:49:01.239
> P6: I would assume I don't know. I would assume that I can set

438
00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:04.910
> P6: my you know my facility

439
00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:19.269
> P6: that I want to be seen at if I'm signed in. Well, depending, you know, like I said, I guess if you're somebody that's already being seen for something, or if you're a new, you know new person. You probably don't have all of that stuff yet, you know, but

440
00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:20.270
> P6: I'm

441
00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:25.810
> P6: I don't know. Not sure what what it looks like when you sign in, I guess.

442
00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:34.480
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, that's okay. But you're you're thinking that it'll be simpler, and that you might not have to put in your pi because they already know

443
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:39.449
Tyler: who you are. Do you think you need to review your Pii?

444
00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:46.220
> P6: Oh, yeah, I think you should always review it just because I mean. you know, addresses change all the time. I mean. I

445
00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:54.499
> P6: hopefully, when I retire, I'm not moving all the time. But you know, I've moved like 23 times. So

446
00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.699
> P6: yeah, that makes sense.

447
00:49:57.130 --> 00:50:14.760
Tyler: And I guess if we just like step back for a second. And we think about like this process for contacting the Va. I'm sure you've contacted other organizations before, or companies, or whatever is there anything like overall that could be done a lot better. Is there any kind of like blue sky thinking or

448
00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:32.340
> P6: close? Compare? I don't think so. I mean honestly, if the if contact in a Va. Was that easy as it was like I just did then that would be awesome right? Because I think a lot of people get frustrated with the process and give up because they're they don't want to sit on hold.

449
00:50:32.530 --> 00:50:34.050
> P6: or you know they

450
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:39.190
> P6: tell them the wrong department, you know, and it goes back to, you know, some people just don't know. They just

451
00:50:39.330 --> 00:50:52.589
> P6: they don't get it right. And you know, I I'm sure if I click the educational benefits, and they sent me to that department they're gonna refer me to who I need to talk to. But at the same time, if I'm you know, spending an hour on hold

452
00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:53.860
> P6: to, then

453
00:50:54.180 --> 00:51:14.120
Tyler: get sent someplace else, and then I'm sitting another hour on. Hold! That's gonna be pretty frustrating right? And I may just give up my hearing that important. I don't know. Right? Yeah. So it feels like if if your question ended up in the wrong place, and you were using a service like this. Hopefully, they would sort it out, and you wouldn't have to sit there waiting.

454
00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:19.369
> P6: Right? Well, and II mean, I've I'm assuming, you know, that they would filter it like I said, through that

455
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.739
> P6: through that system and get me to the right place. yeah, that's what I would think.

456
00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:29.350
Tyler: How do you think they would filter it like, how would they know where to put your question?

457
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:34.139
> P6: Well, I mean right? The question that specific question

458
00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:46.800
> P6: was pretty targeted. I mean, if I want to get my hearing checked. it's not like you can send me to get my hearing checked. You know the ophthalmologist, you know, I can only get my hearing checked at Audiology.

459
00:51:46.800 --> 00:52:10.520
> P6: There might be there. There's going to be things that obviously aren't as straightforward as hearing right like, hey? I have my backwards. Well, that could be. Who knows? I have kidney problems, do I have you know what's go? What's going on? Is it muscular, is it skeleton? You know there's so many different things that could factor into it. But for this specific example is very straightforward. So you know. And then you're gonna have people that just ask broad, you know, broad based

460
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:16.399
> P6: questions that aren't very targeted. So the Va is probably gonna have a hard time

461
00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:22.249
> P6: directing them, you know. And that's on the individual, too, you know.

462
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:31.289
Tyler: Yeah. So it feels like when you're asking your question, it's important for it to be like specific and maybe detailed. So people can send it to the right place.

463
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:34.629
Tyler: Yeah, cool?

464
00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:47.610
> P6: well, I've asked you a ton of questions. We've got a few minutes left. Do you have any questions for me? It could be about what we're doing could be about. No, II appreciate what you guys are doing. I mean, I'm all about improving processes. So

465
00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.280
> P6: thank you for what you guys are doing.

466
00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:51.509
> P6: We appreciate it.

467
00:52:51.680 --> 00:53:10.600
Tyler: Well, II really appreciate it. I always say, like, we wouldn't be able to do what we're doing if it wasn't for conversations like this. So I've learned a lot today. We're speaking to a bunch of veterans over the next a couple of days to learn more from from different perspectives. So yeah, thank you so much for your time.

468
00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:24.490
Tyler: Perigee. And they're the folks who set up this research session. They're gonna send you a think, you know, and they're gonna have some information in there for other veterans if they want to participate in future studies. And if you have any questions, you can always let them know.

469
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:33.069
Tyler: But I yeah, I think we're all done. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.
