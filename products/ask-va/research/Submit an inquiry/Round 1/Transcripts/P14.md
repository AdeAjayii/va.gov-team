## Transcript - NEED TO CLEAN UP

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
Just right now.

2
00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:11.230
Becky: Alright. So I've started recording. And I'd like to confirm again, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

3
00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.290
> P14: Yes.

4
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.490
Becky: perfect.

5
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.310
> P14: Alright. So it looks like we are ready to get started.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.709
Becky: So just a couple of quick questions at the beginning for us to just learn more about your experience with Va and our online services.

7
00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.649
Becky: So first off, how long have you been a veteran?

8
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.169
> P14: Since 1987.

9
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.930
Becky: Oh, that's amazing. You've remembered the date exactly as well. August seventeenth, 19.

10
00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.599
Becky: Have you ever contacted Va online or over the phone?

11
00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.210
> P14: Both

12
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.499
Becky: got it? And

13
00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:03.359
> P14: why did you contact the V online? Or can you tell me about the time when you contacted Va online?

14
00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.170
> P14: I was in the using the chat box when the chat box.

15
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.750
when that was coming out

16
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.749
> P14: to get the status of my claims. Yeah.

17
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.180
Becky: to get the status of your claims and have you ever done this over the phone as well?

18
00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.899
> P14: Yes. I well, I had to. Yeah. I had to call that 800 number

19
00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.300
> P14: to get the status that up my abilities.

20
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.279
Becky: Got it? Yeah, it's interesting to hear you views both the online chat on. Then also the phone, too.

21
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.809
> P14: That's really helpful to understand.

22
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:53.959
Becky: Alright, so those were just some quick questions to learn more about your experience in general and next, I'd like to share some ideas in that prototype I mentioned earlier to get your feedback.

23
00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:11.369
Becky: So in the chat I'm going to send you a link to the prototype. And I mentioned earlier earlier that this is like a test version of the website. So it's not gonna work perfectly. But you can click around in some ways. And this is a way to help us learn what we need to improve before we share it with more people.

24
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.749
Becky: So let me drop that link for you. Yes,

25
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:18.750
Becky: alright.

26
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.400
Becky: I'm sending this in the chat right now.

27
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.910
Becky: and let me know when you've opened it, or if you can open it.

28
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.050
Hi, everyone.

29
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.760
Becky: were you able to find that link and open it?

30
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.509
> P14: Okay, it's opening on. It's opening. It's opening on another tab. So

31
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.320
> P14: it's pigma.

32
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.490
> P14: Right? Yeah, it's trying to open

33
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:18.260
Becky: is yeah, what? They're just loading right? Now.

34
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.280
Okay.

35
00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.679
> P14:  okay, so is that, okay.

36
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.580
Becky: what was that? You're breaking up a little bit.

37
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.459
> P14: Did you open it when opened it up? Ale?

38
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.999
Yes, they opened in a different tab. So when I'm on that

39
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.009
> P14: good to see you.

40
00:03:52.080 --> 00:04:02.929
Becky: That's fine, and I think it might be breaking up a little bit. The file might be a little big, so I'm going to stop sharing my video just to save our bandwidth a little bit. Maybe that'll help

41
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:20.420
Becky: alright. And Terry. Yeah, it seems like you're frozen there, too. Do you mind? Just turning off your video, too, just to make sure that our connection is strong. Right now.

42
00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.650
Becky: it's just the video camera. Yeah, I think we're both freezing a little bit right now. Alright.

43
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:39.870
Becky: So you have the screen open in another tab. Now, have you shared your screen before on Zoom?

44
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.390
No.

45
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.690
Becky: no, okay? I can help walk you through that.

46
00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.100
Becky: So if you go back to your zoom window

47
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.810
> P14: you'll see the share screen icon at the bottom. It's a green button that you can press.

48
00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.770
Oh, yeah. Yes.

49
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:10.930
Becky: Alright so go ahead and click that and then share your window that has the sigma prototype open.

50
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:32.379
> P14: Okay, so do you want the I got a choice between Microsoft edge, tab window or entire screen?

51
00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:40.030
Becky: You just you can just share with me the Microsoft Edge tab window. I think that's what you said.

52
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.300
> P14: Okay.

53
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.649
> P14: desktop protocol. Okay, there we go. Okay, got it

54
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:53.770
Becky: alright.

55
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.080
Becky: Just taking a bit to load.

56
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.890
Becky: Okay. I think we got it.

57
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:13.290
> P14: Okay, thanks. Gary  alright.

58
00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:30.959
Becky: so now, we're going to i'll see some questions about the prototype. So I'll just give you a a few minutes or a moment to look at this page, and then, as you're looking through it and feel free to scroll scroll around, too. Can you tell me what you no notice first on this page?

59
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.039
> P14: Oh, that you gotta sign in?

60
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.570
> P14: Well, it tells you if it's about education work study. I did gotta sign in. Yeah.

61
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:52.190
Becky: got it. So sounds like you're you're clinging into this the screen box here. And why does that stand out to you?

62
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:58.749
> P14: Because that's what you always have to do to get onto the Va, any website they have, you gotta sign in

63
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:00.520
> P14: or create an account.

64
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:02.760
Becky: Got it?

65
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:12.399
Becky: Yeah, that makes sense. That you're clinging into the the signing in from maybe a past experience you've had with with the Va website.

66
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:24.079
> P14: Yeah. And that's why I do it for my phone. Cause you have to do that, you just it just hit it in this. do face. Id? And Yen, yeah, that's really helpful to understand.

67
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:33.569
Becky: So for the rest of our conversation, I'd like you to pretend that in this scenario you need to ask the Via question.

68
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:42.379
Becky: So let's say that you recently noticed some problems with your hearing, and you want to ask Va. How to get your hearing checked by an audiologist.

69
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:52.190
Becky: So keeping in mind that you have a question about getting your hearing checked without clicking anything just yet. Can you tell me what you would do first on this page.

70
00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:57.259
> P14: Well, only well, I can't see the whole page. So

71
00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:01.119
Becky: oh, you can. You can scroll around if that helps.

72
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.180
> P14: Okay.

73
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.280
Becky: yeah.

74
00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.579
> P14: Oh, right.

75
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.630
Becky: I just wanted to understand what you would do first if you had a question about getting your hearing checked.

76
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:17.740
Oh, gosh!

77
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.010
> P14: If I had a question about it.

78
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:33.199
Record. Yes, you can't. Yeah, you gonna have to.

79
00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:43.669
> P14: I guess I would click the search and look for. But I'll make, you know you can't ask a question on here about

80
00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:49.099
> P14: send an appointment for audiology. You gotta log in to do it, or you've got a call, so

81
00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:51.719
> P14: I don't know what the purpose of this site would do for that.

82
00:08:52.310 --> 00:09:00.180
Becky: Hmm, gotcha, yeah, that's really interesting that maybe you would search for your answer first, or sign in, or call

83
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:06.879
Becky:  And just reading through this page further, do you see any other benefits to signing in?

84
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.020
> P14: But I mean you would have to sign in to look at

85
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.249
> P14: nice to you

86
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.450
signing, because if you don't sign

87
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:35.400
> P14: anything to pretend to use, only, like general questions, you can type in a search box and hope it comes back to you. But usually I don't do that cause II don't have time to to waste to be doing it. So I just

88
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.030
call our signing.

89
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:49.510
Becky: Hmm, so it sounds like from your perspective. You need to sign in to ask maybe more specific questions. And just searching around is is going to waste time.

90
00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:56.529
> P14: Yeah. Cause usually, when you do the search, it comes back and tell you you need to sign, anyway. So

91
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:13.229
Becky: yeah, exactly that that makes sense to me. So just for the session today, we're going to actually click, continue without signing in which is further down the page. So it'll be

92
00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:22.219
Becky: a link that you can click here. So it seems like it. It wasn't apparent that you could ask a question without signing in, which is fine. It's just

93
00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:30.970
Becky: further up under the button, a little hidden there. Oh, continue without signing in. Okay, here we go. Yes, okay.

94
00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:33.500
> P14: alrighty.

95
00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:43.249
Becky: Alright. So we're on this new page and again, I mentioned earlier. We're pretending, like you need to ask via question about how to get your hearing checked.

96
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:45.370
> P14: So with that in mind.

97
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:49.919
Becky: yeah, can you show me what you would do first? I see you're already hovering over?

98
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:51.940
Becky: that box fair

99
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.379
> P14: go here.

100
00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:04.000
> P14: and I would let me see education, disability, comp healthcare. Hmm!

101
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:14.719
Becky: Got it? Sorry you're breaking up a little before then. What were you saying? There?

102
00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:29.040
> P14: I was. I was click on the box to see if it's in here. So in there was healthcare, so I guess that would be the category. Because since that's on the Ca, that's the only category now. Won't even let me

103
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.600
> P14: click in the box now.

104
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:47.429
Becky: Got it? And yeah, that might be the prototype talking here. But it sounds like you're looking, maybe, for audiology. But then you selected healthcare here. How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

105
00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.290
> P14: Hmm.

106
00:11:52.730 --> 00:12:02.750
> P14: Well, I mean, it's just taking you through extra step, I mean, cause you you're not. Obviously you can't get straight to whatever specialty you're trying to get to. You gotta

107
00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.000
> P14: click on all these categories and then and hope that the next one will

108
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.670
> P14: take you to the sub category, and

109
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:11.870
that's too much

110
00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:17.290
Becky: got it. And what? And why? Do you think it's too much? I'm curious about that.

111
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:24.070
> P14: Because well, because you don't really know if this gonna take you to where you needed to go.

112
00:12:26.070 --> 00:12:37.079
Becky: Got it? So it sounds like you're at this point. You're a little uncertain on what's gonna happen next? So let's go ahead and click. Continue to see what's on the next page.

113
00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:44.070
> P14: Alright. Now, can you show me what you do on this page.

114
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:50.160
> P14: Okay? So I'm gonna do hearing. I'll do oscillate audiology and hearing aids.

115
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.430
> P14: Yep.

116
00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:59.560
Becky: alright. And how do you think this question is different from the last one that you answered.

117
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.249
> P14: Oh, it just taking you. It took you from the main category to the sub category.

118
00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:12.059
> P14: So I mean this. What that breaks it down is probably gonna either give you the answer or break it down to something smaller.

119
00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.419
Good name.

120
00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:19.119
> P14: I would I would, I would never do this, but I'll do it for this.

121
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.060
Becky: Got it? Well, why would you never do this?

122
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:30.739
> P14: Because, like I said, it's taking you through all of these different categories. But I know I need to make an appointment. I'm gonna call and make an appointment.

123
00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:37.489
> P14: What's up the sunny and and do the appointment through the I'm gonna sign in and do it through.

124
00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.790
> P14: The site. I'm not going through no topics and all that stuff. No

125
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.360
Becky: got it.

126
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:50.909
> P14: cause first we got hold forever with the Va. Anyway. So all extra time, -hmm.

127
00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.179
> P14: it's not happening.

128
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:58.630
Becky: Yeah. So it seems like at this point. It seems like, a long process.

129
00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.129
> P14: Yes, it is. Yes.

130
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:15.890
Becky: yeah. I'm curious. What if you had a different question. So what if you had a question about a new law that was passed. Would you use this tool to answer that sort of question, or just a different question?

131
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:21.070
> P14: Hmm.

132
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.499
> P14: but I use this particular thing, this one?

133
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.829
Becky: Yes, just from what you've seen so far.

134
00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:33.220
> P14: If I wanted to know, yeah, I would just probably put it in the search.

135
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:38.829
> P14: But actually, I probably not. I probably would just Google it, because Google will give you the answer

136
00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.169
> P14: faster than going through. No.

137
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.289
> P14: I would. I'll probably Google, it

138
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:48.919
> P14: got it. Okay. So it sounds like, Yup, Yup.

139
00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.879
Becky: yeah, no, that's really helpful to understand just your

140
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:57.830
Becky: other methods. You would take to get your question answered.

141
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:59.400
> P14: yeah.

142
00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:07.990
Becky: alright. So, just moving through this flow, you've selected audiology and hearing aids go ahead and select. Continue.

143
00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.739
Becky: And now, can you show me what you would do on this page?

144
00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.690
> P14: Okay, this one, my own benefits.

145
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.629
if I cause you said I need to make an appointment, so it would be my own.

146
00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:32.239
Becky: Got it so sounds like because you need to make an appointment. Then you would choose my own benefits.

147
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:41.840
Becky: Can you talk through some, maybe some other cases where you would choose where you might choose someone else's BA benefits? Or it's a general question.

148
00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:45.680
> P14: Okay, I would choose someone else's va benefit.

149
00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:47.639
If I was looking at my father.

150
00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:49.190
Becky: Hmm, okay.

151
00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:51.110
yeah.

152
00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:55.789
Becky: Got it. And when would you choose? It's a general question.

153
00:15:58.430 --> 00:16:03.289
> P14: Never cause. I don't have no general question for this.

154
00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:04.390
Nope

155
00:16:05.630 --> 00:16:12.059
Becky: audit. Alright. No, that makes sense. So you've chosen my own Va. Benefits. Let's go ahead and click.

156
00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:13.990
Becky: continue here.

157
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:22.140
Becky: and before clicking on anything. How much longer do you think this formid?

158
00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.710
> P14: What did you say?

159
00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:30.330
Becky: How much longer do you think the form is to complete at this point.

160
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:40.909
> P14: Well, we done did a lot of clicking, and we just on 2 or 4, so I would think we got 2 more, but we probably got more than 2 more.

161
00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:49.299
Becky: Got it all right. Well, we'll see if your instincts are correct. I see you notice the the 204 right at the top.

162
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:57.340
> P14: Yes, and we've done. We've more than twice, so I don't know what that part as well

163
00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.769
> P14: got it.

164
00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:07.149
> P14: I guess it waste until you get into the actual meeting. What you wanna do for start counting.

165
00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:16.310
Becky: do you? So it sounds like, maybe you're unclear on how the the numbers are changing right now at the top.

166
00:17:17.339 --> 00:17:18.270
Yes.

167
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:37.310
Becky: got it. That that makes sense to me. Like you said you've been doing a lot of clicking, and it says 2 or 4. So you know something's not adding up there. Can you tell me what you do on this page. Now, considering your again, your scenario is, you want to get your hearing checked

168
00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:40.589
> P14: to say something?

169
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:49.829
> P14: I guess I have a question. That's the only thing that makes sense. which I don't have a question. It's not a question. It's about

170
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.979
> P14: making an appointment. That's not a question.

171
00:17:55.270 --> 00:18:05.589
Becky: Hmm! So are you saying you're or let let me know if this sounds right. Are you saying you're choosing? I have question because you don't see

172
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.469
Becky: I have an appointment. Maybe

173
00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:20.189
> P14: right. I don't see anything else that fits the category. So I mean, okay, say something nice. Complain about some suggestion. A town hall.

174
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.500
> P14: I want to say something else.

175
00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.659
> P14: Yeah.

176
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.740
Becky: got it. So you're just trying to find the the option that fits the best.

177
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.300
> P14: Yes.

178
00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:36.729
Becky: got it. And and why do you think Va is asking you this question right now.

179
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:42.260
> P14: because they wanna provide the instructions to you.

180
00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:50.410
Becky: Okay. that makes sense. Let's go ahead and click. I have a question, and then we'll hit. Continue.

181
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.210
Okay?

182
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:06.619
Becky: So again, you're you're gonna find. This is, gonna be pretty repetitive. But without clicking anything. Can you tell me what you do on this page as you're looking at it.

183
00:19:07.290 --> 00:19:12.970
> P14: Put put your question, in which I don't have a question, but I guess I'll put the question in.

184
00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:17.399
Becky: yeah, why do you say you don't have a question in this scenario?

185
00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.970
> P14: Because you said you supposed to be clicking on it to make an appointment

186
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.509
> P14: not to see how to make an appointment.

187
00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:33.530
Becky: Got it so so what would you do on this page if you need to make an appointment.

188
00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:37.720
The

189
00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.380
I guess I would ask the question, how do you make an appointment for audiology

190
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:44.990
> P14: which is dumb, but

191
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:49.900
Becky: got it? So you just type in that question.

192
00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.180
Yes.

193
00:19:54.640 --> 00:20:10.760
Becky: alright. So we can actually type anything into the box using this prototype. But we'll pretend, like you type in the question about what you mentioned before. How can I get an appointment to get my hearing checked or audiology? And we'll just hit. Continue.

194
00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:11.980
> P14: Okay?

195
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.729
> P14: Oh, they finally moved to number 3 after.

196
00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.700
> P14: Oh, wow, okay.

197
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.249
Becky: yes, yes. So have you been keeping track of the the bar at the top?

198
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.450
Yeah.

199
00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.340
Becky: Alright.

200
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:39.909
Becky: Well, yeah. So we we moved into 3 or 4 now and again, without clicking on anything described to me what you do on this page here, after reading through the question.

201
00:20:40.930 --> 00:20:44.609
Okay, I'm the veteran. So I would choose. I'm the veteran.

202
00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:52.929
Becky: Alright, so can you tell me why you think Va is asking you this question here.

203
00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:58.489
> P14: So wait. Well.

204
00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:04.930
> P14: I don't know. I guess they just want to know who doing it or something. I don't know.

205
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.320
Becky: Okay.

206
00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:19.249
Becky: no, that's fair that maybe it's not. You're not clear on the exact reason why, but maybe it sounds like they want to know who's filling out the form that's your. Is that your best? Guess

207
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.610
ye? Yes. And who you fill in at the phone at the form for?

208
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.860
Becky: Hmm.

209
00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.430
Becky: yeah. So in this.

210
00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:30.100
> P14: Oh, sorry. Go ahead.

211
00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:36.180
> P14: So being that it's me it'll be I'm the veteran. But if I was doing it for my father output, I'm a family member of the veteran

212
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:43.939
Becky: got it. Yeah, it sounds like you. You see the distinction between the 2 options. Here.

213
00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:51.939
Becky: let's go ahead in this scenario and choose. I'm the veteran and hit continue, since you're trying to get your your hearing chat.

214
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:54.040
Umhm.

215
00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:03.069
Becky: Okay? And just to confirm on that last question, too, is is your dad, also a veteran?

216
00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:04.000
> P14: Yes.

217
00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:05.310
Becky: oh, please.

218
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:09.790
Becky: And I'm his power attorney. So I'm his power attorney. So I do this

219
00:22:09.810 --> 00:22:12.000
> P14: all the time for him and me. Yeah.

220
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:17.829
Becky: Oh, okay, that that relationships clearer I wasn't sure. So I just wanted to make sure.

221
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:19.110
Yep.

222
00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:28.740
Becky: that alright and same question here, what would you do? And why is they asking you this question?

223
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:42.630
> P14: You know II would say I would answer, no, but I don't know why they're answering, asking this because it doesn't matter whether you work there or not, you still should get the same answer. That's why I know I wouldn't use this.

224
00:22:44.050 --> 00:22:51.940
Becky: Yeah, that's that's an interesting perspective. So you're not sure why they would ask you this question.

225
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:53.660
> P14: No.

226
00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:59.550
> P14: they've never asked me this question.

227
00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.260
> P14: All my years they've never asked me if I worked at a BA.

228
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:12.620
Becky: Oh, okay. So in other experiences, this. So this is a new question that you haven't had asked asked of you before.

229
00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:13.740
> P14: Correct?

230
00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:21.529
Becky: Okay, no, that's really interesting to to hear about. So that's why maybe this question is sort of throwing you off here.

231
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:28.529
Becky: In the scenario. You you're not the Va employee, so let's go ahead and select no, and hit. Continue

232
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:49.089
Becky: alright. So on this page there are. You'll see there are a lot of different fields, and we're not gonna actually type anything in here but instead, take a look at all the questions. And I'd like to know if any question stands out to you.

233
00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:56.340
> P14: No.

234
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:07.999
Becky: alright and looking through all the questions, is there any information that you would not like to give to Va.

235
00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:11.529
Is it? What now?

236
00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:17.870
Becky: Just after looking through all the questions, is there anything that you wouldn't want to

237
00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.820
Becky: provide in this form, or or send to the Va.

238
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:30.799
Becky: Or are you comfortable with completing everything and and giving all this? Information that that the form is asking for?

239
00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.549
> P14: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

240
00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.569
Becky: oh, sorry. Could you repeat that? I think you you broke up a little

241
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.329
> P14: was that a, yes, yes.

242
00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:47.210
> P14: Okay.

243
00:24:47.940 --> 00:25:02.669
Becky:  alright and looking at one of the fields up above, around social security. I noticed that it asks for social security or service number. What do you think that means there.

244
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:12.050
> P14: Oh, yeah, yeah. Cause some people got a service number for people that's like Vietnam and all that kind of stuff way back when they got service numbers.

245
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:13.749
Some people do

246
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:21.130
Becky: got it. And in this case, does it seem like you'd provide both of the numbers or just one of the numbers.

247
00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:23.530
Just one cause. I don't have a service number.

248
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:24.820
Becky: Okay?

249
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:32.800
> P14: Got it. So it sounds like you. You understand the difference between social security number and service number.

250
00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:39.029
Becky: alright. So we'll pretend, like you filled in the information on this page and hit continue.

251
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:48.559
> P14: Hello, okay, can't continue.

252
00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.650
Becky: Thank you.

253
00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.179
Becky: And can you describe this new page that you're on right now.

254
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:00.310
> P14: Okay.

255
00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:09.690
> P14:  okay, facility. My grandbabies call my phone.

256
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.850
> P14: Yeah. You gotta put in a Va here. Va.

257
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:22.620
> P14: and what do you think? Search by name means, and search by location?

258
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:33.300
> P14: You either can put in the name of the facility or the location of the facility I would think.

259
00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:41.099
Becky: Got it. And just in your personal experience. What would you do first to search for your health facility here?

260
00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.879
> P14: I'm putting a name, because I know the name.

261
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:50.710
Becky: Okay? And and how do you know the name? Is that just because you've been there before, or you've had previous experience.

262
00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:55.270
> P14: Yeah, cause I go there all the time I go to the same one. We only have one

263
00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:05.580
Becky: got it. Okay. that makes sense to me. So for today, we're just going to pretend like your health facility. It starts with the word James.

264
00:27:05.690 --> 00:27:13.689
Becky: And again, we can't type. But if you click inside the box. We'll pretend that you typed in the word, James, since you know your health facility, James.

265
00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:20.559
> P14: And what are you seeing here now on all the different facilities that start with the word James

266
00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:31.240
Becky: alright. And let's take it one step further. Let's say your health facility is called James J. Peters. Can you show me what you do next? Here.

267
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.490
> P14: Ango Peters.

268
00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:36.560
click it

269
00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:48.219
Becky: alright. So it sounds like, or just repeating back what you did. You click, James J. Peters. And now the it's showing up here is selected.

270
00:27:48.530 --> 00:27:51.160
Becky: Can you show me what you do next on this page?

271
00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.570
Continue

272
00:27:55.790 --> 00:27:56.980
Becky: right.

273
00:27:59.830 --> 00:28:05.149
Becky: and and just curious. What is the name of your facility that you usually go to

274
00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.060
hunch of Holmes Maguire VA Medical center

275
00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:12.710
Becky: was that [full name of health facility including Veteran name].

276
00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.860
Becky: Yes, okay, got it

277
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:27.569
Becky: cool. Yeah. Just curious on how you how you remember the name of your facility, since I know the names can be pretty long, and and can also change too. So it's really interesting to to hear.

278
00:28:29.650 --> 00:28:39.540
Becky: Alright. So now on this page, I just wanna check in and and pause for a second. How much longer do you think this form is? At this point?

279
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:45.710
> P14: It has to be longer, because all those questions we still own number 3. I got it. Okay.

280
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.299
Becky: you've done. You've done a lot of clicks.

281
00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:50.360
Becky: and it's still

282
00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.210
> P14: still on Number 3,

283
00:28:53.080 --> 00:29:02.299
Becky: yeah. And if you compare this form to similar ones that you filled out in the past? Does it feel longer, shorter, the same

284
00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:03.400
> P14: longer.

285
00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.080
Becky: longer? Okay?

286
00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:12.919
Becky: And what? Curious? On? What type of forms are you thinking about, or are you comparing this form to?

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:22.389
> P14: What this form is? Just to ask a question? I mean, why would you go through all this to ask the question. You could pick up the phone and call somebody

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:28.850
Becky: was our go ahead.

289
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.780
I wouldn't need it at all.

Becky: Hmm! I see it sounds like

294
00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:59.790
> P14: So you think the the form is longer than previous ones, and then that there are there might be faster ways to

295
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.010
Becky: make an appointment.

296
00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.530

Becky: phone. And and why is that

304
00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:45.660
> P14: because

306
00:30:50.290 --> 00:30:53.519
> P14: phone is talk to somebody and get it all done at one time.

307
00:30:54.100 --> 00:31:07.620
Becky: Hmm, so I'm I'm hearing a theme that you maybe prefer like a quicker resolution. And phone is usually the best way to do that in your case.  got it?

Becky: Well, today, we're going to pretend like, you actually prefer getting your answer in the us, mail, so

00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.910
> P14: and especially from the VA. You're not gonna get it no time soon.

314
00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.619

315
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:44.759
Becky: got it. Yeah. So it sounds like it's just too long. And and you wouldn't choose us mail.

316
00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:47.670
> P14: Oh. no, Umhm

317

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:54.550
Becky: Alright. Let's go ahead and click, continue and see what's on. The next page here.

> P14: Okay, and we still on number 3.

320
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:09.519
Becky: Yeah. So it seems sounds like you're still, you know, still referring to the the pro progress bar at the top there, and seeing that the numbers not changing

321
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:13.319
Becky: on this page. What would you do here?

322
00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:27.050
> P14: Hmm! I guess I was just selecting and see what country they had, whether United States was in there. Oh.

323
00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.010
> P14: yeah.

324
00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:39.870
Becky: alright and what do you think it means where it says, at the top I receive mail outside of the United States on a Us. Military base.

325
00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:44.409
Let's see if I was on

326
00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.710
> P14: at a base that wasn't in United States. But I was overseas.

327
00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:56.349
Becky: Alright! Alright! That's helpful to hear your understanding of just that check box at the top.

328
00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:04.039
Becky: So for today, for today, we're just going to choose United States in the dropdown like you mentioned and hit continue.

okay.

331
00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.289
Becky: alright. Now, here, is there anything that stands out to you on this page?

332
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:27.790
> P14: No, I'm just asking me to put my mailing address in here. Let's be

337
00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:09.810
at this rate? II don't know. I don't know.

338
00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:16.490
Becky: Got it. Okay. And what makes you unsure, or or that you don't know?

339
00:34:17.409 --> 00:34:21.869
Oh, because I mean, we've we went through a whole lot, and we still had moved to Number 4,

340
00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:22.999
> P14: so I mean.

341
00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.699
> P14: I would never do. I would never do this, never, ever.

342
00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:38.729
Becky: I know that that's fair. Yeah. And it seems like you're really keeping track of that progress far, and seeing if the numbers are changing and you're not so, it makes you.

343
00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:43.860
> P14: Yeah, cause III mean, II hate wasted time this and

345
00:34:50.659 --> 00:35:01.350
Becky: Interesting? Okay, yeah. Let's Let's take a look at this page, and then we'll move on to the next one. But I do. Wanna ask you. What do you think this page is asking for

346
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.500
Becky: here.

347
00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:09.670
> P14: To make sure your address is correct.

348
00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:13.499
> P14: and they're saying they don't. It doesn't recognize what

349
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:18.409
> P14: you put in. So it's telling you what it should be a quarter of the mail.

350
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:24.679
Becky: Got it? And understanding that, what would you do on the page?

351
00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:28.270
> P14: select the one that they suggested.

352
00:35:28.690 --> 00:35:34.959
Becky: Okay. And and why would you select the one they suggest, and not the one you entered?

353
00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:37.930
> P14: Because, Umhm.

354
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:44.620
9 times out of 10 days. What it suggested one is the right for delivery with the postal service. So.

355
00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:53.519
Becky: okay, so it sounds like, you you trust what they are suggesting there, in that it's right for the postal service.

356
00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:59.120
Becky: So that makes sense to me. Yeah, let's go ahead and click, continue and see what's on the next page.

357
00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:06.899

00:36:08.890 --> 00:36:13.220
Becky: Oh, yeah, I saw you clicked on it, too. Is it not moving for you?

359
00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.650

Becky: Let's look at the category and topic box right at the top first. So how would you open that?

378
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.219

Becky: what is indicating to you that you? You can't update it

388
00:38:10.050 --> 00:38:14.620

Okay? Hold on 1 s.

401
00:39:22.390 --> 00:39:25.680
A phone number. Okay? So I would click on edit by contact information

Becky: Does it look like you can edit all of your contact information.

405
00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:46.250
Just those 2,

406
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.550

407
00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:56.090
Becky: Alright. And what makes you think you can edit just those 2?

408
00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:59.070
> P14: I'm not cold, but you can get.

409
00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.380
Do you need to be killed?

410
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:01.939
> P14: Yeah. And so

411
00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:03.839
I don't think so.

Thank you. That's for sure.

419
00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:38.010
> P14: Okay, thank you so much. Alright. You have a good evening. Thank you.

420
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:49.579

Becky: Alright. No worries

422
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:58.819
> P14: Trying to remember what I last asked. Oh, I think I asked. Oh, yes, maybe well, I would make the changes that

423
00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:05.459
Becky: yes. And how do you? Or why do you think you can only make changes to those 2 boxes there.

424
00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:13.360
> P14: because th, that's the the edit that I hit, and though well, those 2 boxes are the only thing that's

425
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:15.880
> P14: in that area.

426
00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.780
But when I click the edit

427
00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:22.979
Becky: got it? And does it look like you can change your contact preference here.

428
00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.800
> P14: Content? Alchemy?

429
00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:31.759
> P14: Okay. How should we contact you? No, you can't change that.

430
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:34.620
Becky: Okay. And

431
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:42.089
Becky: It appeared after you click the edit button. So what makes you think you can't change this question here?

432
00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.470
> P14: Oh, because they don't give you a box to make the correction.

433
00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:52.179
Becky: Got it. Okay? So it sounds like the box is telling you that you can. You can update the information.

434
00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.320
> P14: Correct.

435
00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:55.920
Becky: Audit.

436
00:41:56.250 --> 00:42:03.490
Becky: Alright, let's go click, cancel. Let's say you actually put in your phone number correctly. So you don't actually need to update it.

437
00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:09.530
Becky: And now we're ready to submit. So you can go ahead and click, submit question at the very bottom.

438
00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.890
> P14: Submit question

439
00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.480
> P14: by here. Okay.

440
00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:30.109
Becky: Alright. Now take a minute to read this page, and then can you summarize it back to me. or just anything that you're noticing on the page?

441
00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:34.010
Yeah, it said that it was submitted successfully, and it gave me a reference number.

442
00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.639
> P14: Now, I'm saying, okay.

443
00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.159
you should receive a reply within the US. Mail

444
00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.880
> P14: within 7 business days. Oh.

445
00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.429
> P14: Nope, okay.

446
00:42:50.730 --> 00:42:55.409
Becky: got it. And and why do you say that around the 7 business days?

447
00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:02.330
> P14: That's too long. I mean, if you need an appointment. You got to wait 7 days to get the answer.

448
00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.280
and it's still not making an appointment.

449
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:16.620
Becky: Got it? Hmm! Let me ask you a different question. Is there any other type of question

450
00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:24.579
Becky: that that you would be able to wait longer for, or any scenario where you would be okay with waiting longer for?

451
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:31.860
> P14:  no! Well, the only thing that you that you're required to wait long.

452
00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:40.060
> P14: Yes, take it could take anywhere from 2 to 3 months to years.

453
00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:46.900
> P14: So that's all thing you require. You're required to wait, and you can't control that weight. You're just in a PAL somewhere.

454
00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:57.760
Becky: Got it. But if you just had just like a general question about something. would you wait, or would this wait time? Be okay with you?

455
00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:07.850
> P14: Well, probably so. But I can't see me having a just a general question for the Va. Okay?

456
00:44:07.990 --> 00:44:13.069
> P14: If it's a if it's a general question, I will look it up. I would I would look it up.

457
00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:18.530
Becky: got it as opposed to like a more specific question.

458
00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.190
Oof! Well.

459
00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:31.249
this this what I don't understand? There's no specific question that you cannot call the Va. For and get an answer.

460
00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:35.590
Becky: Got it.

461
00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:44.040
> P14: So I would never complete this form and do this? Never. no. never! Yeah.

462
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:50.280
Becky: And what number would you call, or who would you call? Is it the 800 number, or or another number?

463
00:44:50.480 --> 00:45:03.919
> P14: No, if it was, if it's a question about my in an appointment, or something like that. I would call my actual v. 8, because this 800 number is, if you want to know about your disability, your payments.

464
00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:07.100
> P14: they they can't help you, for with appointments

465
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:15.660
Becky: got it. And how would you? Look up that specific number if you needed to

466
00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.929
> P14: if I needed to look it up.

467
00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:23.129
Becky: Yeah. Or do you already remember the number?

468
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:26.070
> P14: Oh, sorry. Go ahead. Oh, yes, yeah, 6, 7,

469
00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.779
(804) 675-5000.

470
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:31.409
Becky: Oh, okay, so you're over the number.

471
00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:41.880
> P14: Oh, yeah. Cause like, I said, we have. We have a huge Va, but it's one Va. In Richmond, Virginia, one VA. For us

472
00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:43.860
> P14: that everybody goes to.

473
00:45:45.010 --> 00:45:50.019
> P14: And it's one phone number that everybody call. And then once you call you dial, your extension

474
00:45:50.980 --> 00:46:00.210
Becky: had it. Okay? So yeah, sounds like, you have a lot of experience calling the number. You even remember the phone number. So you wouldn't even have to look it up at this point.

475
00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:01.230
> P14: -Oh.

476
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:03.620
Becky: alright.

477
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:08.520
Becky: so we've we've come to the end of this form.

478
00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.200
Becky: And you've read through the

479
00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:18.049
Becky: the last page here. Is there anything else that you'd want to know after you submit your question.

480
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:22.570
> P14: Umhm.

481
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:24.930
> P14: No.

482
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.680
Becky: alright.

483
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:44.749
Becky: Okay. So we're we're finished with the prototype you can stop sharing your screen, or or if you just want to keep it up. That's fine, too. But I'd love to spend a little time just reflecting on everything we talked about before we finish.

484
00:46:45.430 --> 00:46:54.039
Becky: And you know you've already shared some of your opinions on this. But if we just think further about asking the a question online.

485
00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.359
Becky:  was there anything at all that you liked about that process?

486
00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.330
I did not like this process at all.

487
00:47:03.830 --> 00:47:04.819
> P14: I did not

488
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:07.480
Becky: got it. And and why was that?

489
00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.090
Because it's it's it's

490
00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:17.219
> P14: it was first of all it was too lengthy to do. And at the end result not get an answer.

491
00:47:17.650 --> 00:47:18.990
Becky: So no.

492
00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:21.590
> P14: and have to stay awake.

493
00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:26.289
> P14: There's nothing that you should want to know at the Va. That you should have to wait for. If it's a question.

494
00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:30.000
> P14: you know, this is too easy. It's too easy to pick up the phone and call.

495
00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:38.589
Becky: Got it. That's really interesting, you said. There's nothing at the view that you should have to wait for. If you have a question

496
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:40.099
Becky: why do you say that?

497
00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:55.569
> P14: Because that's what they I mean. That's what they have the hundreds of workers. Therefore, I mean, I work for. I work for the Federal government. But and people, are gonna they not gonna wait for? No, no, they're gonna pick up their phone and call me if they need some, or they need something from my people. They're gonna call me

498
00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:57.339
> P14: and and get the answer

499
00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.940
> P14: because

500
00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:05.509
Becky: had it. And just thinking in the

501
00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:16.950
Becky: about the form again, is there anything that could be easier. Besides not using the form and and calling someone. Is there just anything that could be easier within the form?

502
00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:22.130
> P14: Yes, they could put more on a page than 2 things

503
00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:28.980
Becky: got it. And and why do you think that would make things easier?

504
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:36.490
> P14: Because you would? You would. First of all, you wouldn't have to keep on clicking and going from page to page. And he's talking about

505
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:43.069
> P14: one or 4, and you click 5 tag 5 different pages before even moves to number 2

506
00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:55.559
Becky: got it. And you know, you mentioned contacting the online before. like, how does that experience compare to this one?

507
00:48:55.730 --> 00:49:03.540
> P14: Oh, it's easy. It's a pay, it's a sheet, and you just fill it all out and hit. Submit. You don't go through all these little manor.

508
00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:09.479
> P14: page by page by page. You just fill out what you want to fill out and hit, submit, and it goes on.

509
00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.139
Becky: Got it? And and what's the sheet you're referring to

510
00:49:13.650 --> 00:49:32.969
> P14: any any I don't see. I don't have a funny instance. I mean, I've I just never had a something like this. You gotta go through all this thing to get something. Oh, well, and then, first of all, you could do okay. If you wanna do secure messaging you to your doctor or to audiology. You just send a message to them, and they come back with you with us.

511
00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:43.570
> P14: So that's another reason why I wouldn't use this I would go straight through secure messaging, and because you can contact any department that you've dealt with. it's there their name, their name.

512
00:49:44.020 --> 00:50:06.100
> P14: name, the doctor's name. Everything is there, and you select you only do it. Everything's on one page. You put you put at the top. You put the provider area, or whatever area you trying to get like. If I'm trying to get audiology, I was select audiology. It'll add it. And your subject is, they got choices. Your subject is either appointment, prescriptions, general question.

513
00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:22.410
> P14: You select it, you type your stuff and they respond to you within a day. Mort. If you do it early enough. They're they're respond to you before the day is over with depending on what the doctor. When the doctor finishes their patients they check them. It checks secure messaging, and they respond back to you.

514
00:50:22.490 --> 00:50:24.230
> P14: or they have the nurse to do it.

515
00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:37.450
Becky: Got it? So yeah, sounds like there, I'm glad you mentioned secure messaging and I don't wanna make any assumptions. So this might sound like like an obvious question. But

516
00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:41.200
Becky: And you mentioned all the differences. But what exactly

517
00:50:41.470 --> 00:50:57.539
> P14: do you think makes it better than this experience that you just went through like you mentioned your doctor. And oh, sorry! Go ahead. Secure messaging. It goes directly to that department, and the department looks up your information cause they have it already, and they come back to you

518
00:50:58.350 --> 00:50:59.180
> P14: like.

519
00:50:59.780 --> 00:51:08.990
> P14: like, for instance, if I go to my primary care, doctor, like I just did, because my one of my prescriptions is finished. I don't have any more refills. So I went to him.

520
00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:22.150
> P14: and I sent it to him, and my subject was prescription was medication refill. That's one of the subjects. So I click that. And then I typed in the name of the medicine, and that all my refills was finished. And can he put in

521
00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:23.500
> P14: new refills.

522
00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:28.609
> P14: or do I need to wait to be seen at my next appointment in April.

523
00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:31.179
> P14: and he'll come back, and he'll tell me whether

524
00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:37.000
> P14: he'll say I feel your medication, or he'll say, wait! I'll see you in April.

525
00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:44.200
Becky: Got it so it sounds like you really understand the process to

526
00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:48.469
Becky: through secure messaging to get those health care questions, answered

527
00:51:48.690 --> 00:52:04.549
Becky:  And I might ask this before. But maybe I'm just trying to to understand, like for other questions that don't have to do with healthcare. Would you like you mentioned Googling? Would you go to that? 800 number? What

528
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:06.599
Becky: for those other questions?

529
00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:14.860
> P14: It would depend on my question, because, like I said, the 800 number is not there to. I mean, they're there to answer questions, but certain questions they won't answer.

530
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.930
> P14: So

531
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:22.409
> P14: you, you just know to go to the VA. To your Va. To get the answer

532
00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:27.350
> P14: office something in general like when, like

533
00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:43.560
> P14:  when is the last day to apply for the under the Pack Act. You could Google that. And it's out there to tell you what the date is and that it had got extended. So it's easier ways to find answers, then to like that phone? Hmm.

534
00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:49.540
> P14: and wait 7 business days for an answer that you could have gotten 10 min. Right?

535
00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:54.830
Becky: Yeah. So sounds like, maybe just in the questions that you can think of asking

536
00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:58.670
Becky: just in in your personal experience that

537
00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:04.470
Becky: you you might just Google. Or you know, if you have health questions, you know where to go to?

538
00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:08.980
Becky:  yeah, you can't. Or

539
00:53:09.090 --> 00:53:19.619
Becky: yeah. So there are no scenarios where you might want to call like the 800 number, or just unlike you mentioned using the chat bot as well. What was that scenario for?

540
00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:26.850
> P14: Okay, the chat bot! It was that I wanted to know the status of my claim that I had submitted because it was showing.

541
00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:30.749
> P14: Yeah, it was showing that it was completed, but it hadn't rolled over to

542
00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:40.149
> P14: meaning actually see it. But and it and they on the chat box. It tells you that it says that they it will give you on time.

543
00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:42.730
> P14: Information.

544
00:53:43.530 --> 00:53:44.520
Becky: Saudi Arabia.

545
00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:45.660
> P14: Yeah.

546
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:58.699
Becky: Yeah. So it sounds like, you know about just other tools and ways to get answers quicker. So that that makes sense to me. And thanks for humoring these

547
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.119
Becky: these questions. For me, too.

548
00:54:02.300 --> 00:54:03.310
you're welcome.

549
00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:06.529
Becky: Alright, so

550
00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:33.100
Becky: I don't have any further questions. I just wanted to thank you for sharing your time with me. It's been really helpful to learn from you, and just to go through the whole prototype and and watch you interact with it. While you know, going through your your feedback as well. So I really appreciate that and I do. Wanna ask if you have any questions for me. That you'd that you'd like answered right now.

551
00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.130
> P14: No. I'm good.

552
00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:53.599
Becky: Alright. Well, thank you so much for your time. Pera, Jean is going to send you a thank you. Note. Oh, thank you. So they're gonna send you a thank you. Note, with some information, you can pass this along to other veterans if they want to participate in future research sessions.

553
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:54.980
> P14: And

554
00:54:55.970 --> 00:55:00.140
Becky: great. Yeah, that's it for me. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

555
00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:04.790
> P14: You, too, thank you. Alright, thanks, Terry. Bye. bye.
