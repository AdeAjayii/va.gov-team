Research study: [Submit an inquiry (Round 1)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/research/Submit%20an%20inquiry/Round%201)

## Transcript

Tyler: Alright, the recording has started. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

P4: Yes I am.

Tyler: Alright, we breezed through that. But before we look at the prototype, I want to get to know you and your experience with VA services a little bit better. How long have you been a Veteran?

P4: How long have I been a Veteran? Since 1988.

Tyler: Did you start interacting with the VA right after you got out of service?

P4: No. It was about 10 years after I got out of the service. I hadn't used any of my VA benefits up to that point. I decided to get some health care through the VA.

Tyler: So you're enrolled in health care?

P4: Yes.

Tyler: Okay. And have you ever contacted the VA online or over the phone?

P4: Yes. I contact the VA online a couple times a month I would guess.

Tyler: How do you ususally contact them?

P4: Through MHV. I use secure messaging online.

Tyler: Awesome. I might have some more questions for you about that, as the session continues.

P4: If I can throw in an aside, if this is going to help logging in then I am all for it. Because to get into MHV is becoming a nightmare.

Tyler: Ah right. Yeah we won't cover that in detail today but what we'll do is, I'll save a bit of time at the end so we can talk more about sign in. I'm guessing you're talking about the way the sign in on MHV has changed, and there's different options now?

P4: Yeah there's like 8 different options. And they intertwine and they're very, very difficult to use.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. I hear you. I don't think you're along in having that experience.

Tyler: Let's go ahead and get ourselves set up now with this prototype.

[Setting up the prototype]

3:00

P4: I got it! Ask VA.

[Setting up screen share]

Tyler: Now I can see your screen too. I can see what you're seeing. I'm seeing a tab on your screen that says Ask VA.

Tyler: The first thing I'm hoping we can do is, you can take a moment to look at this page. And then tell me what you're noticing first.

P4: What I notice first is sign in or create an account if you have questions about education benefits. Is there going to be a separate window like that for other benefits? Other than educational?

Tyler: That's a good question. I'm not going to answer it yet. But it sounds like you're seeing this box and it says if your question is about education, you would go here. But if you have a question about something else it's not clear where to go. Is that right?

P4: Exactly.

Tyler: Is there anything else you can use this page for?

P4: Account creation. Is someone is not part of or signed into the VA.

Tyler: Right. So you can create an account or sign in to ask your question.

P4: It also looks as if you need to have an account to ask a question. Which I don't agree with. It might be someone who is not eligible or has a desire to create an account, that has a question. For example, my wife might want to know something about medical or death benefits and she does not have an account. And she may not want to login on mine.

Tyler: That's a great point. So automatically a little frustrated that it seems like you need to sign in. And you thought about your wife asking a question. That's super helfpul

Tyler. For the rest of our conversation we're going to imagine that you need to ask the VA a question about how to get your hearing checked. You've recently noticed some problems with your hearing and you don't know how to get your hearing checked.

6:32

Tyler: Without clicking anything yet, can you tell me what you would do first?

P4: Using this screen? 

Tyler: Yes please.

P4: I would sign in to my account. And I would probably use the messenger to contact my primary care physician and ask him about scheduling a hearing test.

Tyler: So with your experience of using SM to talk to your doctor, that's where you would go. That's clear.

Tyler: Let's have a look at the rest of the page. What are you reading?

P4: Signing for the best experience. What's the best way to do things. I'm assuming.

Tyler: What are the benefits of signing in?

P4: It will auto fill in info.

Tyler: Does it seem like you need to sign in?

P4: Yes. There's a little underneath contact without signing in. So, no, you don't have to.

8:15

Tyler: So at the very beginning, we talked about how, if you have a question about education benefits, it's pretty clear what you need to do. But your question is about getting your hearing checked, so where do you go?

P4: I would sign in to MHV. And use SM.

Tyler: Okay. What if I said, in this pretend world, SM didn't exist, and you could only use this page. What would you do? It's okay if the answer is I don't know.

P4: I don't know. I would call the Need help number.

Tyler: That's helpful. We're going to click on continue without signing in.

Tyler: Now we're on a new page. I'll give you a minute to look at this. And can you show me what you would do first on this page?

P4: I would click on Category (opens select menu).

Tyler: With this quesiton, which category would you choose?

P4: Health care.

Tyler: That felt pretty straightforward.

P4: Yeah.

Tyler: How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

P4: Very very. It's important because, to go through this list, this is everything available on the VA website. And I'm assuming this isn't all inclusive or this is a prototype, but, health care is the number one importance to 99% of Vets that sign in to this. Because it's something we all utilize and need.

Tyler: Why do you think it's important that you answer the question correctly?

P4: Because you're going to go off in some other branch of the VA information site and get lost, which I have done in the past.

Tyler: Okay. It's going to lead you down a path, and you want to make sure you go down the right path?

P4: You keep hitting continue and trying to get where you want to go and you can't get there. And then you need to start all over again which can be frustrating.

11:47

Tyler: That makes sense. Let's go ahead and click continue.

P4: Okay, so that breaks it down.

Tyler: Are you comparing this to the last page?

P4: Yes, this is a finer targeting than just health care. It's the health care, or areas of health care that people would ask about. And I'm assuming this is going to be a bigger list in the final version? Because there's a lot of other things that we would ask about. Pharmacy, appointments, primary care, vaccinations, I'm surprised Foreign Medical Program is even on there. There's a lot of other things that – if I was going to be drilling down through health care, I would like to see on there.

Tyler: So you interact with the VA health care quite a lot, especially using MHV. And this in comparison doesn't feel like it's covering everything. That's really good feedback. 

Tyler: With our scenario today, what would you choose on this page?

P4: Audiology and hearing aids.

Tyler: Okay, that felt pretty quick to choose an option.

13:49

Tyler: What if you couldn't find an option to fit you needs?

P4: Call the 800 number.

Tyler: Would you ask them your question, or would you ask them how to use this online service?

P4: I would ask them how to find it. I prefer a visual means of getting to my answer. Vs. just hearing it. Especially if I'm hearing impaired, it would be difficult to hear on the phone.

Tyler: Okay, so you would call the 800 number hoping they would help you use this, and then you would continue online on your own?

P4: Yeah.

Tyler: Let's choose audiology and hearing aids and we'll click continue.

Tyler: As a reminder, your question is about how to get your hearing checked. What would you do on this page?

P4: Well I know that I qualify for having my hearing checked. So I would go my own VA benefits.

Tyler: Okay. So because you are already enrolled and qualify for this, you would choose my own VA benefits.

P4: Yes.

Tyler: Great. And can you imagine a scenario where you choose that 2nd option, someone elses benefits?

P4: No. I wouldn't. Maybe if my wife was logging in to find something out, especially seeing how she didn't log in to an account, there, I could see her looking for that.

Tyler: What about a general question?

P4: That would be if I wanted to – rather than speak to my doctor or my primary care – I might have a question like when are flue vacinnes going to be available, hwich would go to the nurse not the doctor.

Tyler: Right okay. So the more specific individual will answer your quesiton if you choose my own VA benefits, and a general question will be more 'overall.'

Tyler: Let's move on. 

Tyler: How much longer do you think the form will be, at this point?

P4: There's 2 more sections to it. It says 2 of 4. Your question. And you have the bar on top.

Tyler: You're looking at the bar and seeing that there are 2 more bars left. So 2 more pages.

P4: Yeah, after this one.

Tyler: That makes sense. Now let's look at this question. How would you answer this?

17:42

P4:
