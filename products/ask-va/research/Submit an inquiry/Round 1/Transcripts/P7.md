Research study: [Submit an inquiry (Round 1)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/research/Submit%20an%20inquiry/Round%201)

## Transcript

Tyler: Awesome. So are you okay with me recording my screen and audio today?

> P7: Yes, that's fine.

Tyler: Alrighty, thank you. So I think we got through all that intro bit. Before we jump into this prototype that we've got on the screen, I just wanna learn a little bit more about you. And your experience with the VA. How long have you been a Veteran?

> P7: So I'm a transitioning service member going through a Medical Retirement board. So not quite veteran status yet.

Tyler: Yeah, I think that'll be useful to have that perspective today. Have you ever contacted the VA?

> P7: Yes. So part of my medical retirement is submitting a claim. So I got assigned a VA rep that's working with me through this Medical board process.

Tyler: Okay, how did you get in touch with the VA when you first started the process?

> P7: It's just part of the process, like once the army kind of identifies you as not able to continue service because of the, you know, injury or illness that you have. It just kind of starts this process. So I got automatically assigned once I attended a briefing.

Tyler: Okay well, I mean, I'm excited to hear your perspective, because, you know, sometimes I talk to Veterans who have been Veterans for 30 years, and they've been in touch with the VA for a long time, so I think it'll be really great to have a different perspective from you.

Tyler: So we already have this prototype up on the screen, which is, which is helpful. And like I mentioned, this is not gonna work perfectly. So there's certain things we can't click on. But this is a way for us to learn what we need to improve before we share it with more Veterans.

Tyler: Okay, so we've got this up on your screen and we're not gonna click anything yet. But I'm gonna give you a moment to look at this page. You're welcome to scroll around if you like. And I'm wondering what you're noticing first?

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.239

> P7: The signing in portion. Since that's nice and bold.

Tyler: Okay, so we're noticing right away signing in, does it feel like you need to sign in on this page?

> P7: Yeah, I think so. Nice and bold, right in the middle there.

Tyler: Yeah. And what does this page let you do? So if you signed in what would you do after?

> P7: I'd just be able to send the question to the VA something that you know, you might want an answer to.

Tyler: That makes sense, alright.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.100

Tyler: And for the rest of our conversation we're gonna imagine that you have a question for the VA. So let's say that you recently had some problems with your hearing. And you wanted to ask the VA how to go about getting a hearing check. So you don't really know where to start. You know, you probably need to see an audiologist.

> P7: Okay.

Tyler: So without clicking anything yet, what would you do first?

> P7: Create an account.

Tyler: Okay, so that green button? Okay. And if your questions about your hearing or getting your hearing checked, does it feel like you need to sign in?

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:48.260

> P7:  I mean, I don't know, if there's a FAQ page... No.  Yeah, just it does kind of, like you wanna ask a question. You need to create account first.

Tyler: Yeah. That makes sense. Are there benefits to signing in?

> P7: I'm sure, you know. So that you have like a log of any communications that you send to the VA.

Tyler: Mmmm. And when we're looking at this page right now. So we're going to ask this question to the VA, after we sign in. How long do you think it's going to take to ask a question?

> P7: Hopefully, not too long. Probably creating the creating the account would take longer than just sending a question over.

Tyler: Awesome. Well, we're gonna scroll down a little bit, and I'm gonna show you a link that I don't think we've seen yet – which is really useful feedback for for me. So there's a link that says, continue without signing in.

Tyler: Yeah, I could see that was a little bit hidden.

> P7: It's not maximized on my screen. So I literally have to scroll down. And then, yeah, it's, you know, it's kind of subdued.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. That's really helpful feedback. So let's click on continue without signing in.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:49.450

Tyler: And like I mentioned, we're pretending like you need to ask the VA how to get your hearing checked. So with that in mind. Can you show me what you would do here?

> P7: Oh, I look at a category that probably, you know, fell under my question as close as possible. Healthcare. Let's see. Yeah, I think healthcare would be the closest.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Let's, you can go ahead and click on health care.

Tyler: Perfect. We'll stop here for a second. That felt really quick for you to choose healthcare. It looked like you were maybe going through like a process of elimination. Yeah, that makes sense. And how important did you think it was to answer that question correctly?

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:32.050

> P7: Probably important cause, you know, be pretty frustrating to go through, you know, category, like, oh, this is totally not what I'm looking for, and, you know, go down a rabbit hole trying to find...

Tyler: So you feel like you're gonna go down a path and you want to make sure you start on the right path.

Tyler: We're looking at this new screen. Now, can you show me what you would do on this page. We won't click, continue yet, but you can just begin by...

> P7: Click on audiology.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.790

Tyler: Okay so we chose audiology pretty quickly. How is this question different to the last one that we answered?

> P7: Oh, it's pretty specific.

Tyler: That makes sense. And we're seeing this gray box here. Can you describe that to me? What's that showing us? Just the category that we're under... health care.

Tyler: So it's kind of like the umbrella. And then there's more specific things underneath it that makes sense.

Tyler: What if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs on this page. What do you think you would do?

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:51.450

> P7: Probably go back and see if there's another category to look through.

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. Alright. Let's go ahead and click continue.

Tyler: Alright. So now we're looking at this new page, and you know we're still asking the VA how to get your hearing checked. What do you think you would do on this page?

> P7: My own VA benefits.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:21.459

Tyler: Do you feel a little bit uncertain?

> P7: Yeah.

Tyler: Do you wanna tell me about what's feeling uncertain right now?

> P7: I mean, well. Say, you know, as a veteran that like you never got a rating for hearing. You don't know if that's something that would be covered. Yeah, that might be what you know causes someone to be like, maybe I should just ask a general question because it's not covered, and maybe I need to request an exam in order to add that into my file or something, or if you already know that you're like service connected with, you know, a hearing issue, then you would click my own VA benefits.

Tyler: Yeah, that's a really helpful description for me. So you're trying to kind of think, okay, well, am I covered for this with my my disability benefits? And if not, you might choose a general question.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense to me. Well, let's choose my own benefits. And then we'll just stay on this page for a minute. But, how much longer do you think the form is going to be?

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:51.680

> P7: Well, it tells you right up top like number question you're on. So 2 more questions about your question.

Tyler: And if there's like 2 more questions left, what do you think they're gonna be if you had to guess?

> P7: Maybe like your benefits ID number. Some way of identifying. And maybe your location. I don't know.

Tyler: So some way to identify you, maybe by your benefits number and your location, okay, cool. So let's click continue, we'll see what happens on the next page.

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:30.079

> P7: Reason you're contacting us. Okay.

Tyler: Can you tell me what you would do on this page?

> P7: I have a question. That's why I clicked Ask VA, like, what is all this? What is all this? Oh, really, we could file a complaint about a service. I think that should be a separate, like, function on this website, you know. Ask VA, how about file a complaint?

Tyler: Okay, yeah. So immediately you're a little bit confused. Why, this is part of this. So, although you know what you would choose – I have a question – you're like, why is this? Why are these other options even here? And why do I have to answer this? Yeah, that's really helpful.

Tyler: So before we'll click on I have a question, because it sounds like that's what you would choose. And before we move on, how much longer do you think this form is going to be?

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.630

> P7: Oh, my God! I hope it... It didn't even move.

Tyler: Yeah. Why do you think that might be?

> P7: Oh, God, I don't know. I don't know.

Tyler: Yeah. So it sounded like you felt like it was going to be the number of questions right? And it doesn't look like that's meeting your expectations.

Tyler: Well, let's move on. Let's go ahead and click Continue.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:16.219

> P7: What's your question?

Tyler: Alright. So tell me about that reaction. How are you feeling now?

> P7: Okay. Now, we're finally getting somewhere.

Tyler: Yeah. So it felt like, this is kind of what you've been waiting for. Right?

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So we can't actually type in this prototype today. But can you just describe to me what you would do here. You could say I would click here, or I would type here.

> P7: I would type in how do I get seen for a hearing concern?

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:53.799

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, how much information do you feel like you need to give the VA at this point?

> P7: I mean, if they needed more than that, that should be a prompt before this question, yeah.

Tyler: That makes sense. Do you feel like this is kind of the last question?

> P7: It should be, yeah.

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:16.609

Tyler: I think that sounds really clear. So we'll pretend like you typed in just as you said. But we're gonna imagine that for today. And we're gonna just click on continue.

> P7: I mean, cause some Veterans have a beneficiaries, you know. So those benefits extend to their dependents.

Tyler: Yeah, why do you feel like the VA needs to know whether they're talking to a beneficiary or a Veteran?

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:02.060

> P7: Oh, it's different coverages. Yeah, I think it's because there's different coverages.

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So they need to know what you're covered with, because you're a Veteran or a family member. That feels clear to me. Is there anything else you notice on this page?

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:26.590

> P7: That it's required.

Tyler: Yeah. So up until this point have the questions been required? Or have there been any optional questions or not sure?

> P7: Not sure but it looks, you know, it's also saying, like, Hey, we're going to need some more personal information which I think should have been like up front. To begin with.

Tyler: You kind of feel like you've already given some personal information? Yeah I can definitely see that.

Tyler: Okay, let's click on to the next screen. So we'll click on continue.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:07.900

> P7: Okay. are you currently a VA employee? No.

Tyler: Okay, so pretty simple to answer the question. Why do you think the VA asks this?

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:25.730

> P7: I don't know. Yeah.

Tyler: That's a fair answer.

Tyler: Do you think this has an impact on the service you'll receive?

> P7: I'm curious. Because I'm actually interested in working for the department of the VA. But I wasn't aware there would be like any incentives, additional incentives, like, is that a thing? Now, this makes you wonder. But I don't know.

Tyler: Yeah, that's interesting. So a little unsure why this question is here. And maybe if there's any impact to how you answer it. Okay.

Tyler: That makes sense.

Tyler: Well, let's click continue. It looks like you've already answered no. And on this screen, we're not actually gonna type anything in like, I said. But let's look through these questions. And I wanna know if anything is standing out to you.

> P7: Just like, typically what I would expect to be required like your first and last name.

> P7: Okay, we're using socials. Okay. Pronouns. Okay. And gender identity. Okay.

Tyler: Yeah, so first, it was kind of meeting your expectations. We got first name, last name required. Then we see social security number or service number, date of birth is pretty typical.

Tyler: How about we go up to social security number real quick, without telling me your social security number. How would you answer this question?

> P7: I probably just put my last 4. Okay. Like, if I'm able to. But you know, it's just I thought we went away from that to DoD ID numbers now, because, you know, back in the day, we said, or social security numbers, you know, on our ID cards. Trying to protect PI. Now it's like, why do we go to the DoD ID number. Now, you know, we're just gonna still continue using socials.

Tyler: Yeah. So if you have to put your social security number in you definitely prefer to put in the last 4 digits. And maybe a little bit like surprise that you would have to even put your social security right.

Tyler: What's service number asking for?

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:12.899

> P7: I would assume the DoD ID number. That's what replaced our socials on our ID card. I would lean more towards the service number versus social. If it gives me that option.

Tyler: that makes sense. Well, we can move down a little bit. You mentioned date of Birth looked pretty standard for you.  And then we've got pronouns and gender. You reacted a little bit to seeing pronouns in gender in the form.

00:18:37.810 --> 00:18:42.640

> P7: Yeah, it's, I don't know.

Tyler: You can share your thoughts.

> P7: I just don't see how that's relevant.

Tyler: that makes sense. So in the context of what you're doing right now, which is asking the VA question about your hearing, it doesn't feel relevant what your pronouns are or what your gender is. Yeah.

Tyler: And if that's how you're feeling, which is totally understandable. Would you answer these questions?

> P7: I would, if there was an option prefer not to answer. That's what I would. But pronouns, is required, okay. Alright okay.

Tyler: Yeah, so it looks like they're required. And you would probably prefer to not answer them.


EDIT FROM HERE 
------

163
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:51.170
Tyler: So I just like, probably use my preferred name

164
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.950
Tyler: not to answer. Yeah.

165
00:19:55.330 --> 00:20:02.429
Tyler: alright. Well, that makes sense to me. So we'll pretend, like we filled this page in kind of how you were describing it to me. And then we're just gonna click, continue.

166
00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.780
> P7: And

167
00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:10.919
Tyler: alright. So can you describe this page to me.

168
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:17.849
> P7: Probably just typing in like the Va hospital that you go to

169
00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:23.240
> P7: for most of your care. Closest to your location.

170
00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.889
Tyler: Okay? Yeah.

171
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:37.529
> P7: And it looks like it says, search by name. Here it also says, search by location. What do those mean? Well, I mean, if you don't know the name. Maybe you've never gone to it. You just search by location and

172
00:20:37.530 --> 00:20:56.080
> P7: hopefully it'll tell you like, Hey, this is closest health facility based on your location. Do you know what your Va health facility would be? Yes, thank you.

173
00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:06.550
Tyler: The base. So okay, so that's good. So in your case. And you don't have to tell me your health facility, but it in your case. Which option would you choose? How would you search?

174
00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:12.220
Tyler: I would search by name because I know the name

175
00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:26.649
Tyler:  And when you search by name, are you searching like? Let's say, San Diego, va Medical Center? Or is there another thing? It's like the city Lakewood. Okay, cool.

176
00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:38.650
Tyler: Alright. So we we can't type in this today. But what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like we're typing. So we're gonna say that your health facility starts with James.

177
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:48.500
> P7: So if you click there perfect well, pretending like we typed in James. So now, what are we seeing?

178
00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:56.300
Tyler: And let's say that your help facility is called James J. Peters. Can you show me what you would do on this page?

179
00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:02.699
Tyler: Click this one right here. Okay? And if we clicked that one before we do that, what do you think is gonna happen next?

180
00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:15.170
> P7: That'll automatically put it into that bar. Okay? So it's gonna go up into that like search bar where it says, Yeah, that that makes sense. Let's click on it. And we'll see what happens?

181
00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.589
> P7: Okay, okay, so what are we seeing now?

182
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:32.609
> P7: Oh, it just listed all those health facilities. But it indicated which one that you actually clicked on on that one. And

183
00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:45.249
Tyler: let's say, at this point you realize, like, Oh, whoops! That's the health facility I used to go to, and it's not the one I go to anymore. What would you do in this moment? And we won't click. But you can just tell me

184
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:55.669
> P7: I'd go back to the search bar and probably erase James, if you know I had a brain fart and was like, Oh, yeah, that was my old health, facility and type. In the name of

185
00:22:55.970 --> 00:23:00.079
Tyler: where I do go to. Okay, yeah, that makes sense

186
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:05.239
Tyler: alright. Well, it looks like we've selected the right one. So we'll go ahead and click, continue

187
00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.149
> P7: alright. So yeah.

188
00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.890
Tyler: yeah, go ahead.

189
00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:22.600
> P7: No. Yeah. That's what I would expect for personal information, how to contact you to respond back to your question.

190
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:29.480
Tyler: Okay, so it makes sense that we're asking for your phone number in your email because we need to get back in touch

191
00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:35.670
> P7: and at this moment, how much longer do you feel like this form is going to be? Oh, my God, I hope it's

192
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:40.309
> P7: wrapping up soon. Yeah.

193
00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.529
Tyler: Do you feel like there's any other information the Via needs from you.

194
00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:54.749
> P7:  maybe an option here of like your preferred method of contact.

195
00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.890
> P7: Yeah.

196
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:58.130
Tyler: okay.

197
00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:05.359
Tyler: that makes sense. Let's let's pretend like we typed in your phone number and email address. And then we're gonna click, continue.

198
00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:16.889
> P7: Okay, alright, there it is. Yeah. So it looks like this. This met your expectation of what would come next.

199
00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:22.579
Tyler: Do without clicking anything? What would you normally choose for this question?

200
00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.810
> P7: Email, okay.

201
00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:39.969
Tyler: so you prefer to get be contacted by email. awesome. So for today, just in the interest of testing this website, we're actually gonna have you choose us mail, which I know is not what you would normally choose.

202
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:45.440
Tyler: But let's click continue, and we'll pretend like we chose us mail.

203
00:24:46.170 --> 00:24:47.010
> P7: Oh.

204
00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:51.470
Tyler: alright! So can you describe to me what we're seeing on this page.

205
00:24:51.780 --> 00:25:08.269
> P7: Looks like it's asking a series of questions in order to get your address, since that's an option you selected so because we chose us mail, and now needs to get my address. And

206
00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:09.770
Tyler: a

207
00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.870
Tyler: how would you answer this question?

208
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:25.279
> P7:  if I selected this option? I'm just okay. Select the country where you receive mail. United States

209
00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.339
Tyler: cool. Let's go ahead and try that.

210
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:33.809
> P7: Okay. that's most common. Yeah.

211
00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:39.639
> P7: like, that's the first option. Instead of scrolling all the way down to you?

212
00:25:39.770 --> 00:25:43.009
> P7: Yeah? And you said, you feel like that's, probably the most common

213
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:45.869
Tyler: okay, let's click continue

214
00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:50.519
Tyler: and now, what are we seeing on this page

215
00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:54.689
> P7: you writing in your mailing address?

216
00:25:54.820 --> 00:26:02.270
Tyler: Does anything here stand out to you? Maybe that's different to how you normally write your mailing address. No, this is pretty common. Okay.

217
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:08.249
Tyler: alright. Well, pretend, like we wrote in your your mailing address here, and then we're gonna click, continue.

218
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.979
Tyler: And now, what is this page asking for?

219
00:26:13.980 --> 00:26:28.179
> P7: It's looks like it's bouncing it with the Us. Postal service, and just confirming that it's a legitimate address and  and then a recommendation for

220
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.049
> P7: the suggested address.

221
00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:41.669
Tyler: yeah, have you seen something like this before? Okay, what do you usually choose in this situation? The suggestion or what you entered. Okay.

222
00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:52.050
Tyler: so it seems like it's pretty straightforward. You've seen this before, and it's already picked the option you usually choose. Okay, let's click, continue here.

223
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:59.389
Tyler: Alright, so we'll just look at this page for a minute without clicking anything.

224
00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.460
Tyler: What's the purpose of this page?

225
00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:12.680
> P7: Try to go over all these questions, making sure like, Oh, you know what? I changed my mind, and I need to

226
00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:17.540
> P7: change the option, and how I want to be contacted. Or

227
00:27:18.490 --> 00:27:23.150
> P7: yeah, just an opportunity to change any of your answers.

228
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:33.490
Tyler: Yeah, cool. So kind of before you you finish. This is like checking that things are correct or changing something if you want to. Yeah, cool.

229
00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:38.509
Tyler: Alright. So let's click on category and topic. And let's just review your category and topic.

230
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.820
> P7: So what are we seeing here?

231
00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:54.570
> P7: The category that we selected? And then the topic that best kind of falls with our question.

232
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:56.660
Tyler: can we change them?

233
00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.720
> P7: No.

234
00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:04.540
Tyler: do you think? Why do you think that is

235
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:22.939
> P7: cause it just doesn't give you the option? It says up there that it you may need to return to an earlier page in the form to edit some answers. So I guess you have to hit the back button, you know, 20 times change that category or topic.

236
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:30.490
Tyler: Right? Do you think that's something that you would even change at this point?

237
00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.630
Tyler: Yeah.

238
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:35.689
Tyler: okay, let's let's go ahead and click on your question.

239
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.040
okay.

240
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:47.940
Tyler: okay, so what are we seeing here? What you wrote in response to those questions? Right?

241
00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:53.450
> P7: So the responses that you gave and can you change these.

242
00:28:54.970 --> 00:29:00.060
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. Alright. Let's look at personal information.

243
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:09.300
Tyler: And you can, yeah, just describe to me what you're seeing here.

244
00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.810
> P7: All your personal information that you wrote in. And then the ability to like edit

245
00:29:14.910 --> 00:29:20.400
Tyler: okay, so this part you can change okay

246
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:33.849
> P7: so what if we wanted to change your phone number. Let's say you were reading this, and you realize you typed your phone number in wrong. Can you show me what we would do? I would click the edit button for contact information.

247
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:50.490
Tyler: and then we won't actually be able to edit the phone number. But I saw your mouse went straight to to where you would edit it. Right? Okay? So we would just go in there. And we'd we'd fix the phone number. And what other options can you edit in this little section

248
00:29:50.570 --> 00:30:05.879
Tyler: the medical facility information, your mailing address and your Id information. And if we look at that phone number section one more time. It looks like we've got phone number. And then we have email.

249
00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:09.659
Tyler: can we edit your contact preference?

250
00:30:09.770 --> 00:30:18.910
> P7: Can we edit? Say, you don't want to be contacted by us mail anymore. I guess, yeah, hit this update button. I hope.

251
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:24.200
Tyler: yeah. And

252
00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:31.719
> P7: you think that if we hit that update button we might be able to change the the Us. Mail preference. Okay.

253
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:34.110
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense.

254
00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:46.880
Tyler: Alright. Let's click cancel. We're just gonna kinda get out of this screen for perfect. Okay? So any last thoughts before we move on from this this screen?

255
00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.940
> P7: No.

256
00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:53.600
Tyler: yeah. Okay, great. So we'll go ahead and submit your question.

257
00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:59.079
Tyler: I'm going to give you a moment just to read this whole page.

258
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.600
> P7: Okay.

259
00:31:05.020 --> 00:31:08.439
Tyler: alright. So can you summarize to me what you learned from this page.

260
00:31:08.610 --> 00:31:11.059
> P7: So let you know that.

261
00:31:11.120 --> 00:31:26.740
> P7: Your question was submitted a like a reference number or tracking number was given to that question, and then they sent you an email based on the email that you typed in just confirming that and let you know when to anticipate, like

262
00:31:28.350 --> 00:31:32.589
> P7: like the reply coming back to you

263
00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:44.379
Tyler: cool. So we've got a reference number. We're also getting an email confirmation. And then our reply will be through the mail. When we get that reply through the mail. Are we also gonna get an email?

264
00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.060
> P7: Doesn't say that.

265
00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:58.090
Tyler: And at this point in the process, you've, you know, put in a bunch of information you've submitted your question, is there any other thing you need to know?

266
00:31:58.570 --> 00:31:59.340
> P7: Hmm.

267
00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:25.200
Tyler: okay, great. So it feels like pretty clear on what to expect next. Okay, so I know that we chose us mail for the purposes of today. But it usually you would choose email as your option. Right? So let's pretend like this said you should receive a reply via email within 7 business days.

268
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:37.040
Tyler: And let's imagine it's 7 business days later you've received this email. And the Va. Is describing to you how to get your hearing checked. Do you expect to be able to reply back to them?

269
00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:39.460
> P7: No.

270
00:32:40.190 --> 00:32:43.020
> P7: probably not. Yeah.

271
00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:44.139
Tyler: why is that?

272
00:32:44.490 --> 00:32:46.590
> P7: I don't.

273
00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:48.510
hmm.

274
00:32:53.080 --> 00:33:02.729
> P7: oh, no. I just feel that way. That's okay. So if maybe from past experiences of of doing something similar.

275
00:33:03.930 --> 00:33:14.410
> P7: usually you'd have to just kind of expect to go to the same nut nut role. And that didn't answer my question. I guess we gotta be a little more specific and go back on the website. And

276
00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.049
> P7:  you know, or

277
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:35.559
Tyler: see if there's a telephonic way of contacting someone at the Va with my question. Okay? So if you got a response back that didn't fully answer your question, you might submit a new one. That's maybe more specific. Or you might try and contact the via another way. Right? Yeah, that makes total sense to me.

278
00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:43.990
Tyler: I think that's all my questions for you on this prototype. So you're welcome to stop sharing your screen if you like. It's totally up to you, because I know

279
00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:48.139
Tyler: I won't see your face either way.

280
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:54.589
Tyler: okay, if you want to stop sharing, it's just at the top. Usually there's like a red button

281
00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:55.840
one.

282
00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.629
> P7: Oh, there it is. Okay.

283
00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:15.639
Tyler: perfect. Yeah, very, very small. Well, we have. We actually have about 20 min left. I don't think we'll use all 20 min, but we went through that really quickly. And I just want to spend a little bit of time reflecting with you on that process. How did you find it? Overall?

284
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.530
> P7: A a lot of the

285
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:24.330
> P7: information could probably be condensed into like less

286
00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:30.209
> P7: pages to go through.

287
00:34:30.659 --> 00:34:42.830
> P7: I think the personal information should be moved upfront before you know the final, the final like, okay, what's your question piece? Because it felt like, okay.

288
00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:52.440
> P7: I'm about to put my question in. We're done type thing. I think we should have the personal information upfront.

289
00:34:53.280 --> 00:35:08.749
Tyler: let's talk about that for a second. So it feels like we want to have the personal information upfront, and maybe a little bit more condensed. What do you think? Why do you think it is that you prefer to have your personal information upfront?

290
00:35:09.450 --> 00:35:12.519
> P7:  probably just the.

291
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.780
> P7: That's kind of how I think

292
00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:24.789
> P7: I've seen most of this go through like they're asking for that first before getting to the meat and potatoes

293
00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.110
Tyler: right? Okay.

294
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:32.370
Tyler: And here it kind of felt like we bounced around. Yeah, I can totally see that.

295
00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:48.860
Tyler: And when we talk about condensing the form a little bit, and maybe having less pages. Are we talking about having less pages to click through? Or are we talking about removing certain questions?

296
00:35:50.100 --> 00:36:01.320
> P7: Like, you know, there was the phone and email. And then the next page was like, then you were kinda given like, Oh, I have an option to be contacted through the Us. Mail like, why isn't that like

297
00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:05.479
> P7: put up in this block? So you already know, like, Okay.

298
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:13.649
> P7: that's an option, you know. Seem kind of it didn't flow.

299
00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:26.809
Tyler: Yeah, I can see that. So there's certain things that felt like they were similar that could be put on one page together. Yeah, that makes sense. And there was some questions where we kind of felt like

300
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:33.970
Tyler: surprise. They were there. So there was one question where it was asking the reason that we're that you're contacting us.

301
00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:58.790
> P7: and I remember you being a little bit surprised. That was where you chose. I have a question. Other people might say I have a compliment, and that felt like that didn't have have a place in this. Yeah, that would have came as a surprise to me that I even had the option to go through that. And then it just doesn't make sense that it would be under this Sva portion.

302
00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:09.210
> P7: Yeah, that doesn't make sense. Yeah, I totally hear you on that. Let's imagine a world where we had to ask that question like.

303
00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:16.189
Tyler: let's just say, that's that's how it is. So what? At what point in the process do you think that question should be?

304
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:20.559
> P7: Probably right at the beginning?

305
00:37:20.650 --> 00:37:26.989
> P7:  what's the purpose of you wanting to contact the va.

306
00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.290
Tyler: yeah.

307
00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:46.289
Tyler: So I'm kind of getting the sense from you. It feels like, you know. Ask me why I'm here. Ask for my personal information, and then let me tell you, like this is about my healthcare. This is about audiology. Let me ask you my question. That's kind of how you're seeing the flow. Right? Yeah, I can. I can totally see that that makes a lot of sense.

308
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:56.060
Tyler: If we think about like other experiences of contacting organizations, companies, customer service online.

309
00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:02.199
Tyler: And I'm sure you've probably had a similar kind of experience filling out an online form.

310
00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.940
Tyler: Can you think of a comparison? And maybe how this one

311
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:08.460
Tyler: measures up.

312
00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:17.320
> P7:  I think it's a little bit more like

313
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.340
> P7: there's a lot more questions for this one.

314
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:26.600
> P7: I don't recall it

315
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:36.319
> P7: being so robust just to submit a question. Yeah, a lot of those. I I'm

316
00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:41.909
> P7: familiar with like it being on like a one pager, you know, like.

317
00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:49.320
> P7: fill in your personal information. You know, what's your question and contact information, like all of that was.

318
00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:56.070
Tyler: I didn't have to click through 20 billion slides just to submit a question. Yeah.

319
00:38:56.110 --> 00:39:24.760
Tyler: more robust, maybe asking for more information and also clicking through a lot more screens than what you'd expect. Well, I've asked you a ton of questions. You've been really helpful and giving like concise, useful feedbacks. I really appreciate it. I wanna save a little bit of time in case you have any questions for me? There might be questions about what we're doing with this this prototype or anything else.

320
00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:29.160
> P7: No, I'm glad that y'all are kinda using

321
00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.440
> P7: this

322
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:37.310
> P7: platform to, you know. Test it before putting it out in the field and actually

323
00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:41.240
> P7: talking to service members and veterans about it cause?

324
00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:54.079
> P7: That's that's definitely appreciated. Yeah, well, we appreciate your feedback so much. You've noticed a lot of things that I've never noticed, and that other veterans haven't noticed. So

325
00:39:54.180 --> 00:40:06.140
Tyler: I really appreciate it. We we couldn't do what we do without help from from you and from other veterans. So yeah, thank you so much for your time.

326
00:40:06.270 --> 00:40:26.100
Tyler: Perigean. They're the folks who set up this research sess session. They're gonna send you a thank you note, and it's gonna have some information that you can pass on to other veterans or or folks like yourself, who will soon be veterans if they wanna participate in future research like this? And if you have any questions to follow up, you can ask them.

327
00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:34.750
Tyler: But I think that's it for me. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. You, too, Tyler.
