## Transcript - NEED TO CLEAN UP

Tyler: Alright. So are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

> P10: Yes.

Tyler: Thank you. Do you have any questions for me at this point?

Tyler: Okay, awesome. Well, we got through all the beginning bit. So I know that was a lot of information. But if anything comes up, just let me know.

Tyler: Before we jump into the prototype that I mentioned we're gonna look at together, I just like to learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the VA.

Tyler: How long have you been a veteran?

> P10: Oh, boy, since I got out of the service in 1,995. So I've been with the Va since about 1995, 96. Okay? And when you got out of service, did you start interacting with the Va. Right away, or only in the last

6
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.020
Tyler: couple of years

7
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.270
> P10: Took about maybe about 2 years to give or take to get fully activated with a

8
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:04.150
> P10: - 1: Umhm. Okay. Awesome at the time is a little bit difficult because they were so far out.

9
00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.930
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay.

10
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.609
Tyler: and now, are you like enrolled in healthcare. How are you interacting with the Va these days?

11
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.710
> P10: - 1: Mostly with healthcare.

12
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.099
Tyler: Have you ever contacted the Va

13
00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.080
> P10: - 1: Umhm?

14
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.359
Tyler: How do you usually contact them?

15
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.449
> P10: - 1: either

16
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.880
> P10: - 1: by email or by secure messaging through my health event.

17
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.410
Tyler: So you'll email them or you'll use secure messaging. That's really helpful.

18
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.330
Tyler: have you been using secure messaging for a while. Now.

19
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.019
> P10: - 1: about a year.

20
00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.429
Tyler: Yeah, is there anything you like about it?

21
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.249
> P10: - 1: Sometimes it's quick, sometimes it's slow.

22
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.790
Tyler: The biggest problem I have is actually getting into it.

23
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.410
> P10: - 1: Okay? So signing in

24
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:11.800
> P10: - 1: the old system that they had worked beautifully, and for some strange reason.

25
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.320
> P10: - 1: this new system that they got.

26
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:31.000
Tyler: It's hit or miss sometimes. Okay, so you're liking secure messaging. Sometimes it's quick to get a response, and sometimes it's a bit slower. Is that what you mean by slow. Okay? And then the sign in part is usually the biggest hurdle.

27
00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:52.170
Tyler: Yeah, that's helpful. So that's really interesting that you're using secure messaging. Because what we're gonna talk about today and the prototype I'm gonna show you is a little bit similar to secure messaging in that, you know, when you use secure messaging, you generally have a question, and you're seeking information from someone from the Va. And in the case of secure messaging, it's obviously your care team right?

28
00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:08.749
Tyler: And so what we're gonna be looking at today is a service called Askva. And this might be a little bit different to secure messaging. So throughout our conversation feel free to bring up comparisons, if that's helpful. And I might even ask you more questions about secure messaging.

29
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:09.960
> P10: - 1: Okay.

30
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:24.370
Tyler: alright. So let's go ahead and get started. We're gonna set ourselves up. With this prototype. So I'm gonna send you. It looks like you're in your computer, right? Not your phone. Okay, I'm gonna send you a link to the prototype in the Zoom chat.

31
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.769
Tyler: So you're going to get this really big link

32
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.730
Tyler: that starts with Www. Dot Bigma Yup.

33
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.559
Tyler: alright. So let's go ahead and open that on your computer.

34
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:45.990
> P10: - 1: Okay, you still here. Yep, I'm still here so I can see you, but you might not be able to see my me while you're looking at figma. Yeah. So do you have that open now on your computer?

35
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:55.359
> P10: - 1: It's opening up now. Okay, it's loading. So while that loads, why don't you come back to zoom so? Can you find your zoom window where you can see my face.

36
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.640
> P10: - 1: Okay.

37
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.279
Tyler: okay, so you can see me now. Alright, have you shared your screen on Zoom before?

38
00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.499
> P10: - 1: No.

39
00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:24.870
Tyler: we'll do that together. So when you're on the zoom window, where you can see my face. If you look at the very bottom it I'll have a bunch of little icons, and one of them in the middle is green. It says, share screen. You see that one. You can go ahead and click on that. And that's gonna ask you to choose your screen. So you're gonna have to look for that. Bigma Link

40
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.299
> P10: - 1: should have some blue

41
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.109
> P10: - 1: says, desktop one.

42
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.860
Tyler: Yeah, that sounds right. That's probably what it is.

43
00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.900
> P10: - 1: Okay.

44
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.480
Tyler: although that could actually be your desktop. We'll see.

45
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.570
> P10: - 1: I'll let you know

46
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.819
Tyler: when I can see something.

47
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.750
Alright.

48
00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.860
> P10: - 1:  just so, you know I'm on a

49
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.750
Tyler: so okay. so so far, I'm not seeing your screen.

50
00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.409
Tyler: But you could take your time.

51
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.580
> P10: - 1: And I have whiteboard.

52
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:12.640
> P10: - 1: Okay, ipad, the iphone ipad safari. That's where the Sigma was. Why don't we try safari? So if you click on safari and then you click share in the bottom right corner of your window. Okay?

53
00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:20.100
> P10: - 1: And that work.

54
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.289
Tyler: I'm not seeing it yet. So tell me what you're seeing.

55
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.559
> P10: - 1: No, okay, hold up.

56
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.009
> P10: - 1: Hold up.

57
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.580
> P10: - 1: I see what's going on.

58
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:40.439
> P10: - 1: Okay, I've never done this before. So no, that's okay. It's a lot of people's first time.

59
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.499
Tyler: So can you describe what you're seeing to me?

60
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.460
> P10: - 1: Alright. So what it wants me to do is allow

61
00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:13.010
Tyler: zoom to share or do things. Okay, I've had this happen before. So you're gonna have to give permission to zoom. Do you want to try and give this a go with me?

62
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.340
> P10: - 1: Sure.

63
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:25.449
Tyler: Okay, so you're gonna you're gonna have to leave Zoom, so we won't be able to talk while you do this, but when you close zoom, you can open your it should open your system preferences on your Mac.

64
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.439
> P10: - 1: and then you're gonna have the zoom

65
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.650
Tyler: app. It should open everything for you, and you're gonna have to allow screen share.

66
00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:47.069
Tyler: And this whole time you're not going to be on zoom. And then you're gonna have to come back to zoom. So you probably had a link in your email to get into this meeting right? Okay, cool. So you'll go ahead and just rejoin the meeting, and I'll and I'll be waiting here

67
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:54.090
> P10: - 1: if it doesn't work. After a couple of minutes, just rejoin the meeting, and we'll go from there. Okay, alright, I'll see you soon.

68
00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:04.839
e.a.: He has such a lovely smile, so much joy.

69
00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:18.919
e.a.: Sorry you didn't get to say, Hi, am I? I'm so sorry. I was on the phone call with my core and my other vap. And I was like, guys, I have to go to usability twisting session, no worries at all.

70
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:26.889
Tyler: If if he's not able to share his screen, I'll just share my screen. So we'll just give him a second. See how it goes.

71
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:27.950
Okay.

72
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:42.019
Thomas Michaud: I was surprised. This is the first participant that I've seen that that has faced this permission issue. Have you faced it before? Yeah, not this study, but usually there's always a couple people I see he's back. So I'm gonna let him in. Now, alright.

73
00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:53.100
Tyler: Hi, Jeb! Hi. alright! It looks like we're back. How did that go?

74
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:59.919
Tyler: Okay, cool. So if you want to go ahead, your cameras off now?

75
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:07.050
Tyler: so just like we set up at the beginning. Yeah, perfect. Now I can see you. And now let's go ahead and try and share screen.

76
00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:09.910
> P10: - 1: Okay.

77
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.330
alright.

78
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:19.100
> P10: - 1: alright. So I see it says, desktop one and safari launch meeting.

79
00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:34.219
Tyler: And I can't remember where that was. Yeah, that's okay. So what we can do is I'm just gonna send you the prototype again

80
00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.200
Tyler: and then let me know. Is that opening in safari

81
00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:40.870
and hold up!

82
00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:51.549
> P10: - 1: Hold up! Hold up, you! And I don't want to lose you. Yeah, I know the feeling well, I can still hear you and see you. So okay.

83
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.310
> P10: - 1: no.

84
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.860
Tyler: perfect.

85
00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.670
Tyler: It looks like I can see your screen now. So we're just gonna change tabs on safari.

86
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.709
Tyler: So you could even close. Do you know what I mean by change? Tabs?

87
00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:11.650
Tyler: Yeah. cool. So I'll give you a minute to

88
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.999
Tyler: yeah, that looks like the right one desktop.

89
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:18.309
Tyler: Yeah, let's click on desktop prototype. 2.

90
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.800
> P10: - 1: Okay.

91
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.660
Tyler: perfect, awesome.

92
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:29.699
Tyler: We did it. Okay. So now I can see your screen. So I'm seeing the same thing as you. And we're all set up.

93
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.799
Tyler: We're gonna just wait a minute before we click anything.

94
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:58.109
Tyler: so like, I mentioned this, this session is about getting your feedback. So we're gonna look through this website together. I'm gonna kinda guide you when we're ready to to click on things or sometimes I'm gonna ask you to show me where you would click okay, so on this page. I'm just gonna give you a minute to look around. We're not gonna click on anything, but you're welcome to scroll, and I'd love for you to tell me what you noticed first.

95
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:13.699
> P10: - 1:  let's see. Well, the biggest thing I noticed is that it's a Va. Department of veterans affairs. So I know it's correct. And then I see the blue sign in box.

96
00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.780
> P10: - 1: And that's where they told me to sign in.

97
00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:20.080
Tyler: Okay, and that's

98
00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:39.629
Tyler: okay. That's really helpful. So you know, you're on a Va website, and you see a blue sign in Box which is, where have you signed in before using that blue sign in box. Okay? So that looks familiar to you as well. Awesome. And if we're looking at this page that we're on now.

99
00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.930
Tyler: what is this page about

100
00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.960
Tyler: says, Ask Va.

101
00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:53.040
> P10: - 1: And it says, get answers to your questions about Va. Benefits and services and upload documents online.

102
00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:59.860
Tyler: You should receive his response in 7 days. Which is surprising. Okay.

103
00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:02.120
Tyler: and what's why? Is that surprising

104
00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.740
> P10: - 1: cause? Usually the Va is sometimes faster than that.

105
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.589
Tyler: Okay, so it feels a little bit long.

106
00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:12.340
Tyler: Umhm, that makes sense

107
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:23.689
Tyler: alright. And if if I told you so for the rest of our conversation, we're gonna pretend, like, you have to ask the Via question. Okay? So we're gonna say, you recently noticed some problems with your hearing.

108
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:36.149
Tyler: And you want to ask the Va. How to get your hearing checked. So you don't know how to get your hearing checked. You just know you probably need to see an audiologist. and so we've come onto here to ask the Va. What to do.

109
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:42.169
Tyler: So without clicking anything. Yet can you tell me what you would do first? Where would you click

110
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.090
> P10: - 1: and see?

111
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:51.139
> P10: - 1: I would probably sign in to my account.

112
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:58.219
Tyler: and then I would hit contact us under that.

113
00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.459
Tyler: That makes sense.

114
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:09.790
Tyler: So you first sign in up at the top, and that with that blue button and you click contact us. Okay, does it seem like you need to sign in in order to ask a question?

115
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:13.430
> P10: - 1: Usually.

116
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:20.689
> P10: - 1: when you deal with the Va. The way I was told and taught my Va. Is that

117
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:23.720
> P10: - 1: unless you sign into your account.

118
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:31.750
> P10: - 1: it's just general, and they don't tell you specifically for what's your problem.

119
00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:39.910
Tyler: So usually, when I sign in, I want to sign in directly for what my problems and concerns are

120
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:57.889
Tyler: that makes sense. That's really, that's really helpful. So your and your experience and from what the va told you signing in is gonna give you more specific information okay, that makes sense. If we scroll down a little bit on this page.

121
00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.599
Tyler: can you tell me what we're seeing here with this green button?

122
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.769
Tyler: Can you describe this to me.

123
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:11.660
> P10: - 1: Signing in is required. If you questions about education, benefits, work, study, or debt

124
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.699
> P10: - 1: need to sign in. If your questions is about education, pens, work, study, or debt.

125
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:24.800
> P10: - 1: Well, I guess they're talking about questions of education, benefits and work-study and debt

126
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.890
> P10: - 1: to sign in. If you have any questions about that.

127
00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:33.079
Tyler: Right? Okay, so if your question is about your hearing.

128
00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.800
Tyler: do you need to sign in

129
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:38.350
> P10: - 1: Umhm?

130
00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:43.360
> P10: - 1: Well.

131
00:13:45.990 --> 00:13:50.740
Tyler: let's see. Well, it's for benefits, I guess. Maybe.

132
00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:55.140
Tyler: Okay. So if it's for benefits, does that mean we need to sign in?

133
00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:03.329
> P10: - 1:  maybe not. Maybe not.

134
00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:09.530
Tyler: Okay. So I'm sensing. It's not super clear right? It's not. It's not an easy yes or no answer.

135
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.489
Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful.

136
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:23.979
Tyler: Let's let's scroll down a little bit further. I'm gonna move us along. So if we go down here, we're gonna see a link that says you can continue without signing in. Okay, do you see that link

137
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:29.290
Tyler: alright? So why do you think that link is there? What does that mean?

138
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:56.750
Tyler:  that's a good question. Continue without signing in. I don't think I would ever want to click that in the first place. Okay? And that's because you described to me that signing in will get you more specific information. Okay, that makes sense.

139
00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:10.780
Tyler: Well, I think that's really clear. It sounds like definitely the first thing you would do is sign in for today we're gonna do something a little bit different. We're gonna see what it's like if we didn't sign in. So we're gonna continue without signing in, you can go ahead and click on that.

140
00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.849
Tyler: Alright. Alright!

141
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:21.880
Tyler: Okay. So now, before we click anything else on this page, you can always feel free to scroll. However you like.

142
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:26.109
Tyler: I mentioned that we're asking the Va. How to get your hearing checked.

143
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.879
Tyler: With that in mind. Can you show me what you would do on this page?

144
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.370
Tyler: You can go ahead and click.

145
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.620
Right?

146
00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:38.290
> P10: - 1: Well, I would probably hit a category.

147
00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:42.599
Tyler: Yeah, okay.

148
00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:45.280
> P10: - 1: I would probably hit that.

149
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:48.919
Tyler: Okay. And let's see.

150
00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.370
Tyler: what are we seeing here?

151
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:58.260
> P10: - 1: A bunch of different

152
00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.040
Tyler: categories.

153
00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.989
> P10: - 1: and I would probably hit healthcare if it were for a hearing.

154
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.480
Tyler: Okay, let's choose healthcare. and then we'll just perfect

155
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.870
Tyler: awesome. We'll just stay on this page for a second a second before we continue.

156
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.779
Tyler: So that felt really quick for you to choose healthcare.

157
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.159
Tyler: How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

158
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:30.810
Tyler: Very important. How come?

159
00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:32.780
> P10: - 1: Because

160
00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.060
> P10: - 1: the one thing that I noticed with government websites, if you don't get to a particular spot right away.

161
00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:50.550
Tyler: Umhm.

162
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:57.519
Tyler: And at this point in the process, how long do you think this whole process is? Gonna take to ask the va, a question about your hearing.

163
00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.450
> P10: - 1: Hmm.

164
00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.589
> P10: - 1: don't know.

165
00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:09.259
Tyler: Yeah, I don't know, is always a good answer. So let's click continue.

166
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.390
Tyler: And now

167
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.699
Tyler: we're seeing this page. Can you show me what you would do on this page?

168
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:29.000
Tyler: Well, considering it would be my hearing, I would hit audiology and hearing aids.

169
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:42.319
Tyler: And then how is this question different from the last one? You answered More direct, it's more direct. Okay? Why do you think the Va is asking you this?

170
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:44.940
> P10: - 1: Well.

171
00:17:45.640 --> 00:18:00.960
> P10: - 1: it says, get answers and questions about via benefits and services and upload documents online. And we hit healthcare and audiology and hearing aids. So what I like about is it's right there.

172
00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:06.930
Tyler:  yeah, so i'm not searching for anything.

173
00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:09.740
Tyler: so you liked, how it narrowed it down, for you.

174
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:17.939
Tyler: yeah, that makes sense. what? What is this box here that says your category and topic? What is that?

175
00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:28.950
Tyler: Well, it's telling you that the category and topic is healthcare, so that you're at right now. Is that useful for you?

176
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.480
Tyler: Why is that useful?

177
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:40.150
Tyler: Because it's labeling what you're searching under? Okay, so it's showing you where this list of topics.

178
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.329
Tyler: 6. Okay, that makes sense.

179
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:47.669
Tyler: Alright. Let's go ahead and continue to the next page.

180
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:58.220
Tyler: Okay, so can you show me what you would do on this page.

181
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:03.089
> P10: - 1: Well, I continue to scroll down as your question.

182
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:12.330
> P10: - 1: and that says, what is your question about? And then what's a selection for? What your question is about. and

183
00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:17.649
> P10: - 1: you have I would look at is either my own Va. Benefits or a general question.

184
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:26.100
Tyler: since most of the time when I go to the Va. I'm asking about myself. I would probably hit my own Va. Benefits.

185
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:38.469
Tyler: That's really helpful to hear how you're thinking about it. So because it's probably about yourself. Specifically, you're going to choose my own benefits. And then a general question, what would that maybe be? For?

186
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:43.089
> P10: - 1: I think that would be just a general question about everything.

187
00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.890
Tyler: Go with us.

188
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:53.830
Tyler: Okay? So wouldn't be focused on you. It would be more general. Okay, that makes sense to me. So let's choose my own Va. Benefits like he says.

189
00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.690
Tyler: And at this point. how much longer do you think this form's going to be?

190
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:13.120
Tyler: Well, it says 2 of 4. So we're about halfway through. I don't think, yeah. Okay. So it feels like we're halfway through. And we just noticed it says 2 of 4 that that makes sense.

191
00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:17.939
Tyler: Alright. And what do you think that the Va neat still needs to know from you?

192
00:20:18.530 --> 00:20:24.460
> P10: - 1:  Well, probably who I am and where I'm located.

193
00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:31.030
Tyler: Okay, who you are and where you're located. That makes sense. So let's click, continue. And we're gonna see what happens next.

194
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:41.290
Tyler: And patents. why don't you go ahead and describe this page to me?

195
00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:55.860
> P10: - 1: Well, it's still under Sba. Get answers to questions about via benefits and services, load up documents and online. And they want to know what the question, the reason for contacting us.

196
00:20:56.140 --> 00:21:06.849
Tyler: And they want to know what your question is. Okay? So they want to know the reason you're contacting us. And what your question is. Okay, that makes sense.

197
00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.509
Tyler: So let's look through these options.

198
00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:13.569
Tyler: And then which one do you think you would choose.

199
00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:22.630
Tyler: Oh, it would probably be. I have a question, the first option. Okay, let's click. I have a question.

200
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:27.510
Tyler: Why do you think the Va. Is asking you this

201
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.269
Tyler: because you're contacting them.

202
00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.140
> P10: - 1: And you have a question.

203
00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:35.650
Tyler: Okay?

204
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:44.940
Tyler: So you think that the Va wants to confirm that you have a question. okay. And what about these other options in the list?

205
00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:49.399
Tyler: Can you imagine choosing one of these other options? Maybe in a different scenario?

206
00:21:49.810 --> 00:21:55.179
> P10: - 1: No, if you want to say something nice. You have a complaint. or have a suggestion.

207
00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:00.949
> P10: - 1:  attending the town hall. Now, I have a question, I don't

208
00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:05.629
> P10: - 1: never intended a town hall. So I have nothing of the anything about that.

209
00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.150
> P10: - 1: Or you want to say, something else.

210
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.150
Tyler: okay.

211
00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:15.330
> P10: - 1: I think, just how the

212
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:23.790
> P10: - 1: I think it's just a little bit too much. You know what I mean. Yeah, tell me more about that. Why is it a little bit too much? Because

213
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:27.759
> P10: - 1: if you're just contacting them with a question.

214
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:34.630
> P10: - 1: you're just throwing in a couple little things in there that doesn't have anything to do with what it's asking.

215
00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:43.599
> P10: - 1: Right? Okay, it could get a little confusing. Okay, cause you came here to ask them a question. Now, there's these other things here.

216
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.440
Tyler: Yeah, I can totally see that. Okay, let's click continue.

217
00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:52.530
Tyler: Okay.

218
00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:58.839
> P10: - 1: and this is nice. So now, you can put actually your question in.

219
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.949
Tyler: okay, so this is nice. Why? Why is this nice.

220
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:09.219
Tyler: because it allows you to say in your words what you're here for.

221
00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:16.469
Tyler: So this is kind of a point in the process that you were maybe expecting. And you're happy to see it.

222
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:22.109
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And so we can't actually type in this prototype.

223
00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:36.269
Tyler: But it felt clear to you that. Here's where you would go. And you type in your question. Right? Okay? And at this point, let's say, we type in your question. Before we hit continue. What else do you think the Va. Is going to ask you?

224
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:51.640
> P10: - 1: Well, they're still gonna ask me who I am and where I'm located, cause they don't know those 2 things yet, right?

225
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:58.779
Tyler: And how much longer do you think the form's gonna be? Well, we're still about half way.

226
00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:07.539
> P10: - 1: We're in the second line here in the slip blue. So we're still haven't entered 3 or 4 yet.

227
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.659
> P10: - 1: but what I like

228
00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:13.999
> P10: - 1: is, it has a 800 number down here. So if you get stuck.

229
00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.970
Tyler: you can call somebody.

230
00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:31.859
Tyler: That's a great observation. So you just noticed there's the 800 number. And and that way you wouldn't be kind of lost if you if you needed help. Awesome. Okay? Well, we'll pretend like we typed in your question. We'll click. Continue.

231
00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:37.439
> P10: - 1: Okay. We moved over one.

232
00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:47.009
Tyler: We moved over one. And are you talking about the the bar? Okay? So we noticed that pretty quickly. And what else are we noticing on this page.

233
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:51.080
> P10: - 1:  This is what I would expect.

234
00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:57.969
Tyler: Are you a family member? Are you the veteran himself? I would be hitting the under veteran.

235
00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:02.780
Tyler: Right? Okay, so you're the veteran you can go ahead and select. I'm the veteran.

236
00:25:02.890 --> 00:25:05.859
Tyler: And and why is the Va asking this?

237
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:07.030
> P10: - 1: Huh?

238
00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:17.209
> P10: - 1: It says it's going to ask some personal information, and we use this information to help us understand your question, to find the answers you need.

239
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:31.449
Tyler: Now, they're starting to realize. Okay, well, who are you? And where are you?

240
00:25:36.330 --> 00:25:37.410
> P10: - 1: Okay?

241
00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.590
> P10: - 1: This is one thing I could never understand why they always included this in here.

242
00:25:43.820 --> 00:26:04.750
> P10: - 1: Yeah, does this is this feel familiar? This question it feels familiar, but I understand that some Va veterans are va employees. I think the majority, though of this part II would expect this to be on more of a portal for Va. Employees, not for portal for veterans.

243
00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:12.589
Tyler: Right? Okay. So you think the majority of veterans are not employees. So why are they asking this? Yeah.

244
00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.390
Tyler: why? Why do you think that they are asking this?

245
00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.850
> P10: - 1: Because

246
00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:24.039
Tyler: maybe they need to find out if you work for them or not?

247
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:30.379
Tyler: What impact do you think that'll have if you choose? Yes or no?

248
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:38.380
> P10: - 1: It's just that, I think with some people when they look at this they get confused.

249
00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:55.219
Tyler: And when I look at this, the first question in my mind is, why is this here on a veterans website, it should be on a Va employees website. Umhm. So it feels very out of place. Yes, yeah, that's really helpful. That makes sense to me.

250
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:59.719
Tyler: Well, what would you do if you had to answer this page? Can you show me?

251
00:26:59.810 --> 00:27:03.700
Tyler: Haven't hit? No, okay, let's go ahead and click click now.

252
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:06.710
Tyler: and we'll click. Continue.

253
00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:20.979
Tyler: Okay. So describe to me what we're seeing here. I want my personal information.

254
00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:22.040
Tyler: And

255
00:27:22.230 --> 00:27:28.970
Tyler: we're not gonna actually type anything in like, I said. But let's look through these questions, and I'd like to know if anything stands out to you.

256
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.390
> P10: - 1: Okay.

257
00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:44.860
> P10: - 1: they want required sections of first and last name, which is good. the suffix which I think is Mister Miss, or misses.

258
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.739
> P10: - 1: they'd like a preferred name. We're not really

259
00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.460
Tyler: required. They want your social security number

260
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.399
> P10: - 1: and service number.

261
00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.060
> P10: - 1: the service number I I've always wondered about because

262
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.049
> P10: - 1: and I'm 55,

263
00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:13.289
Tyler: and I know when I was in the Navy I was the last group of people that got a service number back in 1986, and they haven't used service numbers since 86.

264
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:20.030
So I think the vast majority of people don't even know what the service number is anymore.

265
00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:26.040
Tyler: Right? Yeah, no, that's a really good point. What would happen if you don't know your service number. What would you do on this page

266
00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:33.910
Tyler: have put in my Normal Social security number? Yeah.

267
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:56.079
> P10: - 1: I mean service numbers. Most veterans don't remember them or know them. I mean, up until 1,997. I used to know it, but after that I never used it anymore.

268
00:28:56.150 --> 00:29:17.070
Tyler: because you don't even know your service number at this point. Yeah, I think you're probably right there, do you? Do you have any hesitation about putting your social security number in, why do you think the Va needs that?

269
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.190
> P10: - 1: Because they need to specifically know who you are?

270
00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:31.189
Tyler: Okay? So they're trying to identify you. That makes sense. Okay, let's keep looking at these these fields and keep telling me how you're seeing them.

271
00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:35.020
> P10: - 1: Okay, date of birth. That's obvious.

272
00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:49.379
> P10: - 1: They always want to know what year you were born. Pronouns I used to go to. I used to work for the city of Pittsfield, and they started this section. So III know pretty much about

273
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:57.590
> P10: - 1: pronouns. So I know that's part of diversity and all that stuff. So it's good to see it, but

274
00:29:57.770 --> 00:29:59.100
> P10: - 1: and also

275
00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:07.579
> P10: - 1:  on a personal level. It's not really necessary, but it's good to see it.

276
00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:18.569
Tyler: gotcha, that's helpful. So you said on a diversity level. It's good to see this on a personal level. It's not necessary. Yeah, that's helpful. Okay?

277
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:20.960
Tyler: And then anything else we're seeing here

278
00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:26.379
> P10: - 1: again with gender identity. It's good to see it on the diversity level.

279
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:39.400
Tyler: but personal level, not necessary. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So you don't need to tell me how you would answer these questions, but would you choose to answer them, or would you choose like? Prefer not to answer?

280
00:30:39.890 --> 00:30:49.500
> P10: - 1:  I would probably answer it. But then again, maybe prefer not to either.

281
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:58.250
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense, especially cause you said, it's not necessary for you that this is here.

282
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.720
Tyler: But also, you recognize why it might be here.

283
00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:09.070
Tyler: Okay, well, let's go ahead and continue, we're gonna go onto the next page. We're gonna pretend, like we put in all your information.

284
00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:24.049
> P10: - 1: Okay? Still, under personal information. Okay. So we just noticed the progress still says personal information. And why don't you describe this page to me, what are we seeing now?

285
00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:32.039
> P10: - 1: It says, your Va. Health facility. and it says, search by name or search by location.

286
00:31:32.610 --> 00:31:37.289
> P10: - 1: So that's a good thing, because now, they want to know where you are

287
00:31:37.390 --> 00:31:42.269
Tyler: right? And that's something you'd been waiting for them to ask you.

288
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:44.580
Tyler: why do you think they need to know where you are.

289
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:55.910
Tyler: because I don't think they won't be the S. To send me to a Va. Up in Alaska, right? So they want to be able to send you to the right? Va,

290
00:31:55.950 --> 00:32:05.070
Tyler: that makes sense and you mentioned it says, search by name and it says, search by location, what's the difference between those. Can you describe them to me?

291
00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.350
> P10: - 1: Well, every Va facility has some sort of name.

292
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:12.700
Tyler:  

293
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:22.419
> P10: - 1: Right now, at the top of my head. I can't remember what the name of my Va. Facility is, so it would be better to search by location.

294
00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:34.360
Tyler: And so when you say they have a name. Let's pretend like I've never heard of Va. Medical centers before. Are you saying the name is like the Los Angeles Va. Or it's a different type of name that's hard to remember.

295
00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:46.029
> P10: - 1: Well, I know that the Va. Down the leads Massachusetts, which is the one I go to. They just named it after a veteran himself, and

296
00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.880
Tyler: I just can't remember. So yeah.

297
00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:58.679
> P10: - 1: I've always referred to it since I come up here from Pennsylvania. I've always referred to it as leads. Va.

298
00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.550
> P10: - 1: that's how most people remember.

299
00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:11.730
> P10: - 1: But I'm trying to think of wha what's that name? Something like Boland? I think they need it after. So

300
00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:36.580
Tyler: might be harder to remember. That's really useful. So usually you would search by location. And would you type in like your city? How would you search by location. What would you expect to do?

301
00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:39.960
> P10: - 1: I would search in by city and state.

302
00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.060
Tyler: city and state. Okay.

303
00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:53.090
Tyler: okay, great. So for today, we're gonna switch things up, because I know this is not normally how you would search. Well, now, I know but we're gonna pretend like we are searching by name.

304
00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:56.669
Tyler: And we can't type today. So we're gonna pretend like we're typing.

305
00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:04.989
Tyler: And we're gonna say that you started typing in James. You knew that was the beginning of the facility. So if you click on that box where you'd usually type

306
00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:06.760
> P10: - 1: right here, search

307
00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:12.229
Tyler: we're actually gonna click just to the left of that? Yeah, perfect. We'll click there.

308
00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:28.879
Tyler: Okay, there's James, yeah. Okay, so you're gonna have to use some imagination. We just typed in James. And now what are we s seeing seeing? Okay? And then I saw your mouse went all the way over to search. Is that what you click next? You think?

309
00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:43.149
Tyler: Yeah, well, it's you scroll down here. You can scroll down or you can click, search. Okay? So for the purposes of today, let's say your medical center is called James J. Peters.

310
00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.160
Tyler: Do you show me what you do next? Right here?

311
00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:52.259
Tyler: I mean, hit that. Okay. And now what are we seeing?

312
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.959
James J. Peters is lit up.

313
00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.020
Tyler: Okay.

314
00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:00.799
Tyler: Gotcha. So that means maybe you've chosen that one.

315
00:35:00.810 --> 00:35:12.549
Tyler: We don't need to click anything else now. But what if you realize you've chosen the wrong one. So let's say you were like, wait, I don't live in New York anymore. That's my old facility. What would you do at this point.

316
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:14.870
Boy.

317
00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:21.559
Tyler: I would probably hit the back button hopefully, that would correct the problem. Okay.

318
00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:34.459
Tyler: which back button? Can you tell me where on your screen, the one down here. Okay, so you'd probably hit the back button and hopefully that would correct the problem, you said, yeah, okay.

319
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:40.600
Tyler: so we'll we'll keep this one. We'll say your health facility is James J. Peters, and then we'll just click. Continue.

320
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:41.560
Okay.

321
00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:53.780
Tyler: oops, that's little like that. Okay, so at this point in the process, before we look at this page too closely.

322
00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.120
Tyler: How much longer do you think the form is going to be?

323
00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:06.740
> P10: - 1: Well, for a little over half, so hopefully it'll be over soon. Quarter. So

324
00:36:06.810 --> 00:36:08.350
Tyler: we're at 3 quarters.

325
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:13.559
Tyler: Yeah. What other information do you think the Va needs from you.

326
00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:19.160
> P10: - 1: Well, they want an email and a phone number. So an email.

327
00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:26.050
Tyler: So that's obvious. Yeah. is there anything else you think we might see before the end of the form.

328
00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:33.200
> P10: - 1: And let's see. So they have my name. They have my social security.

329
00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:42.410
> P10: - 1:  Did they get my address? I can't remember.

330
00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:50.639
Tyler: I'm not gonna answer your question yet. But do you think they need your address? Probably. Why do you think they need your address?

331
00:36:50.880 --> 00:37:07.749
Tyler: Well, so they can continue to give me more selections of what's around my area. Right? Okay? So they want you want it to make sure it's like location specific. For you. Yeah, that makes sense.

332
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:22.890
Tyler: If we compare this form to a maybe another form you've filled out in the past. To contact a company or a bank or an organization. This feel the same amount of pages, or the same length, or or longer, or shorter

333
00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:30.460
> P10: - 1:  and I think,

334
00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:58.290
Tyler: well, I know right now it feels like it's a little longer, cause we're going piece by piece. Yeah, I think it would feel about the same. Okay, yeah. So you're recognizing obviously, us having a conversation while you do this is making it feel longer. But maybe in in a different setting, it would feel the same. Yep, okay, that makes sense. And now we're looking at this page. It says, your phone number and email.

335
00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:06.329
Tyler: we can't fill these in with this prototype. But do you have any hesitation about what you'd what you're supposed to do on this page?

336
00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:14.130
> P10: - 1: Well, the one thing I've noticed in past va  forms that I filled out

337
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:20.809
> P10: - 1: if I don't fill it out specifically the way they want it, it locks up.

338
00:38:20.830 --> 00:38:26.360
Tyler: And the one thing I have is that they always put

339
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:40.140
> P10: - 1: parentheses Xxx. Xx. Dash XXXX, XX. And I go right away and fill in my phone number. And the first thing that pops up is, it's not correct

340
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.510
Tyler:  so that's the one thing.

341
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:47.630
> P10: - 1: they need to spell it

342
00:38:48.110 --> 00:39:01.780
Tyler: out, how they want it filled out, yeah, that's really helpful. So in in other Va forms that you filled out, you remember that sometimes when you type in your phone number, it doesn't accept the the format.

343
00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:13.250
> P10: - 1: cause. I put in [# # #], dash [# # # # # #] (redacted), and that's it. No more dashes, and it links in right away. Not acceptable form.

344
00:39:13.290 --> 00:39:28.119
Tyler: Right? Okay? So you wish it would tell you. If if it's gonna not accept different phone formats, it needs to tell you the format? Yeah. So you notice here that it doesn't tell you the format and and you automatically are like, well, now, I might type it in wrong.

345
00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.270
Tyler: Yeah, that's really helpful.

346
00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:35.499
Tyler: And and why is it asking for your phone number? And email?

347
00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:47.240
Tyler: Okay, yeah. So they want to get a hold of you. So that feels clear that you would give both your phone number and your email. Okay, let's let's go ahead and click. Continue

348
00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:53.770
> P10: - 1: alright. Still. 3 quarter.

349
00:39:53.900 --> 00:40:01.419
Tyler: Yeah. Still 3 quarters. And now what are we seeing here? Your contact? Preference?

350
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:12.559
Tyler: Because they want to know how to contact you.

351
00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:13.870
> P10: - 1: And

352
00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:24.000
Tyler: the one thing I've also noticed in typical government is they only allow you to pick one.

353
00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:37.170
Tyler: And to me, either by phone or email, is acceptable. And so I hope that there's more than one you could pick. Right? Okay? And before we click here, does it look like you can choose one or more than one?

354
00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:47.119
Tyler: It looks like you can only pick one. Okay, what makes you think you can only pick one because it says, How should we contact you? Your contact preference.

355
00:40:47.130 --> 00:41:01.820
Tyler: and then only says required. And it only looks like one. Okay, so you would, you ideally would choose phone and email. But it looks like this is gonna only let you choose one option.

356
00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.299
Tyler: Right? Okay, that's really helpful feedback.

357
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:08.430
Tyler: So you can, in fact, only choose one on this form.

358
00:41:08.450 --> 00:41:11.579
Tyler: If you had to choose, would you choose phone or email?

359
00:41:12.430 --> 00:41:17.200
> P10: - 1: Probably. Well, it's Va, probably email.

360
00:41:17.370 --> 00:41:22.870
Tyler: okay? Yeah, why? Why do you say it's Va, probably email?

361
00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:24.600
> P10: - 1: Because

362
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:33.359
> P10: - 1: on my phone, my iphone, I usually, if the you're not in the contacts, you're automatically going to voicemail and blocked.

363
00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:37.520
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So you wanna make sure that you

364
00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:49.530
Tyler: you would receive the right, the phone number phone call. And you wouldn't if their phone number is not saved. Okay, that makes sense. So emails a safer option because you don't know the phone number that's going to be calling you

365
00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:53.749
Tyler: And are you expecting to get an email? Who are you expecting to get an email from

366
00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:58.600
usually they send it va.gov, or

367
00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:11.839
Tyler: somebody that va.gov or whatever. But usually I know it's from the Va or the Va, and you'll get that email from them. Okay, that's really helpful. So

368
00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:17.300
Tyler: I know you'd usually choose email or even phone. And email. But for today.

369
00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:28.719
Tyler: we're going to do something a little different. We're going to pretend like you'd prefer us mail. This is really just so we can test this website. So let's click on us mail. and then we'll just click, continue alright

370
00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:33.969
Tyler: alright, and then let me know what you're seeing here.

371
00:42:35.310 --> 00:42:36.360
Okay.

372
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:41.399
> P10: - 1: still 3 quarter. Could you hear you receive bail?

373
00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.850
> P10: - 1: That's okay.

374
00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:47.840
Tyler: Tell me. Tell me why you're laughing here.

375
00:42:48.740 --> 00:43:00.450
> P10: - 1: because I'm in the United States. I'm in conus, and I don't reside outside the United States or on a military base. So

376
00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:02.709
> P10: - 1: I would think that

377
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:16.090
Tyler: if they would say us mail they would know that it's already coming from the United States. Right? Okay. So on the last screen, you said Us mail. And now you're like, obviously, I'm in the United States

378
00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:27.379
Tyler: right? They shouldn't be asking this. And are they asking for for your country or the country where the mail is coming from?

379
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:36.619
> P10: - 1: So that's why I find it a little bit off till why are they asking this?

380
00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.559
> P10: - 1: Umhm checked it.

381
00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:47.980
Tyler: Right? It felt repa repetitive. Yeah, that's really helpful. What does this mean? Where it says, I received mail outside of the Us.

382
00:43:48.530 --> 00:43:50.509
> P10: - 1: So this well.

383
00:43:52.070 --> 00:43:53.230
> P10: - 1: I would think.

384
00:43:55.380 --> 00:44:04.069
> P10: - 1: Well, the only thing I know is that there's a lot of veterans in Costa Rica that I found on over the years. So what they're talking about?

385
00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:18.150
Tyler: Yeah, okay, so not totally sure. But you think it might be like veterans. You live in Costa Rica as an example. Okay, cool. Well, let's let's choose United States. You can show me how you'd choose United States here.

386
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:20.020
> P10: - 1: We'll go down here.

387
00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:30.190
Tyler: At least they gathered at the top and not all the way down under you. Yeah, okay, so even though it kind of felt like it should be

388
00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:51.540
Tyler: obvious, or you don't even need to ask this question. At least it was pretty quick to find United States. Right? Yeah, right? Yeah, that makes sense. That's good feedback.

389
00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:53.160
Tyler: Let's click continue.

390
00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:57.320
> P10: - 1: Okay.

391
00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:59.110
> P10: - 1: so what's that quarter?

392
00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:06.010
Tyler: Yeah. So we're still at 3 quarters. Is that is that kind of what you expect at this point.

393
00:45:06.500 --> 00:45:13.290
Tyler: Hmm! That'd be kind of the that we're getting finished

394
00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:26.019
Tyler: kind of feeling like it's ready to be to be done? And this is asking for your mailing address. Does this look standard? Does this look different to how you usually put your mailing address in

395
00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:38.419
Tyler: looks pretty standard looks pretty standard.

396
00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:42.080
> P10: - 1: Okay?

397
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:46.939
> P10: - 1: It says we can't confirm your address.

398
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:52.499
Tyler: Yeah. So what's it asking for you to do? Confirm your address?

399
00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:57.840
> P10: - 1: And then it would ask you which the one you entered in the suggested address.

400
00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:13.520
Tyler: So this is something that I found similar on us postal website. So it makes sense. Okay, so this is familiar from looking at the Usps website, it makes sense. Would you usually choose what you entered or the suggestion?

401
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:21.900
Tyler: Okay, well, it looks like that's already chosen for you. So we'll click. Continue.

402
00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:28.310
> P10: - 1: Okay.

403
00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:35.620
Tyler: right? So now, what are we seeing? Editing answers?

404
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:46.210
> P10: - 1: And you are only able to edit some answers on this page, you may need to return it to an earlier page in the form. They added some answers. okay.

405
00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:50.140
Tyler: okay. so what's the purpose of this page.

406
00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:57.829
> P10: - 1:  I think it would be to verify what you're putting in.

407
00:46:59.430 --> 00:47:02.439
Tyler: Umhm. Okay, that makes sense.

408
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:05.000
Tyler: Let's look at your category and topic.

409
00:47:06.770 --> 00:47:07.730
> P10: - 1: Okay.

410
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:13.779
Tyler: alright. So what are we seeing here?

411
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:17.730
> P10: - 1: Healthcare and audiology? That's good.

412
00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:26.770
Tyler: They got that right. They got that right. Okay, so that's that's what you're expecting to see. Okay.

413
00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:28.390
Tyler: can you change this?

414
00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:38.590
Tyler:  I don't see anywhere to change it.

415
00:47:39.090 --> 00:47:45.269
Tyler: So why? Why are they showing you this to make sure what you're asking. Okay.

416
00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:50.039
Tyler: let's choose. Let's look at your question.

417
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:51.370
Yeah.

418
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:54.110
> P10: - 1: Oops.

419
00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:58.910
Tyler: yeah. Sorry. That's just the prototype. There you go

420
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:04.550
Tyler: alright. And what are we seeing here?

421
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.240
> P10: - 1: Okay, my own

422
00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:17.020
> P10: - 1: Va benefits. I have a question. And I want to have my hearing checked and possibly receive hearing aids, how do I go about this

423
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:22.510
Tyler:  they have another function in here.

424
00:48:23.090 --> 00:48:23.969
Tyler: So if

425
00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:31.269
> P10: - 1: maybe I need to verify something out of here hopefully, that would be what I would be able to edit.

426
00:48:31.490 --> 00:48:40.329
Tyler: Okay, so hopefully, you'll be able to edit your question. Right? Okay. let's click on personal information. Let's look at that one.

427
00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.370
Okay.

428
00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:49.580
Tyler: so just describe to me what we're looking at here.

429
00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:54.990
> P10: - 1: You would be a employee. No. a name

430
00:48:56.080 --> 00:49:00.720
> P10: - 1: preferred. Name, social security number 1997,

431
00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:04.490
> P10: - 1: and write in an email.

432
00:49:04.570 --> 00:49:06.450
Tyler: Umhm. Okay.

433
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:13.209
> P10: - 1: medical facility information to edit that's good contact, able to edit.

434
00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:17.289
> P10: - 1: That's good mailing address, able to edit. Yep.

435
00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:18.780
> P10: - 1: okay.

436
00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:28.520
Tyler: So you're saying, as you go through this, you're saying able to edit that that's good. So you appreciate the ability to edit this information.

437
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:36.219
Tyler: Why is that? Because you never know I've been something wrong.

438
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:44.879
Tyler: So it's helpful that while you're reviewing this, you can change something if you need to. Let's pretend like you noticed your phone number was entered incorrectly.

439
00:49:45.130 --> 00:49:47.169
Tyler: Can you show me what you would do here?

440
00:49:47.770 --> 00:49:49.250
> P10: - 1: The

441
00:49:50.570 --> 00:49:51.670
> P10: - 1: let's see.

442
00:49:52.020 --> 00:50:02.800
Tyler: I probably hit this. and hopefully will be allowing me to come in here and change this specifically, why don't we click edit.

443
00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:11.679
Tyler: so we won't be able to type. But does. This is this kind of what you were thinking? You'd see. It sounds

444
00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:14.930
Tyler: similar to what you described. Yeah, okay?

445
00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:21.410
Tyler: And it also looks like we could edit our email here. Can we edit our our contact preference

446
00:50:24.210 --> 00:50:26.609
> P10: - 1: and see?

447
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:34.239
Tyler: No.

448
00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:43.930
Tyler: okay, so we can. I see where your mouse is. So we found where the contact preferences. But it doesn't look like we can edit it right? Why do you think that is?

449
00:50:45.450 --> 00:50:49.659
Because we made it that way in the old part or the other section?

450
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.920
Tyler: Hmm, okay.

451
00:50:52.100 --> 00:50:58.680
Tyler: So we we chose us mail before, and so we can't change it now. Okay.

452
00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:05.859
Tyler: alright. Well, we'll click cancel. We'll just pretend like we didn't actually need to change anything. Yeah, that's perfect.

453
00:51:07.090 --> 00:51:13.289
Tyler: And then we're just gonna submit your question. We're gonna say, we're all done. We're ready to send this to the Va.

454
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:18.990
Tyler: Right now. I'll give you a minute to read this page.

455
00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:29.560
Tyler: Okay, it's letting me know that the question was submitted successfully.

456
00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:34.159
> P10: - 1: and thanks me. So many of the questions of Us. Department of energy spares

457
00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:38.299
> P10: - 1: gives me a reference number.

458
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:48.220
> P10: - 1: which is what I would expect or from other websites. So that's a good thing. I've never seen that before. That's a good thing.

459
00:51:48.730 --> 00:51:58.059
Tyler: So that way, if the Va. Calls me or I call the Va. I can say I have a reference number for this problem. That's a good thing to have

460
00:51:58.530 --> 00:52:07.610
Tyler: right? Okay? So the reference number is particularly helpful. Cause you can make sure you're talking about the same thing as the person on the phone. Yeah, okay?

461
00:52:07.860 --> 00:52:15.019
> P10: - 1: And the one thing I'm not seeing on here, which would also be a good thing

462
00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.640
> P10: - 1: usually on other websites and other.

463
00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:28.660
> P10: - 1: especially on, say, like the US. Postal service or other government websites. It has a little section that says, you can print this page.

464
00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.110
Tyler: Okay.

465
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:43.709
> P10: - 1: what I would love to do is print that reference number saved. And so you wish that it said, print this page? Right? Yeah.

466
00:52:44.050 --> 00:52:46.859
> P10: - 1: it's beautiful.

467
00:52:47.470 --> 00:52:57.419
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense and if not, if you if you didn't, if you couldn't print this page, how would you know that you? How would you save your reference? Number.

468
00:52:58.570 --> 00:53:07.820
> P10: - 1: Well, it's Mac, so I would print the page. Anyway.

469
00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:14.430
> P10: - 1: I would have to write this reference number down on a piece of paper if I didn't have this capability.

470
00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:18.739
Tyler: and if I lose the paper I'm out of luck.

471
00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:21.750
Tyler: right? Okay? So you would. Probably

472
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:44.659
Tyler: I would print it and put it into the folder. So I know, right? Okay, so you sound very organized. I. I'm also very organized. So I understand you wanting to to print this out and make sure you definitely have your reference number and at this point in the process, what happens next?

473
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:48.000
> P10: - 1: Let's see.

474
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:58.980
> P10: - 1: I would be expecting an email confirmation. And it's nice that they're letting me know that I will receive a reply within 7 business days.

475
00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:03.800
Tyler: which usually the Da. Takes about a week give or take

476
00:54:04.260 --> 00:54:20.399
Tyler: awesome. So that was kind of clear on what to expect next. So, [P10], I see we only have a few minutes left, and we've made it to the end of our prototype. So what we can do now is we can stop sharing our screen. So somewhere at the top of your screen, you're gonna see a bar.

477
00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.319
Tyler: and it'll say, stop sharing in red.

478
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:29.779
> P10: - 1: You see that you can go ahead and click on that, and then you'll be able to see me

479
00:54:29.980 --> 00:54:30.880
Tyler: perfect.

480
00:54:31.010 --> 00:54:37.399
Tyler: Well, we've got a couple of minutes left, and I just I'd love to reflect on what we just did

481
00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:42.359
Tyler: And yeah, how how you found it. What did you think of that process?

482
00:54:43.330 --> 00:54:54.909
> P10: - 1: I think it was a lot a lot easier than when I'm used to. I think it needs to be tweaked just a little bit. but otherwise I think it's it's a lot easier.

483
00:54:54.990 --> 00:54:59.030
Tyler: And what are you comparing it to. When you say it's easier than what I'm used to.

484
00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:01.110
> P10: - 1: It's just that

485
00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:04.639
> P10: - 1: just for

486
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:16.419
> P10: - 1: giggles, so to speak. I went on. The VABT. Ss website. which is for travel voucher

487
00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.130
> P10: - 1: and

488
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:24.819
> P10: - 1: had the most horrible experience. There was no explanation on how to do anything

489
00:55:24.830 --> 00:55:27.229
Tyler: on that webpage? Nothing.

490
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:28.280
Tyler: Okay.

491
00:55:28.310 --> 00:55:32.909
> P10: - 1: and that's probably why I signed up for this first place, because

492
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:41.579
> P10: - 1: II totally messed that that up. And right now the poor travel about. You're down the lead just trying to figure out what happened.

493
00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:49.010
> P10: - 1: put in travel vouchers like 7 times just to get it right. Finally.

494
00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:55.380
Tyler: right? A whole bunch of other ones are going through and throwing out.

495
00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:58.160
> P10: - 1: So that's why it just

496
00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:01.679
> P10: - 1: the Va needs to realize that

497
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:21.960
> P10: - 1: some people are computer literate. Some people use the computer. But if you don't put little things in to explain what to do, it's going to be a big mess. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So your your previous experience of trying to send the travel or apply for the travel voucher.

498
00:56:22.050 --> 00:56:27.259
Tyler: Was way more complicated, and this felt maybe more descriptive.

499
00:56:27.310 --> 00:56:33.899
Tyler: Yes. yeah, that that makes sense and sorry that you had that frustrating experience.

500
00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:41.380
Tyler: do you think that there's things? Is there anything in the form in this form that we talked about today. That made it a little bit easier.

501
00:56:41.740 --> 00:56:45.119
> P10: - 1: It's just that they made it

502
00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:55.629
> P10: - 1: a little bit more easier that you know what steps you're taking. You know how far you're in the steps, and you know what to do. And if there's a problem call

503
00:56:55.650 --> 00:56:57.460
Tyler: Umhm, and

504
00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:09.729
> P10: - 1: I hate when I have to do something with the Va. And it says nothing with the btss, did it, said nothing, and I don't know

505
00:57:09.770 --> 00:57:17.650
> P10: - 1: how that got about, because I have never been on the website. So confusing.

506
00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:42.089
Tyler: Yeah, so you like that, you know where to go if you need help you. You know what the page is about, what you need to do on the page, and then kind of how far you are in the process. That's really helpful. But II just have kind of one more question, because I know we need to wrap up. But we talked about your progress through the form a couple of times when you would tell me I'm I think I'm about halfway done. I think I'm about 3 quarters of the way done.

507
00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:52.989
Tyler: so that was kind of an estimate, right? Cause. You didn't have a specific idea of what what step you were on. How did you feel about having an estimate versus having a specific step.

508
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:59.090
> P10: - 1: II like that. It was an estimate, you know, and and and

509
00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:01.179
> P10: - 1: it felt I'm pulled up.

510
00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:07.289
> P10: - 1: Yup, I got you medication time.

511
00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:20.939
> P10: - 1: it's just that it felt good to the bob is doing the steps. I could see that I'm getting near the end, or I'm halfway. It felt like, okay, I'm getting somewhere. That's most important. When you're doing these forms

512
00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:26.549
> P10: - 1: because people get bogged down doing them. And they don't know where they're at.

513
00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:36.219
Tyler: Yeah, that helps. That helps. It's a little bit like motivating to know just generally that you're you're moving forward in the form. Yeah.

514
00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:51.549
Tyler: that makes sense. Well, [P10], I've asked you a ton of questions. I know we're kind of at time, but I want to leave some space in case you want to ask me any questions. I know this is your first time taking part in research. You can ask me questions about that or or anything else.

515
00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:54.090
> P10: - 1: Nope, I think

516
00:58:54.250 --> 00:58:58.510
> P10: - 1: we hit the nail right on the head. I thank you very much for letting me do this.

517
00:58:58.570 --> 00:59:13.370
Tyler: Oh, well, thank you. It was super helpful. And I hope you keep participating in in future research with the Va. Because your insight was really useful. You noticed lots of of different things that I didn't notice. And I really enjoyed chatting with you. Thank you.

518
00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:42.509
Tyler: Awesome. Well, before you go, perigee, and they're the folks who set up this research session. They're gonna send you a thank you note, and they'll give you some information if you want to pass it on to other veterans in case they'd also like to sign up to to take part in research. If you have any, follow up questions, you can let them know. And otherwise. Yeah, I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. Don't forget to take your medication.
