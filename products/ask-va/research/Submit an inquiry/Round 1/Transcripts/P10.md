Research study: [Submit an inquiry (Round 1)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/research/Submit%20an%20inquiry/Round%201)

## Transcript - NEED TO CLEAN UP

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay, awesome. So I'm gonna start the recording and then once I do that, I'm just gonna ask you to confirm one more time.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Yes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Alright, so are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today? Thank you. Do you have any questions for me at this point, P10?

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
None that I could think of.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay, awesome. Well, we got through all the beginning bit, so I know that was a lot of information, but if anything comes up, just let me know.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Before we jump into the prototype that I mentioned, we're going to look at together. I'd just like to learn a little bit more about you and your experience with the VA.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
How long have you been a veteran?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Oh boy, since, I got out of service in 1995, so I've been with the BA since about 1995 96.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Okay. And when you got out of service, did you start interacting with the VA right away or only in the last?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Couple of years.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Took about maybe about 2 years, give or take to get fully activated with.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Okay, awesome. Are you?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Where I was living with at the time is a little bit difficult because they were so far out.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Gotcha. Okay. And now are you like enrolled in healthcare? How are you interacting with the VA these days?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Mostly with healthcare.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Yeah, okay. Have you ever contacted the VA?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
How do you usually contact them?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Either. By email or by secure messaging through my healthy.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Okay, so you'll email them or you'll use secure messaging. That's really helpful.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Have you been using secure messaging for a while now?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
About a year.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Yeah, is there anything you like about it?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Huh, sometimes it's quick, sometimes slow.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Okay, and when you say go ahead.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The biggest problem I have is actually getting into it.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Yes, very different.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Okay, so signing in. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The old system that they had worked viewfully and for some strange reason. This new system that they got.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It's hit or miss sometimes.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Okay. So You're liking secure messaging. Sometimes it's quick to get a response and sometimes it's a bit slower.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Is that what you mean by slow? Okay, and then the sign in part is usually the biggest hurdle.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Yes.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Yeah, that's helpful. So that's really interesting that you're using secure messaging because what we're gonna talk about today and the prototype I'm going to show you is a little bit similar to secure messaging in that you know when you use secure messaging you generally have a question and you're seeking information from someone from the VA.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And in the case of secure messaging, it's obviously your care team. Right. And so what we're gonna be looking at today is a service called Ask VA and this might be a little bit different to secure messaging.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So throughout our conversation, feel free to bring a Comparisons if that's helpful. And I might even ask you more questions about secure messaging.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Okay. All right. So let's go ahead and get started. We're gonna set ourselves up.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Yep.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:28.000
With this prototype so I'm gonna send you it looks like you're in your computer right not your phone Okay, I'm gonna send you a link to the prototype in the Zoom chat.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Alright. Yep.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So you're gonna get this really big link. Good. Alright, so let's go ahead and open that on your computer.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Okay, you still here?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Yep, I'm still here so I can see you, but you might not be able to see my me while you're looking at Figma.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Yep.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So do you have that open now on your computer?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It's opening up now. Yep.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Okay, it's loading. So while that loads, why don't you come back to Zoom?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So can you find your Zoom window where you can see my face.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Okay.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Yep.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Okay, so you can see me now. Alright, have you shared your screen on Zoom before?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
No.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Okay, we'll do that together. So when you're on the zoom window where you can see my face if you look at the very bottom and I'll have a bunch of little icons and one of them in the middle is green.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Yep. Yep.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It says share screen. You see that one? You can go ahead and click on that and that's gonna ask you to choose your screen.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So you're gonna have to look for that. Link. Should have some blue.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Hmm. Says desktop one.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Yeah, that sounds right. That's probably what it is.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Okay.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Okay.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Although that could actually be your desktop, we'll see. I'll let you know. When I can see something.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Alright. Just so you know, I'm on the Mac. So. Okay.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Okay, so so far I'm not seeing your screen. But you take your time.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Okay, you see.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Okay. And I have whiteboard. On iPad, the iPhone iPad, Safari, that's where the Sigma was.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Yeah, let's why don't we try Safari. So if you click on Safari and then you click share in the bottom right corner of your window.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Okay.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Did that work?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I'm not seeing it yet, so tell me what you're seeing.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Oh, okay, hold up. Yeah. Hmm, hold up.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Let's see what's going on. I've never done this before, so.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000
No worries. Okay. No, that's okay. It's a lot of people's first time.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Yep.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So can you describe what you're seeing to me?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Okay.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Alright, so what it wants me to do is allow zoom to share or do things. And it says I have to quit zoom and start over.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Yeah, okay. I've had this happen before so you're gonna have to give permission to zoom.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Do you wanna try and give this a go with me?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Sure.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Okay.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Okay, so you're gonna you're gonna have to leave zoom so we won't be able to talk while you do this but When you close Zoom, you can open your, it should open your system preferences on your Mac.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Okay.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Okay.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And then you're gonna have the Zoom. App it should open everything for you and you're gonna have to allow screen share and this whole time you're not going to be on zoom and then you're gonna have to come back to Zoom.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Yep.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So you probably had a link in your email to get into this meeting, right? Okay, cool. So you'll go ahead and just rejoin the meeting and I'll and I'll be waiting here.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Okay.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
If it doesn't work after a couple of minutes, just rejoin the meeting and we'll go from there, okay?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Okay. Yep.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Alright, I'll see you soon.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000
He has such a lovely smile. Oh my goodness, bring so much joy.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Yep.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, sorry you didn't get to say hi, MI was speeding through.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I know. I'm so sorry. I was on the phone call with my core and my other VAPO.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And I was like, guys, I have to go to a usability twisting session. Thank you.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Okay, no worries at all. If he's not able to share his screen, I'll just share my screen.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So we'll just give him a second, see how it goes.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Okay.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I'm surprised this is the first participant that I've seen that has faced this permission issue.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And, have you faced it before?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Yeah, not this study, but usually, there's always a couple of people. I see he's back, so I'm gonna let him in now.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Okay. Alright.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Hi, P10. Alright, it looks like we're back. How did that go?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I think it worked.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Okay, cool. So if you want to go ahead, your cameras off now. So just like we set up at the beginning, yeah, perfect.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Okay.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Now I can see you and now let's go ahead and try and share screen.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Okay.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Alright, alright, so I see it says desktop one and Safari launch meeting. And I can't remember where that was.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Yeah, that's okay. So what we can do is I'm just gonna send you the prototype again.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Okay.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Okay.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And that might be even simpler. So I'm going to send it in the Zoom chat. And you can open it up.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And then let me know, is that opening in Safari?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Hold up. Hold up, hold up. You and I don't wanna lose you.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Yeah, I know the feeling. Well, I can still hear you and see you, so.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Okay.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Hmm.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Perfect. It looks like I can see your screen now, so we're just gonna change tabs on Safari.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Okay.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Yeah.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So you could even close, do you know what I mean by change tabs? Okay, cool. So I'll give you a minute to.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
This 1 3.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Yeah, that looks like the right one. Desktop. Yeah, let's click on desktop prototype 2.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Okay.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Perfect. Awesome. We did it. Okay, so now I can see your screen.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Okay.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So I'm seeing the same thing as you and we're all set up. We're gonna just wait a minute before we click anything.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Okay.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So like I mentioned, this session is about getting your feedback. So we're gonna look through this website together.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:48.000
I'm gonna kind of guide you when we're ready to click on things, or sometimes I'm going to ask you to show me where you would click, okay?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Okay.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So on this page, I'm just going to give you a minute to look around. We're not going to click on anything, but you're welcome to scroll.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Right.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And I'd love for you to tell me what you notice first.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Let's see. Well, the biggest thing I notice is that it's a VA department of Veterans Affairs, so I know it's correct.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Okay.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And then I see the blue sign in box. And that's where they told me to sign in.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Okay.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And that's it.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Okay, that's really helpful. So you know you're on a VA website and you see a blue sign in box.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Yep.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Yes.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Which is where have you signed in before using that blue sign inbox Okay, so that looks familiar to you as well.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Awesome. And if we're looking at this page that we're on now. What is this page about?

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Says ask VA.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And it says get answers to your questions about VA benefits and services and upload documents online. You should receive those response in 7 days.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Okay. And why is that surprising?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Which is surprising. Okay. Cause usually the VA is sometimes faster than that.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Yeah.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Okay, so it feels a little bit long. That makes sense. Alright, and if If I told you, so for the rest of our conversation, we're gonna pretend like you have to ask the VA a question, okay?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So we're gonna say you recently noticed some problems with your hearing. And you want to ask the VA how to get your hearing checked.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Right.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So you don't know how to get your hearing checked. You just know you probably need to see an audiologist.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Okay.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Until we've come onto here to ask the VA what to do. So without clicking anything yet, can you tell me what you would do first?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Where would you click?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Let's see. I would probably sign in. To my account. And then I would hit.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Contact us under that.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Okay. That makes sense. So you first sign in up at the top and that with that blue button and you click contact us.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Okay, does it seem like you need to sign in in order to ask a question?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Usually. When you deal with the VA the way I was told and taught 5 is that.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Unless you sign into your account. It's just general and they don't tell you specifically for what's your problem.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So usually when I sign in, I want to sign in directly for what my problems and concerns are.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:51.000
That makes sense. That's really, that's really helpful. So your in your experience and from what the VA told you, signing in is gonna give you more specific information.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Right.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Okay. That makes sense. If we scroll down a little bit on this page.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Can you tell me what we're seeing here with this green button?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Can you describe this to me?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Signing in required if your questions about education benefits work study or debt. Need the sign in if your questions is about education bins for studying your debt.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Well, I guess they're talking about questions of education benefits. And work study in debt and the sign in if you have any questions about that.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Right, okay. So if your question is about your hearing.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Do you need to sign in?

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Hmm.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Hello.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Let's say, well, it's for benefits, I guess, maybe.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Okay, so if it's for benefits, does that mean we need to sign in?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Maybe not, maybe not.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Okay, so I'm sensing it's not super clear, right? It's, it's not an easy yes or no answer.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Yeah.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Yeah, that's really helpful. Let's scroll down a little bit further. I'm gonna move us along.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So if we go down here, we're gonna see a link that says you can continue without signing in.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Okay, do you see that link?

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Yep.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Alright, so why do you think that link is there? What does that mean?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Yeah.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
That's a good question. Continue without signing in. I don't think I would ever want to click that in the first place.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Okay. And that's because you described to me that signing in will get you more specific information.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Okay, that makes sense. Well, I think that's really clear. It sounds like definitely the first thing you would do is sign in.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:08.000
For today, we're gonna do something a little bit different. We're gonna see what it's like if we didn't sign in.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Okay. Alright.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:21.000
So we're gonna continue without signing in. You can go ahead and click on that. Alright. Okay, so now before we click anything else on this page, you can always feel free to scroll however you like.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I mentioned that we're asking the VA how to get your hearing checked. With that in mind, can you show me what you would do on this page?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
You can go ahead and click.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Well, I would probably hit a category.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Yeah, okay. Let's see what the. Huh.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And it says it's wired. So. I would probably hit that.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Okay.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
And let's see.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
What are we seeing here?

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Bunch of different,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Canada. And I would probably hit healthcare if it were for a hearing.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Okay.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Okay, let's choose healthcare. And then we'll just perfect.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Awesome, we'll just stay on this page for a second, a second before we continue. So that felt really quick for you to choose healthcare.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:27.000
How important do you think it is to answer this question?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Very important.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
How come?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Because the one thing that I'm knows with government websites, if you don't get to a particular spot right away.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
It's gonna get too confusing.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Okay. So you wanna make sure you're getting to the right spot so you gotta answer the question upfront correctly.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Okay, that makes sense. And at this point in the process, how long do you think this whole process is going to take to ask the VA a question about your hearing.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Hmm. Don't know. Yeah, that's kinda up in the air.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Okay. That's okay. Yes, I don't know is always a good answer. So let's click continue.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And now. We're seeing this page. Can you show me what you would do on this page?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Well, considering it would be my hearing, I would hit ideology and hearing aids.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Okay, let's choose that. And then how is this question different from the last one you answered?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
More direct.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
It's more direct. Okay, why do you think the VA is asking you this?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Well, it says get answers and questions about via benefits and services. And upload documents online. And we hit healthcare and audiology and hearing aids.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
So what I like about it is it's right there.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Yeah. So

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Like, I'm not searching for anything.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Okay, so you liked how it narrowed it down for you. Yeah, that makes sense. What, is this box here that says your category and topic?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
What is that?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Well, it's telling you that the category of topic is health care. So that's what you're at right now.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Yeah, is that useful for you? Why is that useful?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Because it's labeling what you're searching on there.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Okay, so it's showing you where this list of topics. 6. Okay. That makes sense.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Alright, let's go ahead and continue to the next page.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Okay, so. Can you show me what you would do on this page?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Well, I continue to scroll down. As your question. And that says, what is your question about?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:18.000
And then what's the selection for what your question is about? And you have I would look at is either my own VA benefits or a general question.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Since most of the time when I go to the VA, I'm asking about myself. I would probably hit my own VA benefits.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Okay, that's really helpful to hear how you're thinking about it. So. Because it's probably about yourself specifically, you're gonna choose my own benefits.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000
And then a general question, what would that maybe be for?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
I think that would be just a general question about everything. Go with it.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Okay, so wouldn't be focused on you. Would be more general. That makes sense to me.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:20:02.000
So let's choose my own VA benefits like you says. And at this point. How much longer do you think this forms gonna be?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Well, it says 2 of 4, so we're about halfway through, I think.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Yeah, okay. So it says like we're halfway through and we just noticed it says 2 of 4.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.000
That makes sense. Alright, and what do you think the the VI, needs to know from you?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Well, probably who I am and where I'm located.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Okay, who you are and where you're located. That makes sense. So let's click continue and we're gonna see what happens next.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Alright.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Okay. Why don't you go ahead and describe this page to me.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Well, it's still in their SBA. Again, the answers to questions about the benefits and services.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Hello, documents and online. And they want to know what the question the reason for contacting us.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
And they want to know what your question is.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Okay. So they want another reason you're contacting us and what your question is. Okay, that makes sense.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Yep.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:15.000
So let's look through these options. And then which one do you think you would choose?

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
No, it would probably be I have a question the first option

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Okay, let's click I have a question.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Why do you think the VA is asking you this?

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
You're contacting them.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
And you have a question.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Okay, so you think that the VA wants to confirm that you have a question. Okay, and what about these other options in the list?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Can you imagine choosing one of these other options maybe in a different scenario?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000
If you wanna say something nice, you have a complaint. Or have a suggestion.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Attended the town hall. Now I have a question. I don't never intended the town hall, so I have nothing of the anything about that.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Or you want to say something else.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Okay.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:20.000
I think, just had a I think it's just a little bit. Too much, you know what I mean?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Yeah, tell me more about that. Why is it a little bit too much?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Because if you're just contacting them with a question. You're just throwing in a couple of things in there that doesn't have anything to do with what it's asking.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
So it could get a little confusing.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Right, okay, It could get a little confusing. Okay, cause you came here to ask them a question and now there's these other things here.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Right.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Yeah, I can totally see that. Okay, let's click continue.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Okay.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
So.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Okay. And this is nice. So now you can put actually your question in.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Okay, so this is nice. Why is this nice?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Because it allows you to say in your words what you are here for.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Okay. So this is kind of a point in the process that you were maybe expecting and you're happy to see it.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Yeah.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Yeah, that makes sense. And so we can't actually type in this prototype.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:28.000
But it felt clear to you that here is where you would go and you type in your question, right?

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Okay, and at this point, let's say we type in your question. Before we hit continue, what else do you think the VA is going to ask you?

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Well, they're still gonna ask me who I am. And where I'm located. Cause they don't know those 2 things yet.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Right. Okay, so we're still looking for who you are and where you're located just like you said before.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Okay, and how much longer do you think the forms gonna be?

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Well, we're still about halfway.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000
We're in the second line here in this slip blue. So we're still having entered 3 or 4 yet.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Okay.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Hello, what I like is it has a 800 number down here, so if you get stuck you can call somebody.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
That's good.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Yeah. That's a great observation. So you just notice there's the 800 number and that way you wouldn't be kind of lost if you if you needed help.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Awesome. Okay, well, we'll pretend like we type in your question. We'll click continue.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Okay, we moved over one.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Yep.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000
We moved over one and are you talking about the bar? Okay, so we notice that pretty quickly. And what else are we noticing on this page?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.000
This is what I would expect. You know, are you a family member? Are you the veteran himself?

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
I would be hitting on the veteran.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Right, okay, so you're the veteran. You can go ahead and select I'm the veteran And why is the VA asking this?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Hello? It says it's gonna ask some personal information and we use this information to help us understand your question to find the answers you need.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Well, now they're starting to realize, okay, well, who are you and where are you?

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Okay, so it's kind of meeting your expectation of at some point they need to figure out who I am and where I am.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Alright, let's click continue.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Okay.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.000
This is one thing I could never understand why they always included this in here.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Yeah, does, is this feel familiar this question?

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:56.000
It feels familiar, but, I understand that some VA veterans are VA employees. I think the majority of us part.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Okay.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:05.000
I would expect this to be on more of a portal for VA employees, not for. For them for veterans.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Right, okay, so you think the majority of veterans are not employees, so why are they asking this?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Right.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Yeah. Why do you think that they are asking this?

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Because Maybe they need to find out if you work for them or not.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Yeah.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000
What impact do you think that'll have if you choose yes or no?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000
It's just that. I think with some people when they look at this, they get confused.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
And when I look at this, the first question in my mind is why is this here on a veterans website?

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:52.000
It should be on a VA employees website.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Yes.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
So it feels very out of place. Yeah, that's really helpful. That makes sense to me.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Well, what would you do if you had to answer this page? Can you show me?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Have a hit? No.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Okay, let's go ahead and click no. And we'll click continue.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
There right.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Okay, so describe to me what we're seeing here.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:25.000
My, personal information.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Right.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Okay, your personal information. And we're not going to actually type anything in like I said but let's look through these questions and I'd like to know if anything stands out to you.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Okay. They want required sections of first and last name. Good. Which I think is, Mr. They'd like a preferred name or not really.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Required they want your social security number. Okay, and service number. The service number I I've always wondered about because I'm 55 and I know when I was in the Navy I was the last group of people that got a service number back in 1986 and they haven't used service numbers since 86.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000
So I think the vast majority of people don't even know what the service number is anymore.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000
Right. Yeah, no, that's a really good point. What would happen if you don't know your service number, what would you do on this page?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Put in my normal social security number.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Okay. So you only need to put in one or Okay.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Yeah.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Yeah. I mean service numbers, most veterans don't remember them or know them. I mean, up until.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000
1997, I used to know it, but after that, I never used it anymore.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
That forgotten long time ago.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Right. So you don't even have that. Right, okay, so you would put your Social Security number in.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Because you don't even know your service number at this point. Do you have an Right, that makes sense.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Not any Probably most veterans don't.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Yeah, yeah, I think you're probably right there.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
And after 8 86, they never issue them anymore.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Do you, do you have any hesitation about? Putting your social security number in?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Why do you think the VA needs that?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Because they need to specifically know who you are.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Right.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Okay, so they're trying to identify you. That makes sense. Okay, let's keep looking at these fields and keep telling me how you're, seeing them.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Okay, date of birth, that's obvious. They always want to know what year you were born.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Pronouns. I used to go to, I used to work for the city of Pittsfield and they started this section.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:50.000
So I know pretty much about pronounced. So I know that's part of diversity and all that stuff.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:07.000
So it's good to see it. But and also. On a personal level, it's not really necessary, but it's good to see it on the diverse.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Okay. Gotcha. That's helpful. So you said on a diversity level, it's good to see this on a personal level, it's not necessary.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Yes.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Yeah, that's helpful. Okay. And then anything else we're seeing here?

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Again, with gender identity, it's good to see it all the diversity level. But personal level, not necessary.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Okay, yes, that makes sense. So you don't need to tell me how you would answer these questions, but would you choose to answer them or would you choose like prefer not to answer?

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:50.000
I would probably answer it, but, Then again, maybe prefer not to either.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
It's a flip of a coin.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Yeah, that makes sense, especially because you said it's not necessary for you that this is here.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000
But also you recognize why it might be here. Okay, well let's go ahead and continue.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:13.000
We're gonna go on to the next page. We're gonna pretend like we put in all your information.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Okay, still under personal information.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Yep.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Okay, so we just noticed the progress still says personal information. And, and why don't you describe this page to me?

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000
What are we seeing now?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:38.000
It says, And it says, search by name or search by location. So that's a good thing because now they want to know where you are.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Right. And that's something you'd been waiting for them to ask you. Why do you think they need to know where you are?

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Because I don't think they will be the send me to a VA up in Alaska.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Right, so they wanna be able to send you to the right VA. That makes sense.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000
And you mentioned it says search by name and it says search by location. Okay, what's the difference between those?

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Can you describe them to me?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Well, every VA facility has some sort in name. Okay. Right now at the top of my head, I can't remember what the name of my VA facility is.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
So it'd be better to search by location.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Okay. And so when you say they have a name, let's pretend like I've never heard of VA medical centers before.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Are you saying the name is like the Los Angeles VA or it's a different type of name that's hard to remember.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Well, I know that the VA down in Leeds, Massachusetts, which is the one I go to, they just named it after a veteran himself.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Okay.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:59.000
And. I just can't remember. So, I've always referred to it since I come up here from Pennsylvania.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Right, okay.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:10.000
I've always referred to it as a Leeds VA. And that's how most people remember it.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Yeah.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
But, I'm trying to think of, what's that name? Something like Boland, I think they need that after, You know what I mean?

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
I can't remember the thing. So it's better for me to do it by location.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:23.000
I totally know what you mean, yeah. Yeah, you call it, you basically. Right, right, right, right.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Hmm.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
So you're basically calling it the location. You're not actually calling it. It's name, which is a veterans name that might be harder to remember.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Right.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
That that's really useful. So usually you would search by location and would you type in like Your city, how would you search by location?

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000
What would you expect to do?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
I would search in by city and state.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
City and state. Okay. Okay, great. So for today we're gonna switch things up because I know this is not normally how you would search.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Well now I know. But we're gonna pretend like we are searching by name. And we can't type today so we're going to pretend like we're typing.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
And we're going to say that you started typing in James. You knew that was the beginning of the facility.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000
So if you click on that box where you'd usually type.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Right here, search.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
We're actually gonna click just to the left of that. Yeah, perfect. We'll click there.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Okay. Okay. Okay, there's James.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Yeah, okay, so you're gonna have to use some imagination. We just typed in James.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000
And now what are we seeing?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Yep. A whole bunch of James.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Okay. And then I saw your mouse went all the way over to search. Is that what you click next?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000
You think?

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Yeah, well, you scroll down here.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Okay.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
You can scroll down or you can click search. Okay. So. For the purposes of today, let's say your medical center is called James J.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Peters. Can you show me what you do next?

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Yep. Right here. I mean, hit that.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Okay, and now what are we seeing?

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
James J. Peters is lit up.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Okay, gotcha. So that means maybe you've chosen that one. We don't need to click anything else now, but what if you realize you've chosen the wrong one?

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000
So let's say you were like, wait, I don't live in New York anymore, that's my old facility.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
What would you do at this point?

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Hmm.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Yeah, absolutely. I would probably hit the back button. Hopefully that would correct the problem.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Right down here.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Okay. Which back button can you tell me where on your screen? The one down here.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Okay, so you'd probably hit the back button and hopefully that would correct the problem you said. Yeah, okay.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000
So we'll keep this one. We'll say your health facility is James J. Peters, and then we'll just click continue.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Okay.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Oops, that's lit over like that.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Okay, so at this point in the process, before we look at this page too closely, how much longer do you think the form is going to be?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Well, for a little over half, so hopefully it'll be over soon. 3 quarter so

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Yeah. Right. We're at 3 quarters.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Yeah. What other information do you think?

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Oh, they want an email and a phone number so, or phone number, an email. So that's obvious.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Yeah. Is there anything else you think we might see? Before the end of the form.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Let's see. Well, they have my name, they have my Social Security.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Did they get my address? I can't remember.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
I'm not gonna answer your question yet, but do you think they'd need your address?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Probably.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Why do you think they need your address?

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Well, so they can continue to give me more. Selections on what's around my area instead of New York.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Right. Okay, so they want you wanted to make sure it's like location specific. For you.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Yeah, that makes sense. If we compare this form to, for you. Yeah, that makes sense.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:23.000
If we compare this form to, maybe another this feel the same amount of, pages or the same length or longer or shorter.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
You will.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Let me think.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Well, I know right now it feels like it's a little longer because we're going piece by piece.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Yeah.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
But I think it would feel about the same.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Okay, yeah, so you're recognizing obviously us having a conversation while you do this is making it feel longer.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Hmm.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Yep.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
But maybe in a different setting it would feel the same. Okay, that makes sense. And now we're looking at this page.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Right.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:07.000
It says your phone number and email. We can't fill these in with this prototype, but do you have any hesitation about what you, what you're supposed to do on this page?

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Well, the one thing I've noticed in past VA. Forms that I filled out.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:21.000
If I don't fill it out specifically the way they want it, it locks up.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Hmm.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.000
And the one thing I have is that they always put.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Parentheses. Hmm. And I go right away and fill in my phone number and the first thing that pops up is it's not correct.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:51.000
So that's the one thing. They need to. Spell it out how they wanted.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Yeah, that's really helpful. So in other VA forums that you've filled out, you remember that sometimes when you type in your phone number, it doesn't accept the format.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Let's use it.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Right. Cause I put in. [3 numbers] dash [7 numbers] and that's it.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
No more dashes and it blinks in right away not acceptable for. Yeah.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Right. Okay. So you wish it would tell you if it's gonna not accept different formats, it needs to tell you the format.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Right. Yes.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Yeah, so you notice here that it doesn't tell you the format and you automatically are like, well, now I might type it in wrong.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Right.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Yeah, that's really helpful. And why is it asking for your phone number and email?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Well, because they want to get hold of them.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Okay, yeah, so they wanna get a hold of you so that feels clear that you would give both your phone number and your email.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Okay, let's go ahead and click continue.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Alright, still 3 quarter.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Okay.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Yeah, still 3 quarters and. Now what are we seeing here?

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Your contact preference. I'm expecting to see that's typical government.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Yeah, why do you think that's typical government?

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Because they wouldn't know how to contact you.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
And.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
The one thing I've also noticed in typical government is they only allow you to pick one.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Hmm.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:32.000
And to me, either by phone or email is acceptable. And so I hope that there's more than one you could pick.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Right, okay. And before we click here, does it look like you can choose one or more than one?

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
It looks like you can only pick one.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Okay, what makes you think you can only pick one? Can, can you describe that?

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Because it says how can we contact you, your contact preference. And it always says required and it always looks like one.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Alright.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Okay. So you would, you ideally would choose phone and email, but it looks like this is gonna only let you choose one option.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Right, okay, that's really helpful feedback. So you can in fact only choose one. On this form.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
If you had to choose, would you choose phone or email?

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Probably. Well, it's VA probably email. Would be easier.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Okay. Yeah. Why do you say it's VA? Probably emails.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Because on my phone, on my iPhone, I usually, if you're not in the contact, you're automatically going to voicemail and blocked.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Get it.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Okay, gotcha. So you wanna make sure that you, You would receive the right the phone phone call and you wouldn't if their phone number is not saved.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Right.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Okay, that makes sense. So emails a safer option because you don't know the phone number that's gonna be calling you.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:55.000
And are you expecting to get an email? Who are expecting to get an email from?

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Usually they send it, VA. Somebody. VA.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Dot or whatever, but usually I know it's from the VA.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Okay, so it'll be someone from VA. Gov or the VA. And you'll get an email from them.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Okay, that's really helpful. So I know you usually choose email or even phone and email, but for today.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
We're gonna do something a little different. We're gonna pretend like you'd prefer US mail.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
Okay.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000
This is really just so we can test this website. So let's click on US mail. And then we'll just click continue.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Alright.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Alright, and then let me know what you're seeing here.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Okay, still 3 quarter. Can't you where you receive bail? Okay.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
But tell me, tell me why you're laughing here.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Because I'm in the United States, I'm in Conness and I don't reside outside the United States or on the military base.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:09.000
So. Hi, I would think that. If they would say US mail, they would know that it's already coming from the United States.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Right, okay, so on the last screen you said US mail and now you're like obviously I'm in the United States.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Okay.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Right, so they shouldn't be asking this.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:31.000
And are they asking for your country or the country where the mail? Is coming from.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:42.000
So that's why I find it a little bit. Off too. Why are they asking this? And I want you to check that.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Right.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Right. Right, it felt repetitive. Yeah, that's really helpful. What does this mean where it says I received mail outside of the US?

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000
This, well.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
I would think

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Well, the only thing I know is that there's a lot of veterans in Costa Rica that I found on over the years.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Okay.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Okay. Yeah, okay. So not totally sure, but you think it might be like veterans you live in Costa Rica as an example.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Okay, cool. Well, let's, choose United States. You can show me how you choose United States here.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Okay, we go down here. Well, at the top and not all the way down under you. Positive.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Yeah, okay, so even though it kinda felt like it should be. Obvious or you don't even need to ask this question.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
At least it was pretty quick to find United see. Okay.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Right. 9 times out of 10, you got to scroll all the way down to you just to find the United States.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Right, yeah.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Nice, that it's at the top of the list and not all the way down at the bottom.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Right, yeah, that makes sense. That's good feedback. Let's click continue.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Okay.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Alright. Yeah, so we're still at 3 quarters. Is, is that kind of what you expect at this point?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Hmm, kind of the that we're getting finished.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Right.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Okay, so. Kind of feeling like it's ready to be done. And this is asking for your mailing address.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Does this look standard? Does this look different to how you usually put your mailing address in?

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
It looks pretty standard.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Looks pretty standard. Okay, well, we put your mailing address in, and then we'll just click continue.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Okay. Right.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Okay, it says we can't confirm your address.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Yeah, so what's it asking for you to do?

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:58.000
Confirm your address. And then it would ask you which. The one you entered in the suggestion address.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.000
So this is something that I found similar on US Postal website. So it makes sense.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Okay, so this is familiar from looking at the USPS website. It makes sense. Would you usually choose what you entered or the suggestion?

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
9 times out 10 I picked a suggestion.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Okay, so it looks like that's already chosen for you. So we'll click continue.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Okay.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Alright, so now what are we seeing?

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Editing answers.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
And you're only able to edit some answers on this page. You may need to return to an earlier page.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000
In the form they added some answers. Okay.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Okay, so what's the purpose of this page?

00:46:51.000 --> 00:47:01.000
I think it would be to verify what you're putting in.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Okay.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Okay. That makes sense. Let's look at your category and topic.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Okay.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Alright, so what are we seeing here?

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Healthcare and ideology, that's good.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.000
They got that right.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:26.000
They got that right? Okay, so that's, that's what you're expecting to see.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Okay, can you change this?

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
I don't see anywhere to change it.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Okay. So why are they showing you this?

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
To make sure what you're asking.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Okay.

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Let's choose, let's look at your question.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Okay. Oops.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Yeah, sorry, that's just the prototype. There you go.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Alright, and what are we saying here?

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Okay, my own that VA benefits. I have a question and I want that my hearing check and possibly to see hearing aids.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:22.000
How do I go about this? Okay. Yeah, they have an edit function in here.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.000
So if

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:32.000
So. Maybe I need to verify something out of here. Hopefully that would be what I would be able to edit.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Okay, so hopefully you'd be able to edit your question. Right, okay. Let's click on personal information.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Let's look at that one.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Okay.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.000
Okay, so just describe to me what we're looking at here.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:49:01.000
You VA employee, no. Name preferred name, social security number, 1997.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Hold on, Okay. Medical facility information, edit. That's good. Contact able to edit.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
That's good, mailing address, able to edit. Yep. That's something good.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Okay. So you're saying as you go through this you're saying able to edit that that's good.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Yep.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000
So you appreciate the ability to edit this information. Why is that?

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Because you never know, something wrong.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Right, okay. So it's helpful that while you're reviewing this, you can change something if you need to.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Let's pretend like you noticed your phone number was entered incorrectly. Can you show me what you would do here?

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Let's see. I probably hit this.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
And hopefully it will be allowing me to come in here and change this specifically.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Okay. Why don't we click edit?

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000
So we won't be able to type, but this is this kind of what you were thinking you'd see?

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Yep.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000
It sounds similar to what you described. Yeah. Okay. And it also looks like we could edit our email here.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Can we edit our contact preference?

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:32.000
See.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
No.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Okay, so we can I see where your mouse is so we found where the contact preferences but it doesn't look like we can edit it.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Right.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Why do you think that is?

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Because we made it that way in the old part or the other section.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Hmm, okay. So we chose US mail before and so we can't change it now. Okay.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Right.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Alright, well we'll click cancel. We'll just pretend like we didn't actually need to change anything.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Right here.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Yeah, that's perfect. And now we're just gonna submit your question. We're gonna say we're all done.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
We're ready to send this to the VA.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Okay.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Alright, I'll give you a minute to read this page.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Okay, let me know that the question was to made it successfully. And thanks, so many of the questions, the US Department of Peters.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Gives me a reference number. Which is what I would expect or from other websites. So that's a good thing.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Okay.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Yeah, calls me or I call the, I can say I have a reference number for this problem. Well, that's a good thing to have.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Right, okay, so the reference numbers particularly helpful because you can make sure you're talking about the same thing as the person on the phone or yeah, okay.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Alright. And the one thing I'm not seeing on here. Which would also be a good thing.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Yeah.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Usually on other websites and other especially on, say like the US Postal Service or other government websites.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:29.000
There's a little section that says you can print this page.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Okay. And what?

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:36.000
And what I would love to do is print that reference, you know.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Okay, so you wanna make sure the reference number save and so you wish that it said print this page.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Right. That would be beautiful.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Yeah, that makes sense. And, if not, if you, if you didn't, if you couldn't print this page, how would you know that you, how would you save your reference number?

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Yeah. Yeah, fair enough.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Well, it's a, so I would print the page anyway. Yeah. But, I would have to write this reference number down on a piece of paper if I didn't have this capability.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.000
And if I lose the paper, I'm out of luck.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Right, okay, so you would probably

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:27.000
So that's why I would print it and put it in the folder so I know where it's at.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Right, okay, so. You sound very organized. I'm also very organized. So I understand you wanting to print this out and make sure you definitely have your reference number.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000
And at this point in the process, what happens next?

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Let's see. I would be expecting an email confirmation. And it's nice that they're letting me know that I will receive a reply within 7 business days.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:02.000
Which usually the VA takes about a week, give or take.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Okay. Awesome. So that does kind of clear on what to expect next.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:17.000
So P10, I see we only have a few minutes left and we've made it to the end of our prototype.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Okay.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000
So what we can do now is we can stop sharing our screen. So somewhere at the top of your screen, you're gonna see a bar.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
And it'll say stop sharing in red.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
You see that? You can go ahead and click on that and then you'll be able to see me.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Yup. Yep.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Perfect. Well, we got a couple of minutes left and I just I'd love to reflect on what we just did.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:44.000
And yeah, how you found it. What did you think of that process?

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:51.000
I think it was a lot easier than when I'm used to. I think it needs to be tweaked just a little bit.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
But otherwise, I think it's it's a lot easier.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:00.000
And what are you comparing it to when you say it's easier than what I'm used to?

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:21.000
It's just that. Just, for, giggles, so to speak.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Hmm.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Hi, which is for travel voucher. And had the most horrible experience. There was no explanation on how to do anything.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000
Okay.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:42.000
On that web page, nothing. And that's probably why I signed up for this first place because I totally messed that up.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Right.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:50.000
And right now the port travel about your down the lead just trying to figure out what happened. I put in, travel vouchers like 7 times just to get it right, finally.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Right. Okay. So Okay.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:59.000
But now they have a whole bunch of other ones that are going through and throwing out. And So that's why it just.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:13.000
The VA needs to realize that Some people are computer literate, some people use the computer, but if you don't put little things in to explain what to do, it's going to be a big mess.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So your previous experience of trying to, send the travel or apply for the travel voucher.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Yes.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000
Was way more complicated and this felt maybe more descriptive. Yeah, that makes sense.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:42.000
And sorry that you had that frustrating experience. Do you think that there's things? Is there anything in the form in this form that we talked about today that made it a little bit easier?

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:49.000
It's just that. They made it. A little bit more easier that you know what steps you're taking.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:57.000
You know how far you're in the steps. And you know what to do and if there's a problem, call.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:13.000
And I hate when I have to do something with the VA and It says nothing. That's what the BTSS did.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Yeah.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
It said nothing. And I don't know. How that got about? I have never been on the website so confusing.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Yeah. So you like that you know where to go if you need help you know what the page is about, what you need to do on the page, you know what the page is about, what you need to do on the page, and then kind of how far you are in the process.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Right.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:34.000
That's really helpful. But I just have kind of one more question because I know we need to wrap up, but.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:40.000
We talked about your progress through the form a couple times when you would tell me. I think I'm about halfway done.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000
I think I'm about 3 quarters of the way done. So that was kind of an estimate, right?

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Yep.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Because you didn't have a specific idea of what, step you were on. How did you feel about having an estimate versus having a specific step?

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:05.000
I like that it was an estimate, you know, and It felt, when told up. Yep. I got you medication time.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Okay.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:17.000
It's just that it felt good to the while I was doing the steps I could see that I'm getting near the end.

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000
That makes sense.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
I'm halfway. It felt like, okay, I'm getting somewhere. That's most important when you're doing these forums.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Because people get bogged down doing them and they don't know where they're at. And that helps.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.000
It helps.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.000
Yeah. Right. It's a little bit like motivating to know just generally that you're moving forward in the form. Yeah.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Right.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:45.000
That makes sense. Well, P10, I've asked you a ton of questions. I know we're kind of at time, but I want to leave some space in case you want to ask me any questions.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:52.000
I know this is your first time taking part in research. You can ask me. Questions about that or anything else?

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:59.000
No, I think. We hit the mail right on the head. I thank you very much for letting me do this.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Oh, well, thank you. It was super helpful. And I hope you keep participating in future research with the VA because your insight was really useful.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:13.000
You notice lots of different things that I didn't notice and I really enjoyed chatting with you.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Thank you.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Awesome. Well, before you go, Per G and they're the folks who set up this research session.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:29.000
They're going to send you a thank you note and they'll give you some information. If you wanna pass it on to other veterans in case they'd also like to sign up to take part in research.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:37.000
If you have any follow up questions, you can let them know and otherwise, yeah, I hope you have a lovely rest of your day.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000
