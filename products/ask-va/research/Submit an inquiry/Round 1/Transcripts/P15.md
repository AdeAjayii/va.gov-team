## Transcript - NEED TO CLEAN UP

Tyler: Alright. So are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today?

2
00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:12.340
Tyler: Okay, awesome. So I know that was a lot of information. And I talked really fast, but we got through kind of

3
00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:24.139
Tyler: the the details of the session. And now I'm going to let Holly and Shelby into the session. And we can just say hello. So we've got Holly and Shelby that are joining us.

4
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.960
Tyler: Here's Holly, and

5
00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.470
Tyler: we'll just have a quick Hello! Once they get themselves set up.

6
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.240
Holly Hansen: Hi.

7
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.329
> P15:: Hello, Holly! I'm [P15]

8
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.249
Holly Hansen: [P15], so nice to meet you. Thank you for being here. Thank you for your service.

9
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.049
> P15:: Thank you for having me here with you today.

10
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.639
Tyler: Thanks, Holly, and we've also got Shelby here, Shelby, if you want to say a quick Hello.

11
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.830
ShelbyC: hey, [P15]! Nice to meet you.

12
00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.809
> P15:: Hi, Shelby. Nice to meet you, too. I'm [P15]

13
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:10.079
Tyler: awesome. So thanks, [P15]. So for the rest of the session, Shelby and Holly are gonna have their cameras off and they're gonna be on mute, and they're just listening in. And I see we also have Maria here. So now everybody's here, so we'll let Maria in.

14
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.040
Tyler: and we'll say a quick Hello!

15
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:25.990
Tyler: All right. There we go. Hi, Maria! I think she's still getting click connected, so we'll let her get settled. But she's gonna also be here observing, [P15]. Okay,

16
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.019
Tyler: alrighty. So do you have any questions for me at this point. That was a lot of information in a couple of minutes.

17
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.710
> P15:: No, not too many questions yet. Okay, cool. Well, if you have any, you just let me know.

18
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:48.909
Tyler: I think we're ready to get started. But before we start looking at that prototype I mentioned, I just want to get to know you a little bit better in your experience with the Va how long have you been a veteran?

19
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.920
> P15:: Since 2016,

20
00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.940
Tyler: cool? And did you start interacting with the Va. From 2016 or only in the last couple of years.

21
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:08.930
> P15:: I would probably say, since 2,016, I've started interacting.

22
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.110
Tyler: Do you ever contact the Va.

23
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.880
Tyler: yes, I do occasionally. Yeah. How do you usually contact the Va

24
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.660
> P15:: usually, I just call on my cell phone or something or email, maybe.

25
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.430
Tyler: Umhm, yeah.

26
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.579
Tyler: do you prefer to to call over emailing? Or what's your preference? Usually?

27
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.870
> P15:: Generally just call

28
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.480
Tyler: cool?

29
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:58.529
Tyler: Well, I think we'll talk more about that today. The the service that we're looking at is about contacting the Va like I said, and so we're looking to get feedback on things that maybe are a little bit confusing, or things that you find particularly helpful. So if you think about past experiences, you've had as we go through this, you're welcome to share those with me as well.

30
00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:05.899
> P15:: So let's go ahead and get you set up with this prototypes. I know you're on your phone sometimes. This is a little bit trickier. But

31
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:16.350
Tyler: I do appreciate you being on your phone because that helps us test how well this works. So I'm gonna send you a link to the prototype in the Zoom chat. It's gonna show up on your phone, probably right now.

32
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.620
Tyler: And when you see that show off if you just click on that link

33
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.610
Tyler: and then let me know when you've got that opened.

34
00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.400
Tyler: I think you're frozen.

35
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:49.490
> P15:: Oh, it looks like, it's open now. Okay, cool. So I think your picture is frozen. But as long as you can hear me, can you hear me? Okay?

36
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:51.410
> P15:: Yes, okay, cool

37
00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.980
Tyler: alright. So what we're gonna do now is share your screen on. Zoom. Have you done that before on your phone?

38
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.270
Tyler: Okay? So I'm gonna help walk you through it. So if you come back to the zoom app on your phone.

39
00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.809
Tyler: where you can kind of see my face.

40
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.099
Tyler: So you're back there. So there should be something towards the top. An option that says.

41
00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.170
Tyler: share screen

42
00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.880
Tyler: you seeing that option.

43
00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:26.710
> P15::  no, not yet, not yet. Okay.

44
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:39.140
> P15:: It always depends which phone you're on. So what are you seeing? Can you describe to me what you're seeing on the zoom? Okay, perfect. Yeah. If you share your screen.

45
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.979
Tyler:  we'll go ahead and do that

46
00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.309
Tyler: perfect. So now I think I'm seeing what you're seeing. It looks like it says, screen broadcast.

47
00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.369
> P15:: Yeah. And then if you go ahead and and navigate back to that prototype.

48
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:21.700
Tyler: So you that's always a little tricky. But there we go. I see it over there perfect. awesome. So now we're seeing the prototype, and we're seeing my face on top of the prototype. I'm going to have you move my face kind of out of the screen. Just so you can see more of the screen. So if you just kind of swipe it away. Yeah, perfect.

49
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.220
Tyler: And can you still hear me, [P15].

50
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.310
> P15:: Yes, I can. Okay, cool.

51
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.239
Tyler: alrighty. So I can see your screen. Now. It says, Ask Va.

52
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:39.809
Tyler:  and let's go ahead and start looking at this this page, so you can feel free to to scroll around. We're not going to click on anything yet.

53
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.380
Tyler: but I'm curious what you're noticing first.

54
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:52.070
> P15:: It looks pretty much like the standard Va website at first, glance

55
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.379
Tyler:  okay, so it looks familiar

56
00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.190
> P15:: yeah and it has like a bunch of options to log in and create an account.

57
00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.589
Tyler: Yeah. and what's this page? What's this page specifically about?

58
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:20.760
> P15:: To get more information for questions that you have regarding the Va and their services.

59
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:29.740
Tyler: Okay, cool. So this is a page for you to get answers to your questions. And it sounds like there's some information about signing in and setting up an account.

60
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:37.209
Tyler: Alright. So for the rest of our conversation today, I want you to pretend, like you need to ask the Va a question.

61
00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:47.890
Tyler: so we're gonna say that you've been noticing some problems with your hearing. And you wanna ask the Va. How to get your hearing checked? But you don't really know how how to do that. So

62
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:53.300
Tyler: you you want to ask them how to get your hearing checked. And you know you probably need to see an audiologist.

63
00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.010
Tyler: Okay, so without clicking anything. Yet can you tell me what you would do first?

64
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:04.130
> P15:: I would probably go

65
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:12.039
> P15:: to the search area like hearing or Audiology

66
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:24.630
> P15::  and see what popped up. And F. If that was too complicated or I wasn't figuring out the answer, I would probably just try to

67
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.340
> P15:: call the number where it says need help.

68
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:36.560
Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. And with, when when you say you would use the search, can you show me where you're seeing the search.

69
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:48.810
> P15:: I thought this was the search right here, but then I saw it said like reference number. So maybe it's

70
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.340
> P15:: function rather than like a general search. But that was the first.

71
00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:02.919
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So the first thing you do is try and have a search on. Va. Gov, to get the answer to your question.

72
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:07.399
> P15:: Yeah, that's what I would probably do. Yeah, that makes sense.

73
00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:14.769
Tyler: Alright. Let's say that you needed to use this service. So you needed to contact the Va using? Ask Va.

74
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.790
Tyler: so if we scroll up a little bit.

75
00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.810
Tyler:  what?

76
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.299
Tyler: Where would you click first to use this service. Askva.

77
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:34.560
> P15:: the hyperlink that says, Ask Askva, I click on that link up at the top. There.

78
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:36.859
> P15:: yeah, okay, cool.

79
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.579
Tyler: So let's say that you ended up on this page.

80
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:49.969
Tyler: You clicked on that hyperlink you ended up here. And what's next? Does it seem like you need to sign in.

81
00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:59.350
> P15:: Yep, I'm seeing like in bright green, it's pretty noticeable saying to sign in or create an account

82
00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:08.919
> P15:: below that it's still asking to sign in or create an account. So I would assume that I'd probably need to figure out my password information or

83
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.849
> P15:: create one if I didn't already have one set up.

84
00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:17.699
Tyler: Yeah, that that makes sense. I can see why it seems like that. What are the benefits of signing in?

85
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:30.549
> P15:: I'm guessing. I would assume they would have most of your information. If you were already enrolled in the Va healthcare system.

86
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:39.729
> P15:: they might have some of your previous doctor visits or some health issues that you were experiencing. And

87
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:54.030
> P15:: if you're able, sign in or log in, you may have access to your records and medical records and stuff of that nature.

88
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.430
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So

89
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:05.129
Tyler: it sounds like you would probably the first thing you do here is probably sign in. Maybe after you searched on your own on Va gov

90
00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:19.149
Tyler:  for today, we're actually gonna imagine that you're gonna continue without signing in. So we're gonna see what that process is like for you. So if you wanted to use Askpa and you didn't want to sign in, can you show me what you would do?

91
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:22.950
> P15:: And

92
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:28.700
> P15:: I go to continue without signing in

93
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.329
Tyler: hyperlink. Okay, why do you think that link is

94
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:35.269
Tyler: maybe smaller or less obvious?

95
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:45.529
> P15:: I think because the Va. Probably wants you to sign in. So in

96
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:54.540
> P15:: pull up your medical information or personal information to better assist you or help them help you

97
00:10:54.730 --> 00:11:02.970
Tyler: okay, that makes sense so it's maybe a little bit less obvious because the Va. Is trying to get you to sign in. They're encouraging you to do that.

98
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:04.179
> P15:: Yeah, that

99
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.650
Tyler: thanks. That's really helpful. So let's click on. Continue without signing in.

100
00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.930
> P15:: Okay, okay, so now we're on a new page

101
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:21.699
Tyler: and remembering your questions about getting your hearing checked. So with that in mind, can you show me what you would do on this page?

102
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:30.159
> P15:: The first? The first thing I'm seeing is select a category.

103
00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:32.970
> P15:: So I would. Oh, click on that.

104
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.640
> P15:: And then.

105
00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:45.509
> P15:: it's kind of like general categories. So I since it's more of a health issue for audiology, I'd click on healthcare.

106
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:49.569
Tyler: Okay, cool. Let's sit on. Let's stay here for a second. Now

107
00:11:50.010 --> 00:12:00.649
Tyler: that was really helpful the way you described it to me. Out loud. So you you chose a category, said there, maybe more general categories, and you think that this would fit under healthcare.

108
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.899
Tyler: How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly.

109
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.070
> P15:: I would say it's

110
00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:14.570
> P15:: very important, because if you are looking for

111
00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:19.260
> P15:: if you picked another option it would probably take you

112
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:27.340
> P15:: more down the path of something totally irrelevant to what you're looking for answers for, or information for.

113
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.670
Tyler: Yeah.

114
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:42.839
Tyler: that makes sense. So you're gonna go down a certain path, and you want to start down the right path. Okay, cool. And when we're just on this page. Now, how much longer do you think this is going to take for you to get to the end?

115
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:52.999
> P15:: I, it says, for one of 4 steps. So I'm assuming it's probably gonna be pretty quick, because they seem like simple

116
00:12:53.370 --> 00:13:01.990
> P15:: options or questions that they're asking. So maybe 30 s to a minute to get through steps.

117
00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:12.469
Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. So you saw it, says one of 4. And that feels like it's gonna be 4 more steps. So far they've been really, they've been like a simple step. So it feels quick.

118
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:16.310
Tyler: Okay, cool. That's really helpful. Let's click on. Continue

119
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:24.029
Tyler: alright. Can you describe what you're seeing here?

120
00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:41.769
> P15::  now, it's kinda took you in the path of healthcare. It's kinda taking you into a sub category of the general category of healthcare. So it's showing different departments that you may be interested in

121
00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.879
> P15:: getting help with. So I'm seeing

122
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.849
> P15:: ology and hearing aids

123
00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:54.860
> P15:: in alphabetical order. So that's helpful. And if I was looking for something with my hearing that would probably be my

124
00:13:54.990 --> 00:14:07.110
Tyler: next step would be to select that option. Yeah, okay, cool. So that was that was really clear to me, you're you're saying that this is basically getting more specific compared to the last page about healthcare.

125
00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:17.170
Tyler: And you told me which one you would choose in this scenario, which would be the the first one Audiology. Let's go ahead and click on that.

126
00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:26.429
Tyler: And what if you couldn't find an option that fit your needs. What would you do? So I know we could find one here. But.

127
00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.189
> P15::  Nope, we're on the next page.

128
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:35.939
Tyler: That's okay. Let's go ahead and we'll we'll start on this page. Oh, okay.

129
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:41.329
Tyler: we're back. So if you can find something that fit your needs, what would you do here?

130
00:14:43.010 --> 00:14:47.409
> P15:: I would probably go back to

131
00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:56.139
> P15:: kind of back me out to see if I can select the right category or the one that better fits my needs.

132
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.250
Tyler: Okay?

133
00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:02.109
Tyler: So you would probably assume that maybe you'd chosen the wrong category.

134
00:15:02.910 --> 00:15:05.629
> P15:: Yeah, okay.

135
00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:12.650
Tyler: cool. Let's click. Continue. We'll go to this next screen. Can you describe this screen to me.

136
00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:19.979
> P15:: It's the second step of trying to figure out my question.

137
00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:29.539
> P15:: it has 3 simple options about what my question is about. Is it about Va. Benefits, someone else's benefits or a general question.

138
00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.240
> P15:: Umhm.

139
00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.790
> P15:: So if I was trying to figure out more information on my hearing issue.

140
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:45.110
> P15:: I would probably select my own VA. Benefits, because I know I'm enrolled in the VA healthcare system.

141
00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:47.720
Tyler: Okay? Yeah. So

142
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:52.930
Tyler: because you know, you're enrolled in healthcare, you would choose my own benefits.

143
00:15:52.990 --> 00:16:05.649
Tyler: let's take a step out of the scenario for a second. What if you weren't enrolled in healthcare? And you had a question. Maybe it was about enrollment or eligibility. Which option would you choose in that scenario?

144
00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.980
> P15:: I probably pick general question because

145
00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:24.160
> P15::  I would be kinda concerned about clicking on my own Va. Benefits, because I probably wouldn't be sure if I qualified for them or had them or was enrolled or not.

146
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.639
> P15:: So I probably just try to say it's a general question.

147
00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:36.659
Tyler: Yeah, I think that's really, that's really clear. Okay, well, let's go ahead and choose my own Va benefits like you said.

148
00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:39.259
Tyler: And then we'll click. Continue.

149
00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:41.950
> P15:: Okay.

150
00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.699
Tyler: okay, so what are we seeing here?

151
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:49.909
> P15:: It's still continuing down the pathway of

152
00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.599
> P15:: healthcare and the Audiology question.

153
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:58.609
> P15:: So that now it's asking the reason why you're contacting the Va.

154
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:05.159
> P15:: And there's several options from like, I have a question. I wanna leave a compliment.

155
00:17:05.230 --> 00:17:08.060
> P15:: suggestion or other.

156
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:13.629
Tyler:  okay? And why? Why? Do you think the va is asking you this question.

157
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:21.149
> P15::  to find out more information as to

158
00:17:21.339 --> 00:17:22.980
> P15:: what exactly

159
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:35.629
> P15:: you are trying to contact the Va with and what your concern is primarily for inquiring with the Va. So that they try to better assist you.

160
00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:36.920
Tyler: Okay?

161
00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:41.870
Tyler: So it feels like answering. This might help the Va know what you're gonna

162
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.330
Tyler: contact them about.

163
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.780
> P15:: Yeah. Okay.

164
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:49.260
Tyler: what would you choose in this scenario.

165
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:56.670
Tyler: I would say, I have a question.

166
00:17:59.450 --> 00:18:01.580
Tyler: Okay, let's click. I have a question.

167
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:09.409
Tyler: Alright. We'll keep going. Yeah, awesome.

168
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:14.539
Tyler: Alright. Why don't you describe this page to me, what would you do on this page?

169
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.899
> P15:: I would type out.

170
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:23.009
> P15:: since the only option is to type out like a text response.

171
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:31.610
> P15:: my concern about my hearing that I am experiencing. I try to be as detailed as possible, so that

172
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:38.400
> P15:: the VA. Could try to help me or point me in the right direction, so I can

173
00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:44.479
> P15:: get the proper attention that I need through the Va. For my issue.

174
00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:52.649
Tyler: Cool. So you would type in your question here, and you, being specific, might help you help them kind of like how you

175
00:18:52.790 --> 00:19:00.010
Tyler: said earlier on that that makes sense. And this felt pretty straightforward. You could tell right away that this is something you would type in

176
00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:09.419
Tyler:  at this point in the form let's say that we typed in your question. We're not actually gonna type it in in this prototype.

177
00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:12.839
Tyler: How much longer do you think that the form is going to be?

178
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.409
> P15::  I would say.

179
00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:22.730
> P15:: probably

180
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.160
> P15:: 2 to 5 min. It seems like

181
00:19:27.170 --> 00:19:33.179
> P15:: the questions are getting a little bit more detailed and specific and

182
00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.319
> P15:: based on the 2 of 4

183
00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:52.270
> P15:: at the top. It seems like it's not progressing as quick as I thought, and within each category of one through 4. It's kinda keep continuing down a path of asking more questions and getting more details and information from you.

184
00:19:52.520 --> 00:20:04.379
Tyler: Right? Okay, that's really, that's really interesting. So earlier, we thought it might be like 30 s. But then, as you've went on, you've realized that the form is getting more specific than you might have thought, and it's

185
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:09.899
Tyler: inside like 2 of 4. There might be multiple things.

186
00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:15.190
> P15:: Yeah, that that makes a lot of sense. I think that's really helpful.

187
00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.790
Tyler: all right. Well, let's go ahead and we'll we'll pretend, like we typed in your question. We'll just click. Continue.

188
00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:27.459
Tyler: Okay. So what are we noticing here?

189
00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:40.020
> P15::  now, they're asking for personal information and step 3. They want to know exactly who they're talking to with

190
00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:45.699
> P15:: the person inquiring is the veteran or family member

191
00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:51.580
Tyler: of the veteran. Okay? So in your case, what would you choose?

192
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.279
> P15:: I choose on the veteran.

193
00:20:55.860 --> 00:20:58.300
Tyler: Why do you think the VA. Wants to know this?

194
00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.790
> P15:: So that they can tell exactly who

195
00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.829
> P15:: they are talking to

196
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:11.700
> P15:: and who needs assistance?

197
00:21:12.170 --> 00:21:20.130
Tyler:  yeah. So this way, they know they're talking to the veteran about their benefits,

198
00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:24.469
Tyler: alright, is there anything else on this page that you notice

199
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.340
Tyler: mentioned the the 3 of 4 personal information changed.

200
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:39.170
> P15:: Yeah, now, we're on 3 or 4. It's starting off with kind of a simple

201
00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:49.049
> P15:: basic question. So now I'm assuming, like, it'll continue down more questions about personal information

202
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:50.939
> P15:: in the coming questions.

203
00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:58.430
Tyler: Yeah, what kinds of things. Could you imagine they're gonna ask you in their personal information?

204
00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:11.080
> P15:: Like your address so they can figure out where you live and what the closest hospital or care center is located to you.

205
00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:21.040
> P15:: which could also help them figure out, your healthcare, team and doctors appointment times and Dates.  

206
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.430
> P15:: they might also want to know, like

207
00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:29.009
> P15:: your recent medical history.

208
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:40.829
> P15:: Like, how you are generally feeling. If you've had any changes in your medical history over the last couple of years that would be important for them to know about to, so that they can better assist you.

209
00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:44.870
Tyler: Umhm. Okay, that's really helpful. So lots of different questions.

210
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:50.959
Tyler: Especially about your medical history, your location to help

211
00:22:51.050 --> 00:23:00.720
Tyler: them get you to the right care center or or place, and then also know kind of some of your medical history.

212
00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:06.449
Tyler: So if we think back to the beginning, when we started, we chose not to sign in right.

213
00:23:06.530 --> 00:23:11.420
Tyler: Do you think that has any impact on the questions they're gonna ask you?

214
00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:22.820
> P15::  I think it would probably have impacts, because if he didn't sign in.

215
00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:29.690
> P15:: You're not gonna have all of your personal information kind of pre

216
00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:46.530
> P15:: kinda like saved in onto your profile. So the Va is not gonna know exactly who you are, what who they're talking to, or what your medical history is. So they're gonna need to find that and kinda and kind of

217
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.640
> P15:: pride out of you in order to get the help that you need.

218
00:23:50.730 --> 00:24:02.849
Tyler: Right? Okay? So if you signed in, then they might be able to get some of that information from your profile, but because you didn't sign in, they need to ask you for more things.

219
00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:10.880
Tyler: Yeah, okay, cool. Thanks. That's really helpful. Let's let's click on. Continue, we'll we'll go to the next page now

220
00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:15.389
Tyler: and then walk me through what we're seeing now.

221
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:23.140
> P15:: It's asking if you are currently a Va employee question.

222
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:28.840
Tyler: Yeah. So it's a simple question, why do you think the Va. Wants to know whether you're an employee?

223
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:36.089
> P15:: Ii really don't know about that one

224
00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:41.009
> P15:: Maybe they can find you in the system, or

225
00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:44.390
> P15:: better, if they know you're an employee. But

226
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:47.210
> P15:: I'm not real sure why they would need to know that.

227
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:54.860
Tyler: Yeah. So even though it's a simple question for you to answer, it's not totally clear. Why? Why? You would need to answer this.

228
00:24:55.550 --> 00:24:57.889
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, okay.

229
00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.859
Tyler: we'll go ahead and answer this question, and then we'll we'll click. Continue

230
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:07.510
> P15:: right?

231
00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:20.539
Tyler: So we're not actually gonna type anything in on this page. But let's look through these questions together, and I'd like to know if things start standing out to you. So as you scroll, you can kind of just tell me what you're looking at and what you're thinking.

232
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:29.120
> P15:: It's asking pretty basic personal information questions like your name. your social

233
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.480
> P15:: date of birth.

234
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:38.480
> P15::  how you prefer to call yourself

235
00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:42.199
> P15::  your gender.

236
00:25:44.130 --> 00:25:53.129
Tyler: And that's all i'm seeing so far so you said, it starts pretty basic information,

237
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.659
Tyler: we've got first and last name. Here, let's look at social security number a little bit.

238
00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:05.199
Tyler: So why is the Va. Asking for your social security number?

239
00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.719
> P15:: I'm assuming so that they can

240
00:26:10.310 --> 00:26:20.340
> P15:: find out your identity. And to see if you're enrolled in Va, healthcare and to verify your service and benefits

241
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:31.849
Tyler: okay so they need a way to verify. You are who you say you are? Okay. And then what about service number? Do you know what the service number might be?

242
00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.750
Tyler: Sounds familiar.

243
00:26:35.870 --> 00:26:40.689
> P15:: I'm assuming it's like your military service number that

244
00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.980
> P15:: you were probably assigned when you enlisted.

245
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.090
> P15:: but I can say I don't

246
00:26:49.120 --> 00:27:00.119
> P15:: really recall that when I enlisted, or when I was serving from 2012 to 2016. And I definitely don't know that number or, remember it if it was given to me.

247
00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:03.270
Tyler:  yeah, that makes sense. So

248
00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:11.870
Tyler: social security numbers may be an easier one to have as a reference service number not sure that we remember it and

249
00:27:11.890 --> 00:27:16.109
Tyler: not even really sure. Maybe if you had been given a service number

250
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:20.940
Tyler: so in this case, do you need to have both your social security and your service number.

251
00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:27.420
> P15:: It just says, provide one of the following. So

252
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:39.920
Tyler: provide my social sense. I know that. Yeah, okay. is there any other identity number from your experience, having been in the military now, being a veteran

253
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:43.759
Tyler: that you would prefer to give instead of your social security number.

254
00:27:45.970 --> 00:27:52.930
> P15::  no, I can't really think of like any number, any numbers

255
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:57.139
> P15:: I may. I probably did have some kind of service number, but

256
00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:04.530
> P15:: it definitely wasn't really in use when I was serving, and I never needed it.

257
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:05.880
> P15:: so

258
00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:10.710
> P15:: I know my social. And I'm comfortable with that for

259
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.840
> P15:: purposes. So I'm more than comfortable just using my social

260
00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.470
Tyler: cool. Okay?

261
00:28:16.650 --> 00:28:19.150
Tyler: And if I say

262
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:29.400
Tyler: this number, let me know if this sounds familiar to you, or it sounds like something you you're not. You don't remember, or you don't. Have you heard of a Dod Edip? I number.

263
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:32.009
> P15:: Yes, okay.

264
00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:40.250
Tyler: Is that something that you would have like as a reference or social security number is still a more obvious one for you.

265
00:28:41.350 --> 00:28:47.880
> P15:: Yeah. Now that you mentioned that one, I do kind of remember having that. But

266
00:28:48.550 --> 00:29:16.929
> P15:: I definitely didn't have it memorized is probably just on like my Id or something, and I never really used it or never really needed it. So I would still primarily prefer. Just use my social because I know that and use it more in my daily life. Yeah, okay, that's really helpful. So your Dod Edip number, you would have to go find it. It would be a lot more difficult than asking for your social security number.

267
00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:18.360
> P15:: Yes, exactly.

268
00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:23.929
Tyler: Okay, cool and then we can keep scrolling down. So we've got date of birth here.

269
00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.240
Tyler: Then we've got our pronouns. Would you choose to answer the pronouns?

270
00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:38.429
> P15:: I would probably, if who, I guess, since it says required, I just say use my preferred name

271
00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:39.540
Tyler: cool.

272
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:45.470
Tyler: and then we've got gender. Same same question here. Would you choose to answer your gender?

273
00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:51.549
> P15:: Yeah, I would just say, man, how I prefer the

274
00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:54.990
Tyler: identified or whatever.

275
00:29:55.260 --> 00:30:03.219
Tyler: Alright. Well, this felt pretty straightforward. We're gonna pretend like you filled all these these fields in and we're gonna click, continue.

276
00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:05.220
> P15:: Okay.

277
00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:11.299
Tyler: alright. So now, what is the Va asking for?

278
00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:23.799
> P15:: It's trying to help you figure out your. I guess, nearest via health, facility, or most convenient facility.

279
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:29.520
> P15:: So it has a couple of options where you can search by the name or

280
00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:32.570
> P15:: by location.

281
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:37.969
Tyler: So this is trying to help you find your facility. If if you know you're enrolled in.

282
00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:40.830
Tyler: I think you're enrolled in healthcare right with the Va.

283
00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:55.109
Tyler: You are okay. So as somebody who's enrolled in in Va healthcare you don't have to tell me the name of the facility. But do you know the name of your facility? Okay, so would you need to use this search?

284
00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.860
> P15::  I don't think

285
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:03.830
> P15::  I guess

286
00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:05.549
> P15:: I probably would just

287
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:17.649
> P15:: start typing in like I'm from Cincinnati, and I use the Va. Cincinnati Medical Center start typing that in to see if it auto populated. Not

288
00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:25.689
> P15:: cause I'm not totally sure what the official name is. I'd probably just put like my Zip code in, and I'd be able to locate it pretty easily, I think?

289
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:38.220
Tyler: Yeah, that that's really helpful. So you know, when you started, and you said I would probably start by looking for like Cincinnati, va.  would you type that into the name search by name.

290
00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:49.390
Tyler: Yes, cool. Okay, cool that's really helpful. So here you would type in like Cincinnati, and hope that it shows up. If it doesn't, you would type in your postal code

291
00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.230
Tyler: in the search by location.

292
00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:56.370
> P15:: Awesome thanks. That's that details really helpful for me.

293
00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:13.819
Tyler: Okay. So for today, we're gonna pretend like you're you're searching by name. So go ahead and and go back to search by name. And we can't type in the prototype today. But what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like, I know, this isn't necessarily case. We're gonna pretend like your facility. It starts with the word James.

294
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:20.889
Tyler: So if you click where you would type, you can just tap that once it'll so pretend like we've typed in James.

295
00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.210
> P15:: So what are we seeing now?

296
00:32:23.890 --> 00:32:29.519
> P15:: It looks like it. Kind of populated a several different

297
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:36.739
> P15:: healthcare centers throughout the country that had the name James in the

298
00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:40.910
Tyler: do these names like the the list we're seeing here? Does does that look

299
00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:45.720
Tyler: a little bit like the format of your Va facilities? Name?

300
00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:53.049
Tyler: I would say so. Yes. Does it have like a longer name? Maybe it's the name of a person.

301
00:32:54.110 --> 00:33:01.140
> P15::  I would say. Yes, I'm not. I don't think the Cincinnati one has a person's name in it. But

302
00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:09.290
> P15:: I definitely kind of associate the Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the location like Pennsylvania.

303
00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:17.100
Tyler: Right? That makes sense. So even if yours has a name like that's not really what's top of mind. It's Cincinnati. Va.

304
00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:20.339
Tyler: yeah, for me. Yes, yeah, cool.

305
00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:25.949
Tyler: Alright. Well, let's pretend like your facility is called James J. Peters. Can you show me what you would do here?

306
00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:30.959
> P15:: I would click on James J. Peters and see what happened.

307
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:34.840
Tyler: Okay, cool. So what are we seeing now that you clicked on that?

308
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:36.660
> P15:: It

309
00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:44.330
> P15:: had like a circle with the selection I picked highlighted. So it kind of can makes me

310
00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:50.170
> P15:: confirm to me that that is the right location that I wanted, and I can proceed from there.

311
00:33:50.670 --> 00:34:03.990
Tyler: Okay, cool. Well, let's let's click continue. We'll pretend like that's the right one that you that you wanted to choose. And at this point in the form. can you tell me how well, how much longer. You feel like this is gonna be

312
00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.929
> P15:: I would say. Not too much longer. But it

313
00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:14.269
> P15:: does seem kind of like the information is kind of dragging out more, more. So

314
00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:21.260
> P15:: what? I was expecting to have to enter in everything. So probably I guess another 5 min.

315
00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:27.640
Tyler: Yeah. Okay. So again, your expectations have shifted because you're realizing this is longer than you would have guessed.

316
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:38.099
Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. And here it's it's asking for your phone number. And your email address. Is there anything else you think the Va needs to ask you about

317
00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.629
Tyler: before you can be done?

318
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:47.130
> P15::  they already have my name, social

319
00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:49.549
> P15:: address, phone number email.

320
00:34:50.540 --> 00:34:55.370
> P15:: Ii can't think of anything else.

321
00:34:56.370 --> 00:35:02.170
Tyler: Okay, cool. And looking at this screen here, does this look pretty straightforward? What it's asking for?

322
00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:09.539
Tyler: Yes, very straightforward. Okay, let's go ahead and click, continue. Then we'll pretend, like we put in your phone number and email.

323
00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:13.310
Tyler: okay.

324
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:18.420
Tyler: So without clicking anything yet, can you tell me which option you would choose? Here?

325
00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:23.500
> P15:: I'd probably say, phone.

326
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:31.229
Tyler: yeah, is that usually your preference? Yeah, yeah, we talked about that a little bit at the beginning.

327
00:35:31.410 --> 00:35:32.430
Tyler: And

328
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:37.260
Tyler: would you want to to choose more than one option, or just one

329
00:35:38.590 --> 00:36:00.849
> P15:: if I could choose more than one, I'd probably choose email as well, just to kind of have like a safety net. So make sure I would be contacted or receive the information one way or the other. Okay, so if you chose phone and email, then maybe you're thinking, like, okay, if I missed their phone call, then hopefully, they would just email, me

330
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.830
Tyler: is that sort of how you're thinking about?

331
00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:04.360
Tyler: That's not good plan.

332
00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:06.659
> P15:: Yeah, that's exactly how.

333
00:36:06.850 --> 00:36:07.710
Tyler: Okay.

334
00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:26.210
Tyler: cool. Well, it looks like we can only choose one option here, and I know that that would probably be phone for you. But we're actually gonna do something different today. We're gonna pretend like you would prefer us mail. I know that's not your preference. But this is mostly so we can test the website. So we'll click on us mail.

335
00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:29.530
Tyler: and then we'll click, continue.

336
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:36.310
Tyler: Now, what are we seeing next?

337
00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:42.170
> P15:: It's saying, country where you received mail.

338
00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:57.800
> P15:: So I guess if you are currently serving in the military and maybe stationed or deployed outside of the United States, you might have a different address situation that the Va. Needs to be aware of.

339
00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:05.040
> P15:: or if you are veteran. And you live outside of the United States. you'll have a different

340
00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:10.020
> P15:: address situation, that may be more complicated to get you your mail

341
00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:23.120
Tyler: okay. so do you feel like the focus of this page is on veterans who might not might have this more complicated address situation yes. Okay.

342
00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.440
Tyler: and on this page, what would you do?

343
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:42.840
> P15::  I click on the country and I click on United States. Since I live in the United States currently.

344
00:37:42.940 --> 00:37:48.360
Tyler: do you feel like There's anything about this page that you would change.

345
00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:52.360
> P15:: It kind of

346
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:56.379
> P15:: the way it it kind of like

347
00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:01.200
> P15:: seems different that they're

348
00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:10.059
> P15:: instead of simply asking like, Where do you live, or what country do you live in? I'd probably start with that first, because it's a pretty

349
00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.960
> P15:: standard question, and

350
00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:21.030
> P15:: maybe I'm assuming that the majority of people who are gonna be living in the United States. So it'll be a simple, clear type

351
00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:26.779
> P15:: answer. But for the small percentage who may live abroad.

352
00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:36.429
> P15:: Then it can kinda ask the more detailed question, like, what country do you live on? I live outside the United States. What country do you live in and go from there?

353
00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:47.969
Tyler: Yeah, okay, that's really helpful. So it feels like it's maybe it's not made for the majority right now, which are probably the majority of veterans, live in the Us.

354
00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:55.219
Tyler: And it feels like you could first just check if you live in the us. And then if you don't live in the Us, you could ask more details.

355
00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:01.390
> P15:: Yeah, it seems like it's a little bit, maybe too complicated. When it could be very simple.

356
00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.760
Tyler: I can totally see that

357
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:12.010
Tyler: that's really helpful. Okay, well, we chose United States. So we're ready to click, continue  and then

358
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:25.809
Tyler: what is this page? Oh, sorry I got confused with the pages. Is there anything that stands out to you on this page, or does this look how it normally looks when someone asks for your address.

359
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:28.319
> P15:: It looks

360
00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:34.069
> P15:: how it normally looks. When I'm asked for my address I'd say

361
00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:39.109
Tyler: so. Let's pretend like we put your address in here, and then we'll click, continue.

362
00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:43.100
Tyler: And now, what's this page asking for?

363
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:48.929
> P15:: I guess. Based on your address?

364
00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:53.149
> P15:: I guess the way the postal system works sometimes.

365
00:39:53.970 --> 00:39:58.850
> P15:: They need. They'll have a suggested address that you should use to help

366
00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.629
> P15:: get your mail delivered.

367
00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:04.920
> P15:: As opposed to what

368
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:15.179
> P15:: the other address was to ensure that you get your mail. So it's asking you to kinda confirm your address and select the better option to ensure you get the mail

369
00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:22.629
Tyler: right? Okay? So they wanna make sure that you're you're receiving the mail, and they wanna give you the best possible chance at that.

370
00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.149
Tyler: Have you seen something like this before?

371
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:31.320
Tyler: Okay, do you usually choose your what you entered or the suggestion?

372
00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.479
> P15:: I'd say just the suggested. To make sure I get

373
00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:38.759
> P15:: the mail or whatever I'm ordering

374
00:40:39.010 --> 00:40:45.469
Tyler: cool. Okay? So it looks like suggested is already clicked. So we can just go ahead and click. Continue here.

375
00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:51.239
Tyler: Alright. Can you describe this page to me?

376
00:40:52.220 --> 00:41:01.279
> P15:: It's the 4 or 4 categories it's asking to kind of review all your personal information that you entered.

377
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.619
> P15:: It looks like

378
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:11.120
> P15:: if you click on the pluses, it'll expand your previous categories and questions that you answered

379
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:16.789
> P15:: to kind of review them, to make sure that they are the proper answers.

380
00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.390
> P15:: And then there's some edit buttons

381
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:20.679
> P15:: that's unique.

382
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:26.090
> P15:: If you feel like you need to edit your information before you submit it.

383
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:50.549
Tyler: Awesome. That was a really helpful description. So we're seeing that this is like a place for you to check your answers. You showed me how to to open and close these so that felt pretty straightforward. And then you also notice that there's an edit button, so you can sometimes edit something. So what if let's just, you know, think of an example. What if you wanted to edit your phone number? Let's say that you realize you put it in incorrectly.

384
00:41:50.570 --> 00:42:02.079
Tyler: You show me how that would, how you would do that, and then you'll have to find your phone number first. I'd look for my phone number, probably like the personal information section.

385
00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:12.810
> P15::  so I'm seeing like my contact information down there, and it looks like press edit. And then I could go ahead and

386
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:16.349
> P15:: change my number if I entered it wrong, and then just press.

387
00:42:17.650 --> 00:42:31.899
Tyler: Yeah, that was helpful to watch you do that. So it felt pretty quick. You you assumed it would be in personal information. Then you found contact information. You clicked edit. Now, we can't actually type in this today. But we'll pretend like you typed a different phone number, maybe

388
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.860
Tyler: and it also looks like you can edit your email. Can you edit how how you're contacted?

389
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.600
Tyler: So we chose us mail. Can you change that?

390
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:43.590
> P15:: And

391
00:42:45.830 --> 00:42:49.629
> P15:: let me see here the mailing address?

392
00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:58.410
> P15:: I'm not. It's I'm not being able to open edit there. So I'm not sure if that's

393
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:09.590
Tyler: yeah. Sorry. That's just the prototype. So since I can't see your mouse, it's since it's your finger. So you're trying to click on edit next mailing address.

394
00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:15.810
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So that might be where you would think to change your contact preference.

395
00:43:17.090 --> 00:43:21.100
> P15:: Well, let me think. Contact preference.

396
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:31.429
> P15:: Yeah. Oh, I guess I would be back in contact information, because I see it says, how shall we contact you? That?

397
00:43:31.610 --> 00:43:32.640
> P15:: And okay.

398
00:43:33.810 --> 00:43:38.679
> P15:: And then I can update from there. If I want US. Mail, or

399
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:44.179
> P15:: I'm assuming you could probably change it to email or

400
00:43:45.570 --> 00:44:02.049
Tyler: awesome thanks for thanks for describing that to me, and sorry. I know that the prototype doesn't let you click on everything. So thanks for bearing with me. Alright. Well, let's let's pretend like we reviewed everything. We are ready to submit our question, and

401
00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.430
Tyler: you can go ahead and continue.

402
00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:11.989
> P15:: Would that be

403
00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:27.549
Tyler: alright? So I saw we had a little look around for the button, and then we we clicked on. Submit question.

404
00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:36.370
Tyler: Now, we're on this page. I'm gonna give you a couple of minutes to just read this page, and then I'd love for you to summarize to me what you're learning here.

405
00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:37.920
> P15:: Okay.

406
00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:58.600
> P15:: it's it looks like after you submit your question.

407
00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.940
> P15:: The Va. Just kind of confirms with you that

408
00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:10.350
> P15:: that your question was submitted successfully. So they have that in green which is reassuring to me

409
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:14.700
> P15:: that I know my question sic successfully went through.

410
00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:20.320
> P15:: and then they do a good job. Giving you like a reference number. So that

411
00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:24.680
> P15:: looks official to me that my question is submitted, and

412
00:45:24.990 --> 00:45:30.760
> P15:: I have a number that I can reference in case I need to go back and communicate with the Va.

413
00:45:30.970 --> 00:45:46.459
> P15:: As to the progress of my question. I have a number I can easily pull up. It's reassuring to me that they sent a confirmation email as well. So I can have that my records in my inbox.

414
00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:56.230
> P15:: They're saying that someone should they'll mail out a response to my question within 7 business days.

415
00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:02.159
> P15:: and they're reassuring me like, if they need any more information that will go ahead and contact me

416
00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:15.460
> P15:: and at the bottom, there's the the need help again. That's been pretty throughout the whole process, with the number and the hours, and what not to call if you're having issues

417
00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:28.140
Tyler: awesome. That was a really helpful summary. So it sounds like there's a lot of information in there. Is there anything that you would like to know after you submit your question that you haven't learned from this page.

418
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.940
Tyler: Is there anything missing?

419
00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:41.129
> P15::  No, II

420
00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:48.849
> P15:: and kind of assuming, you know, it's gonna take some time with the Va. For them to go through my request and question.

421
00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:54.620
> P15:: and I'm just happy to know that it was submitted. I have a reference number, and that

422
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:58.620
> P15:: I'll get some kind of reply within 7 business days.

423
00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:02.209
> P15:: Other than that, I can't really think of

424
00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:05.990
> P15:: what else I could ask for.

425
00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:13.629
Tyler: Yeah, cool. Well, it's not a trick question that sounds like you got a lot of the things that you'd need from this.

426
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:24.690
Tyler: this has been super helpful to look through the prototype. You've actually reached the end of the prototype. So you're welcome to stop sharing your screen if you like, and we can just chat for the last couple of minutes.

427
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:26.280
Tyler: I think

428
00:47:26.330 --> 00:47:28.949
Tyler: if you click back to zoom.

429
00:47:30.850 --> 00:47:31.900
Tyler: it might.

430
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:37.979
Tyler: Yeah, if you go back to that, yeah, perfect. It'll have that red button perfect.

431
00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:54.009
Tyler: Alright! Alrighty So we just finished with the prototype. We went through a lot of different screens, and that was super helpful for me to see how you clicked through them and what you were thinking about. What do you think of that process overall?

432
00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:58.379
> P15:: I thought it was a pretty smooth process.

433
00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:06.070
> P15:: I've dealt a little bit with, like the Va online and the screens all kind of looked familiar and

434
00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:14.529
> P15:: the questions were pretty simple to answer, so appreciated that. And it seems pretty straightforward process.

435
00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:20.520
Tyler: Yeah, that that's helpful. What do you think that you would want to change

436
00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:22.949
Tyler: so anything that could be easier.

437
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:29.510
> P15::  I guess Jess

438
00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:37.509
> P15:: maybe be a little bit more straightforward as to far as the length of the

439
00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:45.620
> P15:: like, the time cause I was seeing like what steps one through 4. And at first they were starting out pretty basic questions.

440
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:53.630
> P15:: And then it just kinda kept going and going. And maybe that that might be off putting to some people, and they might just

441
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:57.319
> P15:: say, I give up, or I don't know this information.

442
00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:00.579
> P15:: but other than that

443
00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.439
> P15:: can't really think of anything.

444
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:05.719
Tyler: Yeah, well, that's a really helpful one to note. So

445
00:49:05.790 --> 00:49:28.019
Tyler: the throughout. When I asked you, how much longer do you think this is gonna be your expectation shifted? As you use the form. And so I think we could see that that progress bar that was trying to give you an idea of where you were wasn't really giving you enough of an idea of where you were. So there's a little bit of guessing involved in in terms of how long it would take.

446
00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:41.639
Tyler: And I think, compared to the first, the first time you said it was maybe gonna take about 30 s. And I know we're in a research environment. So we're talking a lot, too. But I think that probably was a little longer than you thought it was gonna be even so.

447
00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:47.070
Tyler:  very much. Yeah, awesome.

448
00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:49.900
Tyler: Is there anything else you want to share about what we looked at today?

449
00:49:51.700 --> 00:50:05.530
Tyler: I can't really think of anything else I could say about it. Yeah, that's okay. I know it's like a long time to to talk about one little website. Do you have any other questions for me? It could be about this research that we're doing, or anything?

450
00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:10.790
> P15:: No, no real questions for me.

451
00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:16.419
Tyler: Cool. Well, thanks so much, [P15]. We've reached the end of our our session and our time.

452
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:28.459
Tyler: perigee. And they're the folks who set up this research session. They're gonna send you a thank you. Note. It should be familiar. Since you've taken part in research before and if you have any questions you can follow up with them.

453
00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:33.550
Tyler: But I think that's it. I really appreciate your time. It was so helpful to get your feedback.

454
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:43.110
> P15:: Okay, well, thank you very much for having me, Tyler, and I look forward to working with you again down the road. Yeah, I hope to see you again in research.

455
00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:48.300
Tyler: Alright. Well, thanks, [P15], have a good day, too. Bye.
