Research study: [Submit an inquiry (Round 1)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ask-va/research/Submit%20an%20inquiry/Round%201)

## Transcript

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:07.129

Tyler: Alright. So are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio today? Yes.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:22.050

Tyler: Okay, thank you. So we've got through the beginning bit but before we get into the bulk of the research session, I just want to take a chance to get to know you and your experience with the VA a little bit better. How long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.460

> P1: Well, I was and listed in 74.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:40.220

Tyler: Okay, so a couple of years now. And have you been interacting with the VA since you became a Veteran, or just in the last couple of years?

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:58.420

> P1: Well, in the last several years in regard to medical care. And before that before that, and when I got discharged early, not early, but earlier in life I went to college with VA. Under the Gi bill.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:06.079

Tyler: Gotcha. Okay? So you have probably a long standing familiarity with some of the VA services. That's helpful.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.490

Tyler: Have you ever contacted the VA? Maybe online or over the phone?

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:37.769

> P1: Well, I contact them. I contact them online. The only one I talk to on the phone sometimes, like, is my doctor or nurse practitioner. But I contact them online with telehealth sometimes ordering prescriptions and everything mostly nowadays, it's just centered around healthcare.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:53.960

Tyler: That makes sense.

> P1: I don't have any more benefits than that. So yeah.

Tyler: Okay, so a lot of your interaction is about healthcare. And sometimes you're calling your doctor directly, or you're doing things like ordering prescriptions. That makes sense.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.660

Tyler: Alright. Well, we're gonna move on. And I'm gonna start by sharing a prototype with you. So I mentioned, this is not gonna work perfectly, but it's gonna do the job for today. And this is all about getting your feedback. So we want to understand how things are working. If things are confusing, if things are helpful and I'm gonna walk you through it and kind of guide you when we want to go to the next page and things like that.

Tyler: So I think you've done this before, because I'm pretty sure that we've met! So I'm gonna send a link in the chat. In the zoom chat, and I just sent you a link to a prototype. So it's a pretty long link, and it starts with www.figma.

Tyler: And if you just open that on your computer. Let me know when you've got it open.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.709

> P1: I have it. It's fully opening now.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:05.819

Tyler: Okay, great. So it's loading. So now we're gonna share your screen on Zoom. Have you done that before? I'm gonna give you a second to do that.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.260

> P1: Okay, and you want this prototype?

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:18.420

Tyler: Yes, please. Yeah, if you can just share that prototype. And I'll let you know when I'm seeing it. Perfect.

Tyler: Okay, great. So now I can see what you're seeing as well. It looks like it's a VA website.

Tyler: So we aren't gonna click on anything yet. I'm just gonna give you a moment to look at this page, and then I'd love for you to tell me what you're first noticing on this page. What's jumping out at you?

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:47.749

> P1: What's jumping out at me is Ask the VA. So if you have questions, you can, you know, pose your questions to the VA. I mean that's the most prominent thing right there. And after you have all the peripheral, the usual peripheral stuff on the VA website. Benefits and healthcare, you know, VA, locations, all that stuff is. 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.749

> P1: Should I scroll down?

Tyler: Yeah, you're welcome to.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.600

> P1: Okay, so all this is based on making an inquiry with the VA, asking questions then, so questions about benefits and services and documents. Okay.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:42.249

Tyler: Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. I love how you described everything out loud to me. So it sounds like it's a familiar website, you can tell, you're on a VA website. And this is about asking a question or in making an inquiry to the VA.

Tyler: Great. So for the rest of our conversation today, I'm gonna have us pretend that you need to ask the VA a question. So we're gonna say that you've recently noticed some problems with your hearing. And you wanna ask the VA how you get your hearing checked by an audiologist. So without clicking anything yet, can you tell me what you would do first if you had that question?

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.350

> P1:  Well, if I had that question, I would... let me scroll down. Maybe there's a place for questions about... see it says, sign in for the best experience, so I would have to sign into an account or create an account like I see in this green box. But I have an account with the VA. So I would have to sign in.

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:40.139

Tyler: Okay, so it sounds like, in order to ask a question about getting your hearing checked. Do you need to sign in?

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:46.769

> P1: Yeah.

Tyler: That's helpful. And it sounds like, you've got an account setup. So you would naturally just go and sign in.

> P1: Yeah.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.069

Tyler: Okay, that's helpful. And what are the benefits of signing in?

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:04.659

> P1: Well, if you sign in, this is just from my mind, not working from the prototype. When you sign in, you have access to all of the little, you know, drop-downs, whatever, all of these areas, you know. Again, mine is mostly on medical stuff. So you'll have pharmacy, you'll have, you know, email to the physician, team, and all of these drop-downs that you can choose from. Other stuff is on it, too. But I don't mostly use it. 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:37.659

Tyler: Okay, that makes sense. So when you think about the benefits of signing in, you're relying on your past memory of using other VA services. And it seems to have some things like almost tailored to you if you've signed in?

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.240

> P1: Yeah.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:46.880

Tyler: And looking at this page, how long do you think it's gonna take for you to ask the VA your question?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:07:01.289

> P1: You should be able to ask the question right away. That's what I assume. After you sign in, and then just type the question in, or if it's on a dropdown, I don't know.

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:07.730

Tyler: Do you think that you're gonna have to give the VA more information, or is it just going to be your question? What's your guess?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.939

> P1: Well, the sign is, gonna come with just your username and password. Or if you have to create an account. I can't recall creating an account cause I've had mine for several years, but maybe you'd have to put in things like addresses and phone numbers and stuff like that. Sure.

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:35.029

Tyler: That's super helpful. So for today, what we're going to do is we're going to scroll down a little bit. And we're gonna imagine that we're asking a question without signing in. Is there a way to do that?

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:43.520

> P1: Let's see. I don't see where there's a way to do that unless you went to this. No, because it's already highlighted. So Ask VA would give you what's here. So I don't see a way to ask without signing in.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.739

Tyler: Yeah, that makes sense. So you understood it says you can sign in after you ask a question...

> P1: But your question will be tied to your account. Where would the answer go? It would just go in the ethos, I guess.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:32.099

Tyler: Okay. So first off, it's not clear how to continue if you haven't signed in, but it does say that you can do that, but then it's a little confusing where your question will go...

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:40.399

> P1: Where the response would go, I don't know. Wait a minute. There's a continue without signing in. I just see on the bottom.

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.450

Tyler: Okay? So that took... that was a little bit hidden, would you say?

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.699

> P1: I don't know. My eyes just didn't go to it. you know. I don't know why.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:09:05.919

Tyler: Yeah, I think that's fair. It seemed really easy for you to see that you need to sign in and a little bit harder to see that you could continue without signing in, which is really helpful feedback. So let's go ahead and click on. Continue without signing in.

73
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:20.249
Tyler: Okay. So I mentioned earlier that we're pretending, like you need to ask the Via question about getting your hearing checked. So with that in mind, can you show me what you would do on this page

74
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.130
P1: what I would do on this page. Let me make sure I got the whole page.

75
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:32.390
P1: Okay. So it says, I would go to this, where it says, Select the category that best described the question, and I would switch in the dropdown.

76
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.670
Tyler: Okay, perfect. Let's go ahead and open the dropdown.

77
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.759
P1: Okay? So hearing would be in the area of healthcare.

78
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.849
Tyler: Okay, let's go ahead. Yeah, we can go ahead and click on health care.

79
00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:57.890
Tyler: And then let's just talk about this for a minute before we click anything. So that felt really quick for you to choose healthcare. Did that feel like an easy choice?

80
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.720
Tyler: Okay.

81
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:06.150
Tyler: and how important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?

82
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:16.059
P1:  I think it's very important. If it's about health care, I mean, hopefully would be specific.

83
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:18.929
P1: Yeah, not some, generalized.

84
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:23.840
P1: I don't know, Miss Mash. Answer.

85
00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.160
Tyler: So you feel like you're gonna get a better answer because you chose the right category.

86
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.510
P1: I think so, unless they have something in their system that would.

87
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:48.310
Tyler: if they are use of AI which would send their question to the right area. I don't know.

88
00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:56.520
Tyler: Okay, so and when you said, Send your right? Yeah, it seems like they can do just about anything now.

89
00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:02.079
Tyler: And when you said, they can send your question to the right area. Can you tell me what that means?

90
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:03.850
P1: Say that again

91
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:11.610
Tyler: you mentioned like, or they could use AI if and that could send your question to the right area, what do you mean by sending it to the right area?

92
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.910
P1: Okay? So if if if your question.

93
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:19.130
P1:  is financial in nature.

94
00:11:19.710 --> 00:11:21.730
P1: The program would send that to

95
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:28.219
P1: a section that deals with finances. Okay, if it's about debt, or if it's about health, or if it's about

96
00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.180
P1: whatever it could be about

97
00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.979
P1: records stuff like that like, if you typed in.

98
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:41.210
P1: I need a replacement for my DD 2 14 that would trigger them to send that to a records.

99
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:52.819
P1: Got it? Yeah, that's really, really helpful. So it feels like you have to answer this question. Well, because it's important that your question goes to the right place.

100
00:11:53.640 --> 00:12:01.319
Tyler: Okay, that's really helpful. Okay, we're gonna go ahead and move on so we can click on let's go to the next page.

101
00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:03.030
P1: continue

102
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:06.760
Tyler:  perfect.

103
00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:13.579
Tyler: Okay, so i'll give you a second to look at this page, and then I'd love for you to just show me what you would choose on this page.

104
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.280
P1: Okay, I would choose what they have at the top audiology and hearing aids

105
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.930
Tyler: awesome. You can go ahead and click on that one.

106
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:35.240
Tyler: And then, while we're here, I know our question today is about hearing. But I'd love for you to just look over this list. Is there anything that's jumping out at you that you don't understand?

107
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.550
Tyler: It's not clear.

108
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:52.670
P1:  

109
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.109
P1: I nothing. I don't understand.

110
00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:04.239
Tyler: Okay, so probably from your experience with interacting with the Va before some of these things sound familiar.

111
00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.890
P1: Yeah, some of them. I use them caregiver support program.

112
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:12.720
P1: I when I first

113
00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:18.349
P1: signed up for health care, eligibility, and how to apply was important.

114
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:28.469
Tyler: Yeah, awesome. And the last question we answered, you chose health care, and what's the difference between that question and the one you're answering right now on this page?

115
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:43.410
P1:  it's more specific in the area of healthcare. So in this case, hearing deficiency, or something like that.

116
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:50.699
Tyler: And what if you came to this page and you couldn't find an option that fits your needs? What would you do.

117
00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:54.370
P1: What would I do? Probably choose an option that comes

118
00:13:54.470 --> 00:14:06.289
Tyler: close enough to my needs. So I could get to some place where I could. Input, the question, Gotcha, yeah. So you wouldn't like let it stop you. You would try and continue and choose something like close.

119
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:12.680
P1: just like, just like when you're call these customer support. You gotta

120
00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:24.570
Tyler: to something. So you can get a voice totally. Yeah, that makes sense. I think I just have one more question on this page. So up here it says, your category and topic.

121
00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:29.260
Tyler: What is that? What is that gray box describing?

122
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.330
P1: It's describing the 2?

123
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:48.020
Tyler: Well, the first choice that you made, which was the category in the second choice that you're making the topic which is the Audi Audiology. So it's just describing your choices so far. Gotcha. Okay, do you know why that might be there, or why that might be useful?

124
00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:56.380
P1:  

125
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:04.320
P1: Oh. I only I want to say that at this stage of

126
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.450
P1: navigating the website

127
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:19.489
P1: it doesn't seem to have much use, because there's only one thing in the box which is health care. But if you had to click, click, click, click, and it's gonna give you a list of everything every section that you've been to. Then.

128
00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:24.859
P1: you know. See, you know how you're navigating the site to get where you need to go.

129
00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:33.259
Tyler: Okay, Gotcha. So it's almost like you're thinking about it like a map of where you've been right now, you haven't been very far. So you don't really need your map.

130
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:41.739
P1: Gotcha, that's super interesting. Okay, we're gonna go ahead and click to the next screen. So you can go ahead and choose, continue.

131
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:51.760
Tyler: And just to remind you, we're asking a question about how you get your hearing checked. So can you show me what you would do on this page?

132
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.649
P1: Okay, this page.

133
00:15:58.110 --> 00:16:02.950
P1: What's your question about? So it's not about someone else's Va benefit?

134
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.890
P1:  it's a general question.

135
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:15.440
Tyler: it's a general question and why, why do you think it's a general question, can you tell that can you describe that to me, because the other options

136
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:28.609
P1: this, someone else's Va. Benefits that might be eligibility or something like this, and my own Va. Benefits again, might apply to eligibility, or, you know, access like that. So maybe I won't.

137
00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:34.880
P1: Might not want to be specific about that, because that's not about my hearing problem. So it's a general question.

138
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.860
P1: So I might click that

139
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:44.680
P1: and hopefully it would stay. I don't see that box that was on the other page with the topic category and then question.

140
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.670
Tyler: you know, Umhm.

141
00:16:46.760 --> 00:17:05.080
Tyler: right? Okay. So couple of things that you're noticing. One is that that box is gone, and then another one is that you're telling me, you're not really associating your hearing question with your own va benefits, it sounds more like a general question, so you would choose that

142
00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:12.080
Tyler: that makes sense. And what about what if you were gonna choose someone else's va benefits, can you imagine a scenario where you would choose that.

143
00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:19.480
P1: Yeah. Cause I'm a caretaker for another veteran. So if I had an issue like

144
00:17:20.339 --> 00:17:26.970
P1: packed act that just came out for people who were exposed to burn pits and other things. Okay,

145
00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:36.149
P1: I might want to go to someone else's Va benefit to see if he has a benefit regarding this latest changes and benefit structure.

146
00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:49.079
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay, cool, so that one feels clear. It's like, if, if, as a caretaker, this is the one you would choose if you had a question about somebody else. Great! That's that's really helpful to hear how you describe each of these options.

147
00:17:49.330 --> 00:18:00.539
Tyler:  so what we're gonna do is, we're gonna click on my own benefits today, which I know is not the option that felt most intuitive to you. So you'll have to just bear with me.

148
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:06.050
Tyler: and before we click on, continue how much longer do you think this form is going to be

149
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:15.569
P1: okay? So my own benefits? A something tells me I'm going to be at least 2 more clicks before the question.

150
00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.830
Tyler: Okay, what's telling you that?

151
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:35.500
P1: My experience of having to click? Thanks. So it just feels like my own benefits, my own benefits. The next thing might be which benefit in particular health care. Education. Da da. Da. Okay.

152
00:18:35.530 --> 00:18:39.690
P1: Next page. Okay, now, what is the health problem, is it?

153
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.399
P1: They might ask me. Pulmonary audiology, vision, you know. Pharmacy.

154
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.319
P1: Click. Now ask your question.

155
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:59.859
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay? Cool. So you feel like it's gonna keep asking more questions about your benefits and your healthcare and and trying to get more and more specific. And then you can ask your question. Okay, cool.

156
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:02.299
Tyler: Let's click, continue, and we'll see what happens.

157
00:19:08.770 --> 00:19:13.810
Tyler: Alright. So can you tell me what you would do on this page?

158
00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.269
P1: Reason I have a question.

159
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:27.849
P1: and you're and you're laughing here. Can you describe to me what you might find a little bit funny about this?

160
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.369
P1: You, you and I are talking. I anticipate

161
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:46.400
P1: I have a couple of more clicks. So here's click number one, right? Okay, so you're kind of like, oh, of course, there's another question cause. That's kind of what I thought would happen.

162
00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.520
Tyler: Question

163
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:50.550
P1: alright.

164
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:53.439
P1: You know, I mean these other things.

165
00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:58.879
P1: Maybe people. They click these other things. I'm not. I'm not a particular commenter about

166
00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.859
P1: customer service and that kind of stuff. I don't do that. Usually we present moments all in there complaining, but you know.

167
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:17.920
Tyler: I just would click. I have a question, yeah, okay, so it feels really straightforward to answer this, and almost sounds like every time you go through the form. That's probably what you would be using it for.

168
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:31.119
Tyler: Because you're not someone who would probably reach out to complain or I'm not. It's just me. I don't do that. I'm not a review person either. If I go to a hotel, I'm not gonna review the hotel

169
00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:41.720
Tyler: and leave, you know. Yeah, that makes sense. Why do you think the Va. Is asking this question?

170
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:46.449
P1: Does people have concerns? You know

171
00:20:46.600 --> 00:21:09.140
P1: most people are not like me. I'm just a stale old, you know, Zoom, but some people actually have concerns about things. Maybe they had a nurse like this when I wanna say something nice. Maybe the the volunteer who pushed them in the wheelchair was made the whole day, you know. Wanna say that, you know just II I'm all for it, you know, but I just kinda

172
00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:24.870
Tyler: you know, my brain is not wired like that. Yeah, I think that's perfectly fine. And do you feel like this question needs to be here so that people know that they can say something nice or like, if this question wasn't here, could someone still say something nice?

173
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.130
P1:  hmm!

174
00:21:30.170 --> 00:21:40.420
P1: Probably. Well. we do. What did we click before? See if we had that box? I knew what we clicked before. Do we click the 8 benefits of something?

175
00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:55.159
Tyler: Yeah, that's a good question. So it's you're feeling like a little bit lost from what's happened, which might also be a subject of us talking a lot which is fair. But yeah, the last page said, what's your question about? And then we chose my own Va benefits.

176
00:21:55.770 --> 00:22:02.110
P1: Okay? So my old Va Va benefits. A lot of this stuff doesn't have anything to do with that

177
00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.890
Tyler:  you know these choices

178
00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.620
P1: select the reap.

179
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:14.409
P1: I, okay, so I, my own, va benefits. Select the reason why you're contacting us today. Okay,

180
00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:19.879
P1: and what say? Something nice has nothing to do with the benefit.

181
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.490
Tyler: I have a complaint about service. Maybe

182
00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:27.650
P1: I have a suggestion. Okay, I attended at all all. And now I have a question

183
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.999
P1: I don't know. I don't see what those come into benefits. But

184
00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:34.350
Tyler: that's helpful.

185
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:40.460
Tyler: It feels a little bit disconnected from what the question you just answered, yeah, I can totally see that

186
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:44.730
Tyler: let's go ahead and move on. So let's click. I have a question.

187
00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.320
Tyler: and then we'll continue.

188
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:58.120
Tyler: Okay, we've arrived. Yeah. Tell me about that. Did it feel like it took us a long time to get here? Or

189
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:59.969
Tyler: how does this feel?

190
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:09.270
P1:  for me?

191
00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:24.430
P1: If I weren't communicating with you back and forth I would have just been click, click, click, click, click, click, click, so it wouldn't have seemed like a long time, because all that other stuff I would've just zipping board all of it where I can answer the end to the question.

192
00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:32.040
Tyler: yeah, that's the focal point for you is like, I'm here to ask a question. I want to type in my question. Let me just click through until I can do that.

193
00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.770
P1: That that that's that's a a and that

194
00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:41.589
P1: I hope it helps. But some people are poor. Why, I'd like me. That's how they'll do for sure. Yeah, no, it's super helpful.

195
00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:52.350
Tyler: I think that makes complete sense. And then, just looking at this page, we're not actually gonna type anything in today. But does it feel straightforward? What you would do? Could you describe to me what you would do.

196
00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:53.910
P1: Oh.

197
00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:59.489
P1: it's straightforward for a person who's familiar with this

198
00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.560
P1: particular type of page. But if the person

199
00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:04.090
P1: wasn't.

200
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:10.930
P1: it might stay instead of what's your question? Maybe enter your question in the box something like this, so they could be

201
00:24:12.030 --> 00:24:16.330
P1: directed. I know that it's saying, you know

202
00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:22.259
P1: what's your question. So I would type my question in that box. Right? Yeah, that's a really good idea.

203
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:31.280
Tyler: And let's say we typed in your question. So we said, you know, I think I might be having problems with my hearing. I don't know how to get my hearing checked. Help me. And

204
00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.440
Tyler: and then we were gonna click, continue, how much longer do you think the form is going to be?

205
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:44.760
P1: Okay? So if I click continue, it's gonna say. we've received your question. and. let's see, would say.

206
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:48.389
P1: would it direct my question to the proper place

207
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:51.779
P1: if it says, you know.

208
00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.010
if for somehow they knew, because

209
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.470
P1: to me we went off track. From the last page.

210
00:24:58.670 --> 00:25:01.200
P1: From healthcare we went to

211
00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.510
P1: just general

212
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:18.160
P1: customer service stuff, but if it got back to healthcare it would say, maybe that your question has been forwarded to the Ola Audiology department and expect the response within 7 days.

213
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:37.510
Tyler: Gotcha, okay, that's really useful. So we kind of went off track with the beginning, was making sense. It was like healthcare audiology. And then it went into customer service questions. But you think that after you enter your question. You're gonna get some sort of confirmation of where your question is being sent, and that it's it's done right.

214
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:47.199
Tyler: And your response time awesome. That's really useful. So we'll pretend like we typed in your question. Like I said, it's a prototype. So we can't type in this today, and we'll click continue

215
00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.509
Tyler: and alright. So can you show me what you would do on this page?

216
00:25:53.930 --> 00:26:02.449
P1: Okay, I would be the better. Yeah, give them shipped to the veteran. So

217
00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:10.519
Tyler: right, that makes sense. Do you feel like there's ever a time when you would choose? I'm a family member of a veteran

218
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:20.039
P1:  on any Va website? Yeah, on any Va website. Yeah, actually, I do. I cause I do.

219
00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:32.860
P1: I do a fiduciary audit for my friend who I'm a caretaker for. And I have to click this one. I'm a family member of veteran. Okay? So it feels familiar to you because you you have this experience as being a caretaker.

220
00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:37.000
Tyler: Great. Okay. is there anything else you notice on this page?

221
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:57.209
P1:  well, this is now we're gonna ask some personal information. So the next couple of pages might be more personal information numbers, and whatever.

222
00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.170
Tyler: okay.

223
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:09.289
Tyler: I see your little shrug. Let's go ahead and click. I'm the veteran, and then we'll continue.

224
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:20.660
P1: How would you answer this question? I would say, no. I'm not an employee.

225
00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:23.369
Tyler: Why do you think the Va. Is asking you this?

226
00:27:24.750 --> 00:27:26.629
P1: You know, I don't know.

227
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.300
Tyler: Yeah.

228
00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.210
Tyler: okay, well, let's click now

229
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:34.320
Tyler: and then we'll continue

230
00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:52.070
Tyler: perfect. So like I said, we're not actually gonna type anything in. But let's look at these questions, and I'd like to know if things stand out to you so you can go ahead and scroll, and then tell me if you're seeing anything that feels maybe different than you expect, or confusing

231
00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.880
P1:  different than what I expect is

232
00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:03.530
P1: your entire social security. Number number one has 4.

233
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:07.670
a

234
00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:15.899
P1: service number. I'd have to go and get that. you know. It's not something that's in my brain.

235
00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.180
P1: Bit of Berthas

236
00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:22.740
P1: straightforward. Then, of course, in

237
00:28:23.150 --> 00:28:26.540
P1: in the 2,000 s, you have to go through the pronoun stuff.

238
00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:32.570
Tyler:  so this is fallen into this

239
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:38.000
P1: inclusion, and all that I don't know what the terms.

240
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.560
P1: DEI,

241
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.950
P1: Umhm, yeah. Yeah.

242
00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:43.170
Tyler: Umhm.

243
00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:53.789
P1: that's new to me. I haven't seen that on the pages. Let's talk about a couple of things. Let's start with the social security number. If we scroll up a little bit.

244
00:28:53.890 --> 00:29:05.640
Tyler: So social security number, you were surprised that you're you're providing the whole number. Yeah, that makes sense. And then service number. You're like, Oh, I don't have that off the top of my head. I have to go find that.

245
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.629
P1: Does it feel like you need to give your social security number and your service number?

246
00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:20.660
P1: I don't know if they trying to use that as some type of security check, you know, I guess. But

247
00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:25.870
P1: service number is going to send somebody in a tizzy.

248
00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:27.079
P1: you know, like

249
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:40.710
P1: I gotta find the DD 2, 14, or I gotta find some document with a service number on it, though you know I've never used my service number. I don't think for anything I can't remember.

250
00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:45.590
Tyler: Okay. yeah. So

251
00:29:46.290 --> 00:30:00.410
Tyler: your service number is not top of mind. And it's also kind of surprising that it would be something that they're asking for in this form. Great, let's move on. So you talked about pronouns, one of the following.

252
00:30:01.030 --> 00:30:05.799
Tyler: So if you did the social security, you wouldn't have to do the service number. So

253
00:30:07.340 --> 00:30:10.480
P1: that's a reprieve, anyway. So that's good.

254
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:19.979
Tyler: Okay, that's good. So it's a reprieve. But also it wasn't obvious at first. So you might have maybe stress for a second about finding that one in bold as well.

255
00:30:20.010 --> 00:30:24.300
Tyler: Gotcha. Okay, cool. So it was a little bit easier to miss, which is

256
00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:41.140
Tyler: can be frustrating. Okay, let's scroll down to pronouns and gender. We're just gonna talk about this real quick. So you mentioned that this is like maybe part of a Dei initiative, and maybe also different to other forms you filled out with the Va. Is that right?

257
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:44.240
P1: I've never used. I've never seen this before this.

258
00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:57.109
Tyler: Yeah, so it's like you've never seen it before. It sounded like it might be straightforward for you to fill it out. Like you would kind of understand your options. But you're surprised that it's part of this form

259
00:30:59.060 --> 00:30:59.920
Tyler: that right?

260
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.519
P1: Not surprised. Okay.

261
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:10.380
P1: hello. Here we are, Gotcha. It's more of a like, oh, now we're doing this. Okay.

262
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:15.490
Tyler: got it cool.

263
00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:23.009
Tyler: So let's go ahead and scroll down. We're going to pretend like we filled in this page with all your information. And then we're going to click. Continue.

264
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:25.010
P1: Okay?

265
00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.580
Tyler: Alright. So can you describe this page to me?

266
00:31:32.290 --> 00:31:33.050
P1: Okay.

267
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:38.170
P1: U of a health facility. So this will just ask.

268
00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:57.150
Tyler: really the closest place to where you, where you go and get your services right.

269
00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:11.680
Tyler: If you know the name of the facility. And is there another way to search? It says, search by location. You just type in the town, or something which one do you think you would choose usually.

270
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:22.769
P1:  my mind go back to before I actually knew where I was going. Maybe location.

271
00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:25.449
P1: Yeah, search by location. Okay?

272
00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:41.039
Tyler: So if you didn't know which health facility you go to, you would choose location. But now, knowing your I think you, you know your health facility right? Because you're enrolled in healthcare. Okay? Got it. That's that's really interesting.

273
00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:51.040
Tyler: we can't actually type in this today. But what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like, your health facility. Starts with James. So I'm gonna have you just click inside that box where you would normally type.

274
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:58.939
Tyler: We'll just click one time and we'll pretend like you, you typed in James. Okay. now, what are we seeing?

275
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:02.750
P1: Okay, you're seeing a few choices

276
00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:11.700
Tyler: with which James is a part. Okay? And I'm going to say that your health facility is called James J. Peters. Can you show me what you would do next?

277
00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:16.410
P1: I would go down to this bottom one and click it.

278
00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.429
Tyler: Okay. And now, what are we seeing?

279
00:33:20.700 --> 00:33:25.320
P1: Okay? So you're seeing the facility that you with?

280
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:34.820
P1: Requested highlighted, sorry

281
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:36.120
P1: as a choice

282
00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:37.630
Tyler: that makes sense.

283
00:33:37.780 --> 00:34:00.109
Tyler: and without clicking anything, can you tell me like? Let's say you chose the wrong facility you were like? Oh, no, that's the old facility. I went to. What would you do on this page? Button? Okay, you'd hit the back button, and would that be the back button? Can you? Can you describe to me where that back button is on your page? Okay? Rather. The continue.

284
00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.680
Tyler: Okay. Got it?

285
00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:21.930
P1: Well, maybe it's possible that if you just hit the one that you need. You could just hit it, and it would just change that you if you discovered the one that you need on this list. Let's say it was the Haley veterans in Tampa. Say, oh, no, Tampa, I don't want New York boom, and you just click Tampa.

286
00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:24.000
Tyler: Let's go ahead and click, continue.

287
00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:33.020
Tyler: we're gonna go through this next these next few screens a little bit more quickly. Just because of the interest of time.

288
00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.929
Tyler:  so

289
00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:41.300
Tyler: looking at this page. Does anything stand out to you or or feel unfamiliar?

290
00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:42.710
P1: No.

291
00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.420
P1: vulnerable.

292
00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:50.709
Tyler: Okay. And if we just think about the process overall, how much longer. Do you think the form will be now?

293
00:34:53.219 --> 00:34:58.359
P1:  I think this is like the last page, because it says back to the top.

294
00:34:58.520 --> 00:35:02.929
Tyler: So maybe it's the last page asking for feedback like you, finished

295
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:07.190
Tyler: Umhm. Okay, it might be the last page.

296
00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:21.430
Tyler: let's go ahead and click congratulations. Congratulations. You made it. Page might be next, okay. So we're kind of hoping for the congratulations. Page next, we'll pretend like we typed in your phone number. And email, we'll click, continue.

297
00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:30.110
Tyler: And now we're seeing this page. So this is different than what we expected without clicking anything. Yet can you tell me which option you would normally choose.

298
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.290
P1: Okay.

299
00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:38.050
P1: I usually choose. If they allow phone and email, okay.

300
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.450
Tyler: why do you like to choose 2 options?

301
00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:56.079
P1: Because the email I may not get to right away. But it's it's there, you know, and it's it'll be there as if I have time to like. Get it today. Not look at it tomorrow, not time phone. If it's something critical.

302
00:35:56.110 --> 00:36:03.530
P1: you know they ask for the phone. And then is it the best time to call, you know? Boom, boom boom type. It makes total sense.

303
00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:18.079
Tyler: For today. Just in the interest of of testing this website, we're gonna choose us mail. So we're gonna pretend like you'd prefer the Va. Sent you mail to respond to your question, and we'll click. We'll click on. Continue.

304
00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.839
P1: Okay. Last

305
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:28.949
Tyler: alright. So on this page. Can you show me what you would do? Is that realistic that people gonna click that us mail?

306
00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:42.980
Tyler: Yeah. So it sounds like this. I mean, you laughed. I also laughed. It sounds like, maybe this is like, not an option you would normally choose but in theory this is an option that you could choose. Yeah.

307
00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:45.000
Tyler: cool.

308
00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:49.479
Tyler: alright. So on this page, I'm just gonna let you show me what you would do here.

309
00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:52.550
P1: Okay.

310
00:36:53.760 --> 00:37:00.120
P1: if this was relevant to me. I received mail outside the Us. On a military base.

311
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:07.099
P1: Okay, I don't know, or it, doesn't it? I would expect them to just say, Put your address in

312
00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:12.969
Tyler: right? So it's a little weird that it's asking for your country. First

313
00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:18.309
P1: Cause. That seems like to be secondary, that you outside of the Us.

314
00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:33.059
Tyler: Umhm, right? Okay, that's really useful. So it feels like it's focusing on like, are you outside the Us instead of first assuming you probably in the Us. Yeah, that that makes sense.

315
00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:39.069
Tyler: For today, we're gonna choose. We're gonna open that menu. And we're gonna choose United States.

316
00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.640
P1: Okay.

317
00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.520
P1: United States.

318
00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.370
Tyler: Okay, that's

319
00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:55.569
P1: that's weird. Okay, yeah. And it's is it weird because of the military base thing? Or tell me why it's weird. The country where you receive mail?

320
00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:01.370
P1: Maybe in the broad picture, because it's military. And it's global i guess

321
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:13.370
Tyler:  but and my mind is saying, the assumption is automatically the us maybe II have the think, have the wrong thinking in that area.

322
00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:37.479
Tyler: Yeah. So if I think if I'm understanding you correctly, you're getting like this feeling that this is favoring, or you know, another word might be like the majority of people are in the Us that are using the form. But for some reason. It's assuming that many people could be outside the Us. Currently serving outside the Us. And this station someplace. I see that.

323
00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:43.070
Tyler: Yeah, no, I'm just yeah. That makes sense, I think what I totally understand what you're saying. It feels like it kind of like

324
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:48.679
Tyler: first assumed you weren't in the Us. And then it was like, Are you in the Us. So I can see how that's funny.

325
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:51.010
P1: But we should default. And I'm in the Us. Event.

326
00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:54.309
Tyler: Are you stationed overseas. Yeah.

327
00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:57.940
Tyler: alright, that that's really useful. Let's click continue.

328
00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:08.679
Tyler: And then here we're putting in your mailing address. Does anything stand out to you as different than what you're used to.

329
00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:09.640
P1: you know.

330
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:16.910
Tyler: Okay. we'll click. Continue. We'll pretend, like we filled this in with your address. And then what is this page asking for?

331
00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:34.660
P1: To make a choice of what the Post Office has as opposed to what you put in. Sometimes you see that they make this extended zip code and all this other stuff. So

332
00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:48.679
Tyler: then they said, Well, which one would you like to use? Okay, that's that's for you. So it's it sounds like something you've seen before, maybe on another website. And do you usually choose what you entered, or what they suggest.

333
00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:53.509
P1: or does it depend? Sometimes this is just something that's not what I.

334
00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.700
Tyler: Then sometimes they

335
00:39:55.740 --> 00:40:05.400
P1: make a suggestion of that enhance thing like the Zip code plus 4, you know. Okay, I can roll with that. There's no problem helps the post office. Right?

336
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:14.240
Tyler: Okay? So you'd have a read, and you'd make sure that the address they suggest makes sense. And then we would continue. Okay, let's go ahead and continue.

337
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:15.520
Tyler: Hmm.

338
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:23.850
Tyler: okay. So without clicking anything, yet, you can go ahead and look at this page.

339
00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.729
Tyler: And then I'd love for you to just describe this page to me. What's what's the purpose of it?

340
00:40:30.110 --> 00:40:36.089
P1: To make sure that you entered the information you thought you were entering, that you didn't enter something else.

341
00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:40.120
P1: causing a glitch in your communication.

342
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:48.399
Tyler: Okay? And then if you we're not going to click anything yet. But if you were looking at this page on your own. What would you probably do next?

343
00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:54.689
P1: I would probably say, I know my category and topic is correct. My question is correct.

344
00:40:54.760 --> 00:41:00.230
P1: Let me just reject the personal information. If I was going to check anything.

345
00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:07.010
Tyler: That's that's really interesting, I can see why why you do that. So let's open category and topic. Let's just have a look real quick.

346
00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:11.640
Tyler:  can you show me how you do that? Okay, perfect. And

347
00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:16.290
Tyler: is this kind of what you expected to see.

348
00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:23.849
Tyler: and it sounds like you wouldn't even really open this because you'd probably assume that that's that's right, do you think that's even something you would change at this point.

349
00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:29.080
No.

350
00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:33.989
P1: my question. II mean, I've been all over the Internet world. My question was about

351
00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.249
Tyler: hearing loss. Right? Yeah. Oh, we're fine. We're good.

352
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:50.710
Tyler: Let's go ahead and open personal information, which it sounds like is the only one you'd probably open in real life. Yeah, okay? And you can just have a quick look through this. And

353
00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:55.260
Tyler: you can tell me if anything's jumping out at you. Feel free to scroll if you like.

354
00:41:55.270 --> 00:42:23.339
P1: Okay, so so I would just scroll through all. Would they have as far as relationship? Okay, relief. I would then scroll. I would scroll through all of this. Okay relationship. I'm the veteran. Okay, no name, you know. Last name, you know, for you know, social security last 4 or 5 which would be good, but that they don't just put your full social security on everything of birth. Fine. Pronounce.

355
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:25.150
P1: Gender. Okay?

356
00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:30.930
P1: My facility. Okay, I would just run down the list phone number email.

357
00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:39.859
P1: you know, contact the Us. Mail my address. Now. Okay, the one I put in and scrolled it. I mean, I scanned it. Sure. No fine.

358
00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:55.280
Tyler: Okay, perfect. So you'd scan through everything in the personal information you'd just be checking. It's all right. Let's say that you realized your phone number was typed in wrong. Can you show me what you would do? Let's go ahead and go to the edit. Then.

359
00:42:55.690 --> 00:43:01.730
P1: okay, so contact information edit. okay? And then.

360
00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:10.339
P1: yeah, go ahead. We're not gonna type or click anything here. But just describe to me. Just go in here where it says, the phone number

361
00:43:10.930 --> 00:43:14.079
P1: put in the right numbers, and then I will go to the update button.

362
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:25.890
Tyler: Got it cool. That's really helpful. That felt pretty straightforward for you. It's it looks like we can edit our phone number here. What else can we edit in this section the email in case. The email was

363
00:43:26.410 --> 00:43:32.609
P1: wrong, you know. Give it a quick look. There, okay, start black. We're good. And I would

364
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:43.649
P1: continue, what about your contact preference like we chose to be contacted by us. Mail. Can you edit that here? Oh, wow! You can't! I don't think

365
00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:50.310
P1:  no, it doesn't show an edit option.

366
00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.370
Tyler: Hmm.

367
00:43:51.760 --> 00:44:00.329
P1:  unless that II don't know doesn't join edit option unless it's in the email address.

368
00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.590
P1: Bennett, Pat.

369
00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:05.809
P1: which is, I mean the mailing address edit package.

370
00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:11.090
Tyler: Umhm. yeah. Why do you think that you can't edit that one there?

371
00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:26.109
Tyler: Cause there's no box dots? There's no anything. Yeah, yeah, I can see that. And do do you know why that that might be? Does it feel like it's a mistake? Does it feel like it's intentional by the website?

372
00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:33.200
P1: Maybe maybe they're not

373
00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:58.489
P1:  II don't know why it would be intentional to not have the ability to change that, even though if you change that, you would have to delete all of that other address, country, and all that stuff, you know. I think all of it could easily be done. I'm I'm not sure

374
00:44:58.870 --> 00:45:08.679
Tyler: cool. Well, I think that's a that's a good answer. We're gonna click cancel. We'll just pretend like you didn't actually need to edit your phone number, we'll just click cancel.

375
00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:14.150
Tyler: And then we're gonna submit your question. So we're gonna be like, everything looks good ready to go.

376
00:45:14.350 --> 00:45:16.140
P1: So I'll hit submit

377
00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:20.659
Tyler: alright. I'm going to give you a minute to read this.

378
00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:40.860
P1: Okay.

379
00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:45.399
Tyler: okay, so can you summarize a little bit of what you read to me?

380
00:45:45.620 --> 00:45:54.270
P1: Okay? So so the questions from submitted successfully gave me a confirmation number that would be sent to the email which I would need.

381
00:45:54.530 --> 00:45:57.899
P1: you know, for permanent storage, then

382
00:45:57.940 --> 00:46:13.880
P1: says that you'll receive a reply in the mail within 7 business days, you know. I'm sorry. That's just funny. I think that's fair enough.

383
00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:20.239
Tyler: And is there any information here that you feel like is missing? Is there anything else you'd need to know at this point

384
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.589
P1: just they should put in there. But yeah.

385
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:32.780
P1: you should receive a reply through us mail and email, you know, I, everything else is fine.

386
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:42.559
Tyler: Yeah. So if you is that because if you chose us mail. I know you wouldn't. But if you did choose us mail, you'd also want an email.

387
00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.760
P1: Yeah.

388
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:49.090
P1: yeah, that makes sense. I mean, maybe maybe someone doesn't use email. They.

389
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:53.750
P1: I don't know you're using a computer. Why would you not have email? So

390
00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.030
P1: right?

391
00:46:56.120 --> 00:47:03.239
Tyler: Yeah. and what do you think's gonna happen next like you just submitted your question. What's the the next step for you?

392
00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:06.229
P1: For me? For you?

393
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:26.330
P1: I would probably just because usually it says you'll receive your reference number is this, you'll receive an email confirmation. I would have expected that to happen immediately. So you'd probably check that. You have an email confirmation. And then you'd kind of be like, I've done my bit.

394
00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:31.299
P1: Yeah, wait my 7 days. See?

395
00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:40.799
Tyler: So it sounds like, usually you choose phone or email instead of the mail. So let's say that. Say you chose phone. You know I want you to call me when you have an answer for me.

396
00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:42.780
P1: and the Va. Calls you

397
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:53.440
Tyler: and they give you some information. And then you kind of hang up. And you're like, okay, let me figure out what I do next? And you had a follow-up question. what would you do in that scenario?

398
00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:58.840
P1: I hung up the phone, though you hung up the phone.

399
00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:09.230
Tyler: They said, this is the answer. I'll see you later. And they hung up and you were done. But 2 days later you had a follow up question. What would you do, I'd go back to the website and ask the answer question.

400
00:48:09.630 --> 00:48:17.770
Tyler: You'd you'd answer, and you'd ask another question. Yeah, that makes sense to me.

401
00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:31.840
Tyler: Well, we've talked a lot about this prototype. I think what we can do for the next 8 or so minutes is just kind of reflect on what we did together. We can stop sharing your screen. So if you see the stop

402
00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:35.890
Tyler: sharing button, it should be read somewhere towards the top, maybe

403
00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:37.780
P1: right there. Perfect.

404
00:48:39.110 --> 00:48:44.330
Tyler:  So what do you think of that process overall? Is there anything that you liked about it?

405
00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:50.780
P1:  that I liked about it

406
00:48:54.580 --> 00:49:02.260
P1: hopefully, because I didn't see the end result so hopefully that the question goes right to where it needs to go to, and that will be fine.

407
00:49:02.790 --> 00:49:13.420
P1:  What? What? I don't know if our talking through it made it seem like long

408
00:49:13.610 --> 00:49:14.700
P1: and

409
00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:20.080
P1: losing my place in the process. Maybe there's just cause we have a discussion.

410
00:49:20.930 --> 00:49:22.010
P1: But

411
00:49:23.620 --> 00:49:24.979
P1: no, I think it's fine

412
00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.099
P1: other than I think it's fine.

413
00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:29.980
P1: you know, and hopefully that

414
00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:40.860
P1: the program itself be streamlined, that the question would go where needs to go was one glitch. There was one glitch

415
00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:42.580
P1: where it went from

416
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:49.719
P1: healthcare to you. Just wanna talk you, you know you wanna chill out. Or you know.

417
00:49:49.780 --> 00:50:09.970
Tyler: Right? Yeah, I noticed that it felt like you were like, II get it with the forms doing. I'm following the process. And then it was like what there's like, this kind of like different thing. Yeah, II totally understand that. So

418
00:50:10.030 --> 00:50:26.509
Tyler: yeah, I mean, it's it's tricky, because we did talk a lot while we went through the process. So it does make it feel longer. But I also think throughout the process you were describing to me how many steps would you'd expect to be next? And it was always more than you expected. So you'd say, I think it's gonna be 2 more steps.

419
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:41.339
Tyler: and you were kind of over estimating, based on your experience, and it was still more steps. So I think it still wasn't totally meeting your expectations, not as streamlined. But I will say that additional steps seem to have

420
00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:46.330
P1: be part of another package of the information collection. So

421
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:48.140
P1: okay.

422
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:49.770
P1: okay

423
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.950
P1: you know.

424
00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:53.260
Tyler: yeah, okay. So it's like.

425
00:50:53.340 --> 00:51:05.509
Tyler: not so frustrating because you're like, I kind of understand why they're asking me the thing or why they might need this. But I am kind of surprised that there's this many pages. Yeah.

426
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:09.160
P1: I mean. yeah, there was a lot of paces.

427
00:51:10.020 --> 00:51:15.829
Tyler:  I think I'll wrap up with, just like maybe 2 more questions. So one of them is just

428
00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:26.730
Tyler: throughout the process. I was asking you how much longer this would take. Did you ever notice that there was a bar at the top of the screen that says the number of steps.

429
00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.140
P1: But I didn't notice that. No.

430
00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:36.750
Tyler: no, that's okay. That's it was helpful for me to see that that wasn't noticeable. So that was really useful. You have a blinking.

431
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:52.089
Tyler: It wasn't blinking. No? Oh, you mean we could make it blinking. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's one way.

432
00:51:52.090 --> 00:52:11.339
P1: II applied for a visa when I was traveling internationally, and they had a thing on the it's electronic form. So you've been on this page for 17 s, 18 s, 19 s. It's like, Okay, I don't know what's the deadline. Let me get off this page?

433
00:52:11.340 --> 00:52:31.910
Tyler: Right? Okay? So yeah, there's probably a balance. For that. Overall. Did you feel like the form was descriptive enough? Were there moments when you wanted like more detail. Like, you know, healthcare was really easy for you to choose. But did you feel like there was moments when you wanted more detail, or it was the right amount of detail.

434
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:35.730
Tyler: That question was going to. Yeah.

435
00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:43.559
P1: Do you think you'd want to know that when you chose health care, or at the very end. Okay, health care, audiology. And

436
00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.600
P1: whatever the other word was, okay.

437
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.650
P1: your question will be directed to.

438
00:52:49.970 --> 00:53:01.679
P1: I don't know what you know. That might be something you would like to have.

439
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:06.339
P1: I want to feel like

440
00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:17.570
P1: the people the skilled people are handling this issue.

441
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:23.639
P1: and nothing about receptionist, but to the reception, you know.

442
00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:35.790
P1: Yeah, no, that makes sense. I mean, we're asking you a lot of questions to make sure your your question goes to the right place. So I can see how you also want reassurance that that is happening. Cause you're putting in the work.

443
00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:38.860
Tyler: I think that's really clear. And

444
00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:49.330
Tyler: I guess, overall. How does this compare to other experiences of maybe you've contacted a bank or another company online?

445
00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:51.620
Tyler: how does this compare

446
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:02.739
P1: and think of who I've contacted for

447
00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:03.950
Tyler: question.

448
00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:16.479
Tyler: I I'm sorry, but I don't have much of a comparison. I don't. That's okay. That's I don't know or I can't remember or anything like that is always an acceptable answer.

449
00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:32.319
Tyler: Well, I've asked you a lot of questions, and I just want to leave a little bit of time for you to ask me any questions. Do you have any questions, maybe, about this process about what we're doing, or anything like that? No, no, no, I'm glad you guys are working, and, you know, make things easy and

450
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:36.400
P1: good to be commended.

451
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:51.229
Tyler: Well, we really appreciate you, because, yeah, there's a lot of things that we can't do without that the support and the help from veterans like yourself. So I know it's a lot of things differently because of what you told.

452
00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:59.299
P1: the information that I give might not be as beneficial because the people who need help.

453
00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:08.730
P1: I'm more the focus. And I kind of can just navigate through these things like a lot of stuff. I just skip, skip, skip.

454
00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:20.140
Tyler: II hear you on that. Other people can't get there like that, and I feel bad for them, you know. Whatever you can do to make it easy for them is is good. Yeah, no, I appreciate that. And I think

455
00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:47.130
Tyler: it's been a common experience for me when I speak to veterans like yourself, where they're like, I want you to remember that not everybody's gonna have as easy a time as me using this website. So II totally respect that. And II guess, for peace of mind, a lot of what we try and do as researchers is, make sure we're talking to people from all different sorts of backgrounds, experiences, level of like computer use and all that kind of thing so that we can try and make that that better. But

456
00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:52.430
Tyler: so your feedback is really helpful for different reasons than maybe another person's feedback. So

457
00:55:52.620 --> 00:56:10.900
Tyler: but I appreciate you always reminding us of that. Well, I hope you have a lovely rest of your day. Perigee, and the folks who set up this session are going to send you a thank you. Note and they'll give you information that you can pass on to other veterans if you want to participate in in future, if they want to participate in future sessions.

458
00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:21.469
P1: And yeah, I hope you have a lovely day, and you too, and all the other listeners.
