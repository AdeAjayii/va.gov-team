## Intro (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Tyler]. How are you?

I’m a researcher from VA. I work on improving VA.gov so it's easier for Veterans to contact VA online if they have a question.

**What I hope to do today** is get a sense of how we can make this process better.

**What I don't want to do** is add to any frustration that may have led you to contact VA - or even frustration you've had with actually contacting VA - in the past. I want to be up front and say that I don't have a way of fixing those past experiences. But, I do want to know about your frustrations in case they're things we can improve in the future.

So before we get started, when Perigean set up this session, they asked if you’re okay with a couple of observers joining us. This helps my team members learn from our conversation as well, and they also help me take notes so we capture everything you share.

**I want to confirm now, are you okay with a couple of my teammates joining us to observe?**

- `IF NO` Use Slack to let observers know.
- `IF YES` They're in the waiting room, so I'm going to let them into the meeting now.

> Let in observers from the waiting room.

Welcome. Can everyone say hello? This is `PARTICIPANT`.

**Thanks everyone, now I’ll ask you to turn off your cameras and mute yourselves for the rest of the session.**

There are a few other things I want to mention before we start:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I’ll make sure we finish on time, so I may occasionally move us along during the session, so we can cover everything.
- **We’re here to learn your honest opinions.** Negative feedback is helpful too, because it helps us learn how we can improve.
- **I also want to make it clear that we’re not testing your ability.** So, for example, if I ask if you understand something, it’s because I want to make sure writing is clear.
- **I’m going to share a prototype with you today.** This is like a test version of the website, so it may not work exactly how you expect. For example, you’ll be able to click some buttons, but not all of them.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, you just have to let me know.** And that might be a pause to get some water or to stop the session completely. You'll be paid even if we don't complete the full session.
- Last thing is about recordings. We can record the session to help us confirm we captured your opinions accurately and sometimes share video clips with our colleagues at VA. If we do this, we don’t link anything you share in the session to any information that could identify you. We remove your face and your name from the videos. **Knowing this, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - `IF NO` Don't record
  - `IF YES` Once I start recording, I’ll confirm again.

> Start recording: `RECORD TO CLOUD`.

I’ve started recording. I'd like to confirm again: **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?**

## Warm up (5 minutes)

Alright, it sounds like we’re ready to get started. I'd like to begin by learning more about your experience with VA and our online services.

- How long have you been a Veteran?
- How often do you go online to use VA services, like, schedule a medical appointment or check your benefits?
- Have you ever contacted VA online or over the phone?
  - `IF NO`
    - Why might you contact VA?
    - If you were going to contact VA, would you prefer to call, go online or get in touch another way?
  - `IF YES`
    - Can you tell me about a time when you contacted VA?
    - How do you usually contact VA? Why?
      - `IF ONLINE` Did you use your phone, tablet or computer?
    - How was the support you received?

**Key things to note:**

- Why do they choose to contact VA (instead of elsewhere, or another task)?
- How do they decide which channel to use when they contact VA?

## Start page (5 minutes)

Thanks, it’s helpful to learn about your experience with VA.

Next, I’d like to share some ideas to get your feedback.

In the Zoom chat, I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier a prototype is like a test version of a website. It might not work perfectly, but this way we can learn what we need to improve before we share it with more Veterans.

> Send link in Zoom chat.

- Can you please open the link in the chat?
- Have you shared your screen on Zoom before?
  - `IF YES` Great. Can you please share your screen?
  - `IF NO` I’ll walk you through how to do that…

Thanks! Now I’m able to see your screen too.

> Screen: Start page

Okay, now that we have this open, we’re not going to click on anything yet. 

First, I'll give you a second to read the page more closely.

- Can you tell me what you notice first on this page?
- What is this page about?

For the rest of our conversation, I’d like you to imagine that you need to ask VA a question. Let's say it's a question about a recent experience you had at a VA medical center.

- What would you do first if you wanted to ask a question about an experience you had at a VA medical center?
  - Where would you click?
  - Why would you click `Sign in` (or) `Continue without signing in`?
- Does it seem like you need to sign in, in order to start?
  - What if your question was about education benefits?
- Are there any (other) benefits of signing in?
- How long would you expect it to take to ask a question?
- What do you expect to happen when we click `Continue without signing in`?

Let’s go ahead and click `Continue without signing in`.

**Key things to note:**

- Where are they most likely to click first?
- Is it clear when they need to sign in or when it is optional?
- Are the benefits of signing in (besides when it’s required) clear?
- Is the purpose of Ask VA clear at this point?

## Chapter 1: Category and topic (5 minutes)

> Screen: Category

Okay, so I mentioned earlier that we’re imagining that you want to ask a question about an experience you recently had at a VA medical center. With that in mind…

- Can you show me what you would do first on this page?
  - Why would you choose `Health care` or [whatever they choose]?
- Why do you think the VA is asking you this question?
- How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?
- How long do you think this process is going to take?
- Before we move on, what do you expect to see on the next page?
- How would you move on to the next question? Can you show me?

Great, next we’ll click 'Continue'.

**Key things to notice:**
- Do they recognize why they need to choose a category?
- Do they think it’s important to choose the right one?
- Is it straightforward to use the select menu?
- Do they choose `Health care` without being prompted?
- Do they notice the progress bar? Does it impact their idea of how long the form is?

> Screen: Topic

Before we click on anything…

- Can you tell me what you would do first on this page?
- (Why do you think VA is asking you this question?)
- (How important do you think it is to answer this question correctly?)
- How is this question different from the last one you answered?
- What does it mean, where it says, ‘Your category and topic’?
- What if you couldn’t find an option that fit your needs, what would you do?

Great. Let’s go ahead and choose `Getting care at a local VA medical center` and then click `Continue`.

**Key things to notice:**
- Do they notice a difference between this page (topic) and the previous (category)?
- Is it clear you can only choose 1 option?
- Do they choose `Getting care at a local VA medical center` without being prompted?
- Is there any confusion about the running summary?
- If they can’t find an option, what would they do?
