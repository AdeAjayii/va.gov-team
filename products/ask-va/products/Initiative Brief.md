Executive Summary
AVA is an online portal that allows Veterans, caregivers, and supporting personnel in education, debt, loans,  etc. to submit questions to VA and receive a secure message response.

Currently, Ask VA (AVA) resides within a stand-alone Microsoft portal that is inconsistent with the VA design standards, is not mobile-friendly, and has accessibility issues. 

AVA on the modernized VA.gov platform will be a digital support channel that works with other tools and features on VA.gov and VA ecosystem to quickly and accurately answer users' questions. Users should feel it is easy and intuitive to submit their issues and receive adequate updates and information that results in a final resolution. Ultimately, we want AVA to feel part of a cohesive and user-centered approach to support.

Team Questions
Assumptions


Preliminary Research Plan
Research goals [DRAFT]
Understand how users expect to start an inquiry
Understand how users categorize topics and subtopics
Understand which outcome(s) a user expects to get out of Ask VA
Review where Ask VA should live and be linked to from
Research questions [DRAFT]
Understand how users expect to start an inquiry
Do they expect to start by entering free text?
Do they expect to start by selecting a topic or subtopic?
Are there alternative ways that users expect to start their inquiry?
Understand how users categorize topics and subtopics
Which topics do users contact us about (in their own words)?
How do they break topics into subtopics (in their own words)?
Understand which outcome(s) a user expects from Ask VA
What does a user expect to receive (FAQs, a link to a page on VA.gov, specific information related to their query, help from a real person) from Ask VA?
Why are they using Ask VA for their inquiry instead of another method?
Do they expect to talk to someone as an outcome? How soon? Or is this just if all else fails?
Review where Ask VA should live and be linked to from
Where do Veterans expect to go to find Ask VA?
Where are Veterans when they realize they might need to ask a question?


Solution Approach/Hypotheses 
Phase 1 MVP:
Stand up a page on VA.gov
Create a SPIKE to validate the instructions from the VA’s developer docs for adding a new application to the va.gov site.
Bring Ask VA up to VA.gov design standards
Narrow down scope of use cases; including authenticated vs. unauthenticated.
We need to see if the full scope can be implemented in the MVP after understanding use cases, taxonomy and routing rules.
Write topics and categories based on content style guide (without changing form functionality and output).
Write form questions based on content style guide (without changing form functionality and output).
Update UI to reflect the VA Design System.
Make it mobile friendly.
Do iterative user research to test usability of new form design and content updates.
Make it 508 Compliant.
Complete necessary PRA updates.
Implement form on VA.gov
Understand current routing rules
Review existing Ask VA front-end and back-end code to see how it works
When Inquiry data is collected on VA.gov, it is sent to the Dynamics CRM for the agents to work through
Releasing this new form to a page on VA.gov
Build GitHub Actions workflows for deploying to DEV/STAGiNG/PROD, with automated tests and linting as the gatekeepers to those environments.
Understand how Dataverse and CxDW(?) play into this process.
Ensure devs have proper tools and permissions to build the legacy app, and work on the prototype code.
Ensure devs have proper access to resources in all environments.
Ensure devs/qa/pm have access to error logs.
Ensure devs/qa/pm/ux have access to analytics and reporting.
Add tools to build pipeline to run static analysis for 508 and mobile-friendly issues.
Understand auth and unauth access patterns. Be ready for oauth changes in the coming months from platform/identity team.

Timeline
Unanswered Questions
How does this affect things if we can’t handle Secure Messaging out-of-the gate? Need a reminder about how Secure Messaging currently works (do they need to go to MHV to see messages answered by Contact Center agents from AVA?).
