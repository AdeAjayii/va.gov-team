# Category, topic, and subtopic scope for Phase 1
Last updated by @beckyphung on November 7, 2023

This document outlines the scope of category, topic, and subtopic changes for Phase 1 of the Ask VA front-end redesign to VA.gov. 

These changes are documented in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qRpAwE-OmISFzYsg4w3n8VlBsxJxkBAFZL21AWDXFKc/edit#gid=0). It also shows these characteristics, but these aren't changes:
- category in order of rank field (ranked by usage)
- topic and subtopic in alphabetical order (apart from 'Other' - see "Nice to have" updates below)

**Jump to**
- ["Must Have" updates for Phase 1](#must-have-updates-for-phase-1)
- ["Nice to Have" updates for Phase 1](#nice-to-have-updates-for-phase-1)

## "Must Have" updates for Phase 1
- Changes to category, topic and subtopic names only
- Adding new topic or subtopic with an existing routing queue
- Adding new topic or subtopic with a completely new routing queue
- Removing current topic or subtopic

## "Nice to Have" updates for Phase 1

- Moving 'Other' topic or subtopic to the bottom of the list

### Evidence
We'll have the following evidence to support these updates: 
- Reviews with each business line, including meetings and email follow-ups
- Reviews with the VA.gov content team, who oversees all content on VA.gov
- Alignment with the VA.gov content style guide
- (pending) Clear understanding of development effort for updates, especially the "Must Have" updates

## Note that usability testing will **not** focus on:
- the category, topic and subtopics names, apart from the health care category
- the addition of new topics or removal of old topics
- routing queues
- moving 'other' to the bottom of the list (not present in the flow we're testing)
