# [Draft] Category, topic, and subtopic scope for Phase 1
Last updated by @beckyphung on 10/30/2023

This document outlines the scope of category, topic, and subtopic changes for Phase 1 of the Ask VA front-end redesign to VA.gov.

## These changes are documented in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qRpAwE-OmISFzYsg4w3n8VlBsxJxkBAFZL21AWDXFKc/edit#gid=0), which includes:

- changes to category, topic and subtopic names (existing)
- addition of new topic or subtopic
- removal of old topic or subtopic
- routing queues for new topics and subtopics
- 'other' topic or subtopic moved to the bottom of the list

### Evidence
We'll have the following evidence to support these changes: 
- Reviews with each business line, including meetings and email follow-ups
- Reviews with the VA.gov content team, who oversees all content on VA.gov
- Alignment with the VA.gov content style guide
- (pending) Clear understanding of ordering options under category/topic/subtopic

## It also shows these characteristics, but these aren't changes:
- category in order of rank field (ranked by usage)
- topic and subtopic in alphabetical order (apart from 'other' - see above)

## Note that usability testing will **not** focus on:
- the category, topic and subtopics names, apart from the health care category
- the addition of new topics or removal of old topics
- routing queues
- moving 'other' to the bottom of the list (not present in the flow we're testing)
