# Multilingual content prioritization

This document explains how we prioritize content for translation on VA.gov. Note that this applies only to content that's directly for Veterans, service members, and their family members. We don't translate content for other audiences.

Here are the inputs we use to prioritize content for translation:
- Policy guidance on vital information to translate
- Analytics on most visited content in languages other than English
- Usability research with Veterans and family members
- Data on benefit and health care needs of specific populations

## Prioritizing languages

For VA.gov, we aim to prioritize languages based on these 2 factors:




## Prioritizing content by language

### Priority 1: COVID-19 vaccine and benefit access information

This content is our top priority for translation. It includes the following types of content:

- Basic content on how to get a COVID-19 vaccine (including boosters) at VA and relevant associated information
- Basic information about how to access COVID-19 testing at VA
- How the coronavirus pandemic may impact VA benefits and services

### Priority 2: Basic rights and assistance content

This content is our 2nd top priority for translation. It includes these 3 types of content:

- Content that explains Veterans' basic rights at VA (such as civil rights and patient rights) and how to file complaints or get help to resolve concerns
- Content that explains how to get access to language assistance (such as how to get an interpreter by phone or in person)
- Content about the IRS 1095-B form from VA

### Priority 2: Vital benefit content for initial benefit access

This content is our 2nd top priority for translation. It includes this content for each benefit:

- Basic eligibilty information
- Basic information on how to apply (not including the online application)

Refer to the next section for how we're prioritizing content by benefit.

### Priority 3: Select, high-value vital benefit content for fully accessing and managing benefits, with an emphasis on content that requires a response from the Veteran or family member

This content includes select additional benefit content that meets either of these criteria:

- The content requires a response or action from the Veteran or family member that, if not taken, could lead to negative consequences for that individual (such as content on debt)
- Analytics and research show the content to be of particular importance to Veterans and family members with limited English proficiency (for example, medical appointments and travel reimbursement)

## Prioritizing content by benefit

Within vital benefit content for initial access, we prioritize benefits based on need.
