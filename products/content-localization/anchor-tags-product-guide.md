All product guides should be created and saved as a word document. You will need to use screenshots as well as text to demonstrate the key functionality of your product. A complete product guide will include the following:

## Table of Contents:

This is the roadmap to each portion of your writing. Please inclue the following sections in your table of contents and link each to its corresponding location in the Product Guide:

Product Overview
User Access
Navigation
Functionality
Major Issues and Error Messages

## Product Overview:

Today, question/answer links are not generated in a way that's easily accessible by users. So when a Veteran, caregiver or customer service representative wants to direct someone to a specific question/answer on a page, they can only share a link at the page level leaving it up to the recipient to navigate through what can be a long list of information to find the specific content they seek. This can be frustrating and time-consuming.

The goal of this experiment is to make it quick and painless to share specific content contained within a page and the Corona FAQ page will be used for this pilot: https://www.va.gov/coronavirus-veteran-frequently-asked-questions/ 

## User Access:

Users do not need to be signed into use this feature. The feature is available for a user, whether or not they have a VA.gov account.

## Functionality:

This section will go over the actual functionality of your product. Depending on the complexity of your product, this section will be the longest part of your product guide. We know it is difficult to point out every single feature of the product, particularly for an application, but please provide as much detail as possible because it helps contact center agents better address veteran questions. If your product has different stages or sections, we recommend breaking this section into subsections to cover the different parts of your product (i.e. wizards, different sections of an application, etc).
