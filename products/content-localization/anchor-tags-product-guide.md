## Product Overview:

Today, question/answer links are not generated in a way that's easily accessible by users. So when a Veteran, caregiver or customer service representative wants to direct someone to a specific question/answer on a page, they can only share a link at the page level leaving it up to the recipient to navigate through what can be a long list of information to find the specific content they seek. This can be frustrating and time-consuming.

The goal of this experiment is to make it quick and painless to share specific content contained within a page and the Corona FAQ page will be used for this pilot: https://www.va.gov/coronavirus-veteran-frequently-asked-questions/ 

## User Access:

Users do not need to be signed into use this feature. The feature is available for a user, whether or not they have a VA.gov account.

## Functionality:

This section will go over the actual functionality of your product. Depending on the complexity of your product, this section will be the longest part of your product guide. We know it is difficult to point out every single feature of the product, particularly for an application, but please provide as much detail as possible because it helps contact center agents better address veteran questions. If your product has different stages or sections, we recommend breaking this section into subsections to cover the different parts of your product (i.e. wizards, different sections of an application, etc).

 - The copy icon will be visible at the end of each question
 - Upon hovering (on desktop), the square enclosing the icon will change color to help users understand that the icon is actionable
 - Once clicked, the text "Link copied" is displayed next to the icon for 10 seconds
 - On click/tap when using a screen reader, the screen reader will announce the "Link copied" text and keep the focus on the button
 - The accessible label will contain relevant, content specific titles for the screen reader to announce, e.g. “Copy [How can I stay informed about COVID-19 vaccines at VA] sharable link”.
 - When the button + text cannot be displayed to the right of the button (because there is not enough room to the right of the button), it displays to the left, overlapping the h3
