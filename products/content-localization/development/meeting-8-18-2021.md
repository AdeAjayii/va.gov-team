## Notes from 8/18/2021 meeting

**Attendees:** Dave, Mike, Eunice, Michelle, Adam, Sharon

**CMS Fields:**

- Entity Reference Field and Language Field addition would require a PR to add in via a Drupal config file change
    - The config file can be exported from a sandbox and then added to the repo for PR
- The fields will most likely be discarded in the future when a public api is exposed for content via Drupal
    - Once the api is available, the discovery of adding the official multi-lingual modules to Drupal can be done, and a roadmap for migrating from the Entity      Reference Fields would be created to assist in moving existing content appropriately
- The scope of using Entity Reference Fields approach should be limited
    - For example, we may want to limit to the main page content type such as Benefits Detail Page
    - Sharon working with Analytics to add tracking for Google translate events (should be ready to test week of 8/23)
    - we should minimize the amount/type of translated content for the POC
        - 100 pages max
        - Adam recommends only 10-20 for POC to minimize migration effort down the road

**Weblate:**

- Standing up the service will take work; some considerations that will need to be taken into account include:
    - Who will be using the service (internal VA employees vs external translators)? May need to provide firewall access
    - Whether the provider Fed-ramped
    - Additional type and number of resources needed
- ATO considerations have to be addressed:
    - Access levels of the service could impact complexity of ATO requirements
- The options are:
    - Self-host in AWS but not publicly accessible
    - Self-host in AWS but is publicly accessible
    - SAAS based...must be fed-ramped
- A content sync process would need to be engineered to move content and translations between the systems in some way. If we had an open cms api we wouldnâ€™t need this
- Adding more complexity by adding the additional service seems somewhat unnecessary overhead if we can centralize the process (multilingual modules in drupal)

**Content-build Updates:**

- CMS is moving to an open REST api
- React I18n solution would be the main translation implementation that we would need to focus on, in addition to client api calls and routing
- Forms translations could be migrated to an api based solution and could be an easier process than content at this point
- Long term, full integration of content localization relies on an open content api

**Take-aways:**

- All translations and strings could be managed in the CMS, and applications would pull CMS information about translations from api and show it accordingly
- Alternatively, the content translations can live in the CMS, and the application translations can live at the code level in JSON files
    - If the need arises to move all translations for apps to CMS, then the migration could be in the secondary engineering phase after MVP, and after the public api is available
- Forms is the next main area of work for C&L team; supporting translations in the applications will need to be part of the new form system
    - Approach may be to start translation support for only new forms and over time, migrate to the new forms library with translation support for all legacy form library apps
