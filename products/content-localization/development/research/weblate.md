# Weblate - Web-based continuous localization

### Description

A Python 3.6+ (Django Framework) based application that provides localization for applications and content. The weblate interface is organized into projects and components, and each project can contain a number of components that contain translations into individual languages. Each component correlates to a translatable file (PO, MO, JSON, etc).

### Hosting

* self hosted or cloud-hosted
  * Dedicated Cloud hosting vary in price depending on the amount of translated content
    * [https://weblate.org/en/hosting/#hosted](https://weblate.org/en/hosting/#hosted)
  * Self hosting is done via a Docker (prefered) deployment or virtualenv on a *nix based system
    * Other required services include PostreSQL db, Redis server, and an SMTP server.
    * [Installation Docs](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/admin/install.html#installing-weblate)

### Authentication

* Uses Python Social Auth, but registration can be turned off to prevent new users.
* Other authentication systems including Active Directory, LDAP, or SAML could also be used with configuration.
* For the built-in REST api there is no authentication required (throttled to 100 req/day) or a user can provide an Authorization header with a token that is accessed via a user's profile (throttled to 5000 req/hr)
  * Throttling can be configured via settings.py see: [Throttling in Django](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/throttling/)
  * Authentication and Auth can be changed via standard Django preferences

### Integration

* Weblate has been developed with VCS integration in mind as itâ€™s core feature, so the easiest way is to grant Weblate the access to your repository.

  * This most likely would not be possible due to needing translations for several repos and also access control restrictions.
  * Instead of commiting translation files directly to our VCS, the REST api provided by Weblate would be the most viable option for integrating into our systems.
    * Each project and component can be accessed via the REST api and the json file for translations can be retrieved. Example:
* For JavaScript applications the recommended file format is [JSON i18next v3](https://docs.weblate.org/en/latest/formats.html#js-i18next)
* * JSON i18next files are monolingual, so a base file (english version) has to be configured within each Weblate component.
    * It boils down that each project translation would have its own set of files (en.json, es.json, tl.json)
    * This many files poses a performance concern, as 10,000 pages with 3 translations equates to 30,000 files
    * If these files are requested and then integrated into the SSG process then build time will go up significantly.
* Integration for our content-build / cms content would need to be custom built due to the Metalsmith project complexity.

  * If we used JSON i18next files we may be able to adapt this (unfortunately unmaintained) Metalsmith plugin: [metalsmith-i18next](https://github.com/macprog-guy/metalsmith-i18next)
  * If we used this, what would be the process to integration, and how could we test this?
* Could we just use this for the React applications?

  * What benefits would this application bring versus just maintaining translation files in the repos themselves per application?
  * How would the translations be updated and maintained for applications, and what audit process could be followed?
* How would access be granted to this application and who is responsible for translations? If the application and cms translations lived on Weblate, then various people would probably be needed.

### PROS

* An open source platform would avoid any vendor lock-in
* Weblate may be able to manage drupal content as well as application / form level translations
* Extendible via python and Django modules
* Support is available for hosted or self-hosted installs (basic, extended, and premium levels)
* Installation and customization services available

### Cons

* Python / Django will require dedicated engineers to update, extend, and maintain if self hosting
* A self hosted option could introduce security concerns and would require auditing
* Cloud based hosting may require higher costs, and migrating away could be difficult if needed
* The system deals with translations on a string by string basis, and if we used it to manage CMS translations as well as application translations, then we will most likely have problems translating complex CMS blocks that involve a WYSIWYG.
  * How would we maintain alt tag translations and other 'non single string' type translations that would occur with WYSIWYG types of content?

### POC Requirements

* Create local docker instance of Weblate
  * Document UI and ease of use considerations
  * Add Project and Components for a test app
* Prototype local react application with i18next
  * Pull translations from a file/api provided by weblate instance
  * Document pitfalls and issues that would occur while translating applications
* Set up local Drupal cms to access page content and integrate with weblate
  * Document process of how page content fields would sync to weblates projects and components
  * Can all fields be translated?
  * What accessibility issues exist? (alt text of images, aria attributes, etc)
  * What communication standards are being used, and how would this work within the VA firewall security?
* Prototype abilities to integrate Weblate translations into content-build system
  * Evaluate metalsmith-i18next plugin capabilities
* Is an actual live evaluation instance something that can be provisioned in the gov cloud system? How does one request something like this?
