# Non-Latin Character Language Content Discovery

Languages such as Chinese that do not use a Latin based character set need to be considered when displaying translated content.

- Created Chinese language version of **Covid-19 Vaccines at VA** page
- Translated content blocks into simplified chinese via google translate as to provide a rough approximation of the translated content.
- Published Chinese language page at https://web-nwlghnqkwe3ftxcgy830jkfejcxjswak.demo.cms.va.gov/covid-19-vaccines-at-va-chinese

### Takeaways

- From a basic non-chinese speaking perspective, the content seems to display correctly and no major layout issues are apparent
- The Chinese content actually appears to be shorter than English content due to condensed glyphs and less character counts for sentences
- Font usage appears to be falling back to "PingFang SC" for the Chinese characters so there would need to be a decision made if that is the font that we want to be using.

- Line heights appear to be larger than English page version, but the font size may be a bit small considering how complex some Chinese glyphs can be.

There are many resources online for guidelines to displaying translated text, and a more in depth review would need to be made by design, accessibility, and Chinese specific translator experts.
