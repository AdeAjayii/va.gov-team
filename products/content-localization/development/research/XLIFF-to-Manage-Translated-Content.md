# XLIFF and Translation Management


### The Drupal Translation Management Tools as well as the Content Translation modules are required to be installed for setting up translations and for exporting XLIFF files.

Translation Management allows translation 'jobs' to be created and at that point the content could be exported then reimported, or a local translator can use the built in translation UI to modify the translated content directly.
