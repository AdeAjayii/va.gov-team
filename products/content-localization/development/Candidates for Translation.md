Of the two forms that are shown as having an online version of them, the 21-526EZ is actually the form that is filled out for both forms https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim

### Overview of 21-526EZ Form Structure

The 21-526EZ is probably one of the most complex series of forms that is available online, and **would not make a good candidate** for a translated MVP form application. 

The codebase includes around 20 custom components, 6 custom UI containers, 72 custom content components, and a very complex form configuration setup. In addition there are also various document upload functionality that would need to be considered in a translated application.

### Conclusion

For these reasons, I don't believe that the 21-526EZ form would make a good prospective MVP form application for translation and a simpler form can be chosen. 

In looking at the other forms, we had previously discussed translating the vre/28-1900 for that lives at https://www.va.gov/careers-employment/vocational-rehabilitation/apply-vre-form-28-1900/start. The reasons for looking to translate this form would be that it is relatively simple and will give us a chance to dive into the technical needs of translating various components within the existing forms system. We could also evaluate other forms too for determining if a different form would be more
