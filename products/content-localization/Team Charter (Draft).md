</p>
</details>

#### Issue Etiquette
Anyone on the team can create a user story. All are responsible for keeping them up to date.

- For a story to go in the Backlog column and be groomed, it should have:
    - Clear acceptance criteria
    - Definition of done  
    - A user story that reflects the benefit to a Veteran, Caregiver, or other user
    - All components/steps have been accounted for in the epic
    
- For a task to go into the **"Icebox"** column, it must have the following:
   - Title that explains the goal
   - Labels: _vsa-caregivers_ and what category it falls into (backend, front-end, research, design, product)

- For a task to go into the **"Backlog"** column, it must have the following:
   - Title that explains the goal in plain language
   - Linked to a user story/epic
   - Includes (as needed) background, goal and acceptance criteria   

- For a task to go into the **"Ready"** column, it must have the following:
   - Estimate
   - Sense of priority (relative to other tickets)
   
- During Sprint Planning, we'll move tickets into the **"Current Sprint"** column
- As they are worked, tickets get moved into **"In Progress"**

- For a task to be in **"Blocked"** 
   - An external dependency prevents the ticket from being completed
   
- For a task to be in **"Validate"** 
   - All work related to the ticket is implemented
   - Acceptance criteria have been met
   - Work is accessible in a review instance and ready for internal team members to review

- For a task to be **"Done"** 
   - Internal validation has occured
   - Merged to master
   - Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect when validation has occurred and by whom
   - Any next steps (turning on in Production, stakeholder review, follow up tickets) have been documented

- If there are new work requests or sudden changes, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Estimation
We use fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to account for the level of effort, complexity, and amount of unknowns in our work. Here is our guide:
| Number | Meaning |
| -------| --------|
| 1  | Involves a single small trivial change.
| 2  | Small but non-trivial change, requires some care.
| 3  | (Baseline) Contains some complexity or uncertainty.
| 5  | Significant complexity and/or uncertainty.
| 8  | High level of complexity and/or uncertainty.
| 13 | Needs to be broken down; too large for one sprint; critical unknowns. 


#### User story validation
- All team members are responsible for validation, but different team members will specialize in different areas.
- For anything considered a "release" or significant change, Tze (the VSA QA lead) will be responsible for QA
- Engineers will be responsible for ensuring and documenting in the ticket that all acceptance criteria are met
- Design is responsible for ensuring that design and content specifications are met
- PM and PO will be responsible for end-to-end QA and communication to stakeholders


## Team Norms
- We are iterate often and deliver frequently
- We are respectful, both online and off
- We turn on cameras as often as possible at meetings / calls
- We are flexible and intentional in the way we work
- We communicate often and in public channels
- We ask questions when they arise
- We listen without judgement
- We keep our work simple and clean
- We validate each others' work
- We do reviews in independent environments
- We hold each other accountable
- We stick to our commitments as best as possible
- We are respectful of others' time

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### PTO
- Team members will send calendar invites to the rest of team when they have scheduled time off 

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
