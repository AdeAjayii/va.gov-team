- doesnt trust translation services such as google translate
- on other sites he can tap "espanol" which is helpful to him
- hasnt used an interpreter or needed one
### **NOW GO TO VA.GOV...**
he tries to sign on as he normally would do but had some difficulty and tried all 3 options (I didn't follow why he uses all 3 options and what problem was)
he needs to sign in bc he typically goes to site to make a dr's appt or apply for a refiil or a VA benefit
To finds from 2094, he would try VA.gov search bar first
Side note: he commented that he had recently sent in a form adn received a snail mail that there was an error. it didnt tell him where to get a new form or how to email info in (vs snail mail) but couldnt find an option for this.
he noted that he ususally ends up doing a google search to get the results he is looking for
### **NEXT went to Covid page**
- most of this part was in spanish
- when asked if he would share info with a friend he said he would but asked for a copy link (I think)
- Lastly, asked what info would be most improtatn to hiom to have in spanish and he said
  - making an appt
  - refill requests
  - apply for benefits like GI Bill, GI Loan and Education benefit
