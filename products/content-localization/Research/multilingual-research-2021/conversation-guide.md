## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today. My name is [Danielle/Eunice] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how VA can best meet the needs of Veterans and their family members and caregivers who may need or prefer content about VA benefits and services in Spanish. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet the needs of Veterans and their family members and caregivers. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

I'd like to start with learning a little more about you and how you use VA benefits and services.

- First, would you consider yourself a Veteran, a family member of a Veteran, or a caregiver for a Veteran?
- Can you tell me about any VA benefits or services that [you/the Veteran you care for] use now or have used in the past? _[follow-up questions as appropriate]_
- How often do you and [the Veteran/your family member] use VA.gov to get benefit and service information?
- Do you or [the Veteran/your family member] have a VA.gov account (like DS Logon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me)?

## First Task: Interview - 20 minutes

Now, I'm going to ask you some questions about how [you/your family member] get the information [you/they] need in [your/their] preferred language.

- In general, when [you/they] need information, do [you/they] prefer to read it in English or Spanish? Are there specific kinds of information or topics that [you/they] specifically prefer in Spanish? Can you tell me more about this?
- When it comes to applying for government or other benefits, do [you/they] feel more comfortable applying for a benefit using an application that's written in Spanish? Can you tell me about your experiences applying for benefits (either in English, in Spanish, or both)?
- How do [you/they] usually find access to information in Spanish? 
- If [you/they] search for information online, do [you/they] usually search for information that's translated into Spanish? Do [you/they] set your browser to Spanish? Can you tell me a bit about [your/their] experiences with translated content?
- Have you ever received interpreter or other language assistance from VA?
    - _If yes,_ Can you tell me about that experience? How did [you/they] ask for the services? What services did [you/they] receive? 
    - _If no,_ Have [you/they] ever needed interpreter or other language assistance from VA? 
      - _If yes_, Can you tell me why you think you didn't receive the help you needed?
      - _If no,_, If [you/they] did need an interpreter or translation services, how would you request those services?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant or their family member have specific types of information that they need in Spanish?
- What's helpful to the participant or their family member in terms of getting translated content? What's not helpful?
- Does the participant know that VA offers interpreter and translation services?
- If the participant or their family member has used interpreter or translation services at VA, what was their experience like?

## Second Task: Usability test part 1: VA.gov language assistance and resources pages - 15 - 20 minutes

Now I'd like to ask you to share your screen with me, so we can go through the VA.gov site together. As you do, if you can think out loud, that would be very helpful so I can hear how the site works for you.

Please pull up Google or another Internet browser that you use to search for information online. Thank you. Can you now type in www.va.gov?

- I'd like to ask you now to think about a situation where you want to get information about a VA benefit or service in Spanish. Can you show me how you would try to find that on this site? _[examples of follow-up questions depending on where they go: What information is this page providing? Is this the information you expected to find here? If you didn't find what you needed here, what would you do next? Why?]_

_[If the participant doesn't go to the footer after a few minutes, direct them to the footer for this next part]_

- _[Before participant clicks on the Spanish link]_ Before you click on the link, can you tell me what you would expect to find on this page? Thank you. Okay, go ahead and click.
- _[On Spanish page: Follow-up questions]_ 
  - What do you see on this page? Is it what you expected?
  - What type of information does the page offer?
  - Can you take a few moments to read the page and tell me more about your thoughts on the information here as you read?
  - What would you do next? Why?
- _[After participant clicks on a link from page]_ What do you see on this page now? Is it what you expected? 

### Things to watch for:

- Where does the participant go to find translated content?
- Does the participant find the Spanish language assistance link in the footer without direction? If yes, how long does it take them to find it?
- Does the participant understand the content on the Spanish language assistance page? Is it helpful to them? Is it confusing? 

## Third Task: Usability test part 2: COVID-19 vaccine page - 15 minutes

Now I'm going to ask you to think about a situation where you want to get information about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

I'd like to ask you to go back to the va.gov homepage. 

Thank you. Now, please find the banner near the top of the page content that offers information about the coronavirus. In that banner, please click on the link labeled "vaccine information page."

_[Once on COVID-19 vaccine page]_

- What do you find on this page? 
- What would you do next?

_[if user doesn't find the Spanish-language link]_ Please now click on the link to read this page in Spanish.

- What do you notice when you get to this Spanish page? Tell me what you think about the page.
- What is the content telling you? Can you describe for me what you're reading in your own words?
- What action would you take next? Do you feel confident that you could take that action based on this information?
- Is there any information you feel like you're missing here?
- If you felt that you needed more help with getting a vaccine, what would you do?
- Would you share this information with another Veteran, family member, or caregiver who needs a COVID-19 vaccine? _[if yes]_ How would you share it?

- Is the content helpful to the participant? How could we improve it?
- Does the participant notice and understand the "(en ingl√©s)" label on links to English pages? How does linking off to English pages impact the participant's experience?

## Fourth Task: Good experience recommendations - 10 minutes

Now that we've taken a look at the current Spanish content experience on VA.gov, I'd like to ask you to share any other websites that you think do a great job with providing Spanish content.

- Can you take me to a website that you think does a great job with Spanish content? 
- _[once on site]_ Can you tell me about why you think this website does a great job?
- Any other sites you'd like to recommend?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Is there anything I didn't ask about that you'd like to share before we end our session today?
- Do you have any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it  works for all Veterans and their family members and caregivers.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
