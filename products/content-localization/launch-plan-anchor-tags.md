# Phase I: moderated staging environment testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

Planning:

- Desired date range or test duration: 30 days
- Desired number of users: 10k
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: Users don't need to be logged in or have a specific profile to use this feature. Therefore, we are going to launch this behind a feature flag and have members of the team test before we roll out to production.
- How you'll conduct the testing: use of flipper feature to test internally and then roll-out at 100% 
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: via socks access or staging.va.gov

Results:

- Number of users: 
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: 
- Types of errors logged: 
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no
- If yes, what: 


# Phase II: Staged Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)


Planning

- Desired date range: 05/03/2021 - 05/31/2021
- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it: n/a
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?: 1.5 CTR for links
- Links to dashboard(s) showing "success criteria" metrics: [link here]


Stage A: Canary

Test a small population of users to make sure any obvious bugs / edge cases are caught.

Planning

Length of time: x (minimum 2 hours)
Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): x% (500 users) (Recommendation: select a percentage that targets ~500 users, or at most 10%)
Results:

Number of unique users: x
Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): x
Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
What UX changes (if any) are necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges?
Stage B: moderate

Test a larger population of users to make sure there are no issues exposed by larger usage patterns.

Planning

Length of time: x (minimum 1 day)
Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): 25% (x users)
Results:

Number of unique users: x
Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): x
Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
What UX changes (if any) are necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges?
More stages? Sure! If it makes sense for your product! Plan them out with the same structure as above.
