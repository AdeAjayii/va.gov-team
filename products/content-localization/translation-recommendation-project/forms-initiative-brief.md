# Initiative Brief â€“ Translated Forms
#### Overview



## Outcome Summary

Extend our ability to provide translated content to on-line form applications.

To date, we have established an approach for supporting static content pages and are working on recommendations for moving to a more scaleable solution. We need to be able to do the same for on-line forms and as a first step, understand the effort and obstacles that need to be solutioned.

## Problem

What is the problem and who is affected? 

Veterans and their family members with limited English proficiency (LEP) don't have access to essential VA online content in their native language.

What evidence do we have of the problem?

VA has existing guidance for complying with Executive Order 13166, Improving Access to Services for Persons with Limited English Proficiency, 65 Fed. 50,121 (Aug. 16, 2000).

(Research study underway for Spanish Veterns/caregiversâ€¦)


* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
VA North Star:
â€¢	Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov site
â€¢	Veterans and their families can apply for benefits online
â€¢	Drive to self service tools and faster times to outcomes
â€¢	(Do we have any numbers on cost savings of applying on-line or reduced time to process applications and get benefits??)

<!--
## Desired User Outcomes
- *Why would a user want to use this?*

On-line applications are more efficient and accurate. Providing translated applications will increase awareness of available benefits and enable Veterans/family members/caregivers to receive their benefits more quickly (proof point?).

(Note: Cindyâ€™s recent research on just the technical challenges with downloading PDFs).

- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

We should see an increase in on-line form applications for xx form from the Spanish speaking population along with a reduction in errors? Quicker time for approvals?


## Undesired User Outcomes
-	VA can't demonstrate progress on translation efforts in a timely way

## Desired Business Outcomes

-	Meet federal/agency requirements for providing translated benefit information.
-	VA demonstrates to Congress that we are continuing to make progress with providing critical information in Spanish while working towards our longer-term approach recommendations
-	VA provides relevant, easy-to-find, high-quality content for LEP Veterans and their families in the languages they most need (Spanish first)


## Undesired Business Outcomes
-	Veterans, family members and caregivers find content confusing or unhelpful.
-	Veterans, family members and caregivers can't easily find or use translated content.


---
## Measuring Success

-	Measure PDF vs on-line form error rates? Approval timeframe? Completion rate?time to complete?
-	We will include a Medallia Spanish survey on translated pages to collect customer feedback. 


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
> ðŸ’¡ *VA.gov products measure success against Ease of use, Service Completion, 
Trust/Satisfaction, Health.*<sup>1</sup>\

- Increased â€¦. TBD
- High satisfaction score via Medallia Spanish survey

## Discovery

There are several considerations in determining which on-line application Form to translate and offer in Spanish:

-	The current on-line application form also has a corresponding English and Spanish PDF version (setting baseline metrics and KPIs)
-	The form is not overly complex/long
-	Evidence of a high need exists
-	Form requires minimal updates/changes
-	Other technical considerations and/or value?

### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks.*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
Spanish LEP Veterans/family members/caregivers value an on-line translated application process for benefits on par with English version
  - .
- **Usability Risks**:
We expect to see a higher completion rate and satisfaction score with this offering
  - .
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks**:
  - . On-line application form is limited to 1 form for launch that maps to the considerations listed above.

- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints**:

This is part of on-going effort to support Congressional request and EO.

Before undertaking this effort, we will have completed technical discoverability for effort including LOE, other system dependencies/constraints, translation service availability and the like to enable us to start with a very high confidence level that we can build and ship this within set timeframe.

We will also gain a better understanding of how to scale translation for Forms from this effort. 

### Prioritization
> *Describe the team's competing solution hypotheses/ideas. Prioritize them accounting for reach, impact/value, effort, and confidence.*

### Solution Scope
> *What's in scope for you to build with this initiative? Describe key features/flows. What have you explicitly decided to **not** include and why?*
