## Section 1: Executive summary (Danielle, Sharon)

## Section 2: Our phased approach to date (Danielle, Adam, Michelle)

- Brief summary/diagram of what we have done to date: (Adam, Michelle)
  -	Screen reader support
  -	Menu Toggle
  - React widget
-	Limitations/risks (not-scaleable, resource intensive etc)
## Section 3: Needs assessment (Danielle, Eunice, Sharon)
- Population statistics (Danielle)

  -	How it would work (with technical diagram/specs) (Michelle, Adam)
  -	Benefits (Michelle, Adam)
  -	Risks, drawbacks, limitations (Michelle, Adam)
  - What it would take to make it happen (Michelle, Adam)
