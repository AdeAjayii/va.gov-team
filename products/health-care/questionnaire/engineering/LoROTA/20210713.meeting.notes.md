Mark Dewey's Notes from the 20210713 meeting

## scratch pad

- whats is the minimal data we need to store in LoROTA
- currently VetText queries LoROTA

- vetxt puts data in lorata
gets UUId
only stores
  appointment id

link to a list of questionnaires

line between check in and clipboard

a clipboard gets a UUID

- arrary if Qid's

if vetext knew the Qid, it could just embed

VeText is going straight to VistA

SiP

- QR responses don't expire
- SiP using Lighthouse?

## Whats the MVP?

- a validation page/flow
- a thing that supports multiple questionnaires
  - a checklist to show use what questionnaires they have
- VeText queries Vista to store data in LoROTA
  - patient ICN
  - appointment id
- Vets API queries LoROTA to get clipboard data

## Questions

- How can we prefetch LoROTA data in a sercure way?
- In complete data in Light house, that might be an issue.
- Do we need demographic data for our questionnaire?
- can we edit the questionnaire?
- Can the questionnaires be required at different times? Ie Mental health needs to be fill out with in aday or pre-visit can be filled out now. (not MVP)
