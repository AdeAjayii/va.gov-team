## Questions

We were chatting about FHIR appointment data, and have a question for the Lighthouse team. For reference we are using [this doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/health-apis-patient-generated-data/blob/API-000-mapping/mapping/appointment.md) as a sample

- How do we know if this a primary care appointment?
- How real is that data? We tried looking up the clinic details and data fields are not lining up.
- For three structures (appointment, organizations, and locations), What are the expected structural variations, For example, what fields will always be there, what fields can be there?
