# Executive Summary
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

## Problem Statement
As a Veteran, Iâ€™m unable to easily and quickly provide pre and post visit documentation in a digital and discrete format that can be shared across facilities and my care team.
