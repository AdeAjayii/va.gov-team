### Participant Summary
- 3 Male, 1 Female
- 3 Veterans, 1 Caregiver
- Appt. Types
  - 4 Primary Care (Annual Visit), 6 Speciality, Followups (labs)

### Unmet Needs
- Only enter/provide the things that have changed
- Provide updates/information in their own time
	- >  “I’d like an email before an appointment so I could do it at home and I don't have to scramble”.
- On time appts and not waiting so long to see Dr.
	- > “I would do them ahead of time so the appts can be on time. I think if
 the information is already there and I fill it out a day or two ahead,
 then the dr. would have it right there and maybe they wouldn't run
 behind all the time..."

- Workflow consistency and seamless next steps
	- > “The way I do everything in MyHealtheVet” “much easier that way”
 “That makes it so much easier. Not having to handover IDs ...its contactless which is a blessing at this time” _Kiosk use_

- Understand complicated medical terms 
	- > “allot of big words and phrases that some people might not understand"


### Barriers
- Access (authorization) to MyHealtheVet due to requirement to verifying identity in a clinic before a Veteran can access their patient portal and can review the most up to date medical records information. 
- Going to a VA clinic annualy is a checkbox for VA Benefits and Free Rx, therefore, the Veteran is not as engaged and motivated to prepare for the visit and discusssion. 

### Moments that Matter
- **Waiting Room** - Long wait in the waiting room before seeing their Dr.
	- > "I'll do anything to speed up the process so I won't be at the VA all day"

- **During the Visit** - Dr. and Veteran discussion with information provided to Nurse minutes before

	- > “I think they fall in to a big black hole and never to be seen again”

- **Know What Matters** - Dr. has information provided by Veteran for what they want to focus on in the visit
	- > “... the dr. would have it right there….they could see the information and know what to focus on.”
- **Transitions of Care** - Dr. to Dr. seamless transition of care
	-  > “So I don’t have to go through it over and over and over again”
	
	
### Incorrect Assumptions
- Veterans are not being asked to fill out pre-visit or post-visit information.
	- All is verbial with nurse and repeated to physician.
	- Typically - only asked Social History ~10 quesiotns.   ie. Pain, Depression, Falls, Substansce Use.
	- Typically - Nurse/Dr. are not reviewing and confirming past medical hisotory is up to date.
