The goals of this study were to: 

## Research Methodology 

We conducted 30-45 minute remote interviews with Veterans and Caregivers via Zoom. 

### Who we talked to

- 7 Veterans
- 1 Caregiver
- Representative of ages 25 to 75+

## Key Findings

1. Filling out forms is not a pain point if Veterans believe the information will benefit the care they receive.
2. Veterans believe that filling out digital forms would decrease wait times and optimize time with care providers.
3. The biggest pain point for Veterans is the handoff of information.
4. Currently, Veterans are not asked to fill out many forms aside from initial intake and specialty care.
5. Veterans who receive care from civilian and Non-VA providers are used to digitally filling out pre-visit forms.
6. Participants want a way to connect digital forms with their information in MyhealtheVet.
7. Veterans must scheduled one primary care appointment per year in order to retain VA Healthcare eligibility.
8. Veterans want a way to track their routine responses over time.

## Details of Findings

**Filling out forms is not a pain point if Veterans believe the information will benefit the care they receive.** Veterans did not see forms/questionnaires as a major pain point, but did acknowledge the frustrations around providing information that their providers do not read before a visit. Additionally, Veterans found value in the social history questions (oral, not currently written or digital) a nurse asks before they see a provider.

 - Assumption: Nurses ask these questions orally and input or edit information themselves because it is quicker than having the Veteran fill out a form during their visit.
 
- Assumption: Providers review a patient's documentation before or during a visit, which can be frustrating for new patients. This may not be a pain point for patients wo have seen the same provider for years. 

> "If patients are being asked to provide the information then it should be usedâ€¦ and becomes the basis for the discussion with the provider."
