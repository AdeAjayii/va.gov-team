# Research Plan for Health Care Questionnaires Team June 2020 
## Goals	
This research is for initial discovery for the Health Care Experience, Questionnaires team. 

**Background**

Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre-appointment experiences for veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing veterans with a digital option to complete pre-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

The problem: Veterans need a way to digitally fill out intake forms when preparing for appointments/visits so that they can save time before seeing a doctor.

**Research questions**
  - What are some current problems/pain points Veterans face when filling out information before visits?
  - Who are Veterans interacting with when they are filling out documents? (clinicians, docs, etc.)
  - What role do Caregivers have in relation to certain forms?
  - Which forms are the highest priority for Veterans?
  - How do these forms fit into the Veteran health journey?
  - Is the context always pre-visit? If no, what types of forms would exist post-visit?
  - How can we clearly name this team/product?
  
**Hypothesis**
- TBD

## Method	
We will conduct remote interviews via Zoom using the Perigean contract.This method will allow us to understand various problems and bright spots Veterans and Caregivers currently face when preparing for doctor's visits. It will also help us understand which forms to prioritize as we determine the scope for our tool.
