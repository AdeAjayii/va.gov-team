# Research Plan for Health Care Questionnaires Team June 2020 
## Goals	
This research is for initial discovery for the Health Care Experience, Questionnaires team. 

**Background**

Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre-appointment experiences for veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing veterans with a digital option to complete pre-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

The problem: As a Veteran, I’m unable to easily and quickly provide pre and post visit documentation in a digital and discrete format that can be shared across facilities and my care team, so that they can save time before seeing a doctor.

**Research questions**
  - What are some current problems/pain points Veterans face when filling out information before visits?
  - Who are Veterans interacting with when they are filling out documents? (clinicians, docs, etc.)
  - What role do Caregivers have in relation to certain forms?
  - Which forms are the highest priority for Veterans?
  - How do these forms fit into the Veteran health journey?
  - Is the context always pre-visit? If no, what types of forms would exist post-visit?
  - How can we clearly name this team/product?
  
**Hypothesis**
- Caregivers will have a unique experience related to assisting filling out forms for Veterans
- Veterans may struggle to write legibly on a printed form so the care team can read during the visit
- Veterans may not understand that all their paper documentation is not transcribed into their chart and reviewed by their care team at subsequent visits.
- Veterans may have concerns about using pen, paper, clipboard that may have not been cleaned before their use 
- Veterans may want to print out the intake form and bring with them to their visit to discuss with their care team
- Veterans may miss completing the mailed version of the printed intake form and completing before their visit
- Veterans may not understand that their health records may have different results/updates as they use multiple VA and community care centers.
- Veterans may not understand that they can use their personal devices to complete pre-visit documentation on their own time
- Veterans may not know how long it will take them before a visit to fill out the forms and not arrive in enough time
- Veterans may not know they can update their medical history to inform their care team of current status. ie. Medications and Allergies.


## Method	
We will conduct remote interviews via Zoom using the Perigean contract.This method will allow us to understand various problems and bright spots Veterans and Caregivers currently face when preparing for doctor's visits. It will also help us understand which forms to prioritize as we determine the scope for our tool.

## Participants and Recruitment	
We would like to talk with 10 participants:
- At least one Caregiver
- At least 3 women
- Had an appointment at a VAMC in the last six months
- Has received primary or specialty care in the last year
- At least 3 participants between ages 24-40
- At least 1 with a Section 508 disability _(Review with Jennifer Strickland)_
