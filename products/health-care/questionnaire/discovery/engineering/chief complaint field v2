# Putting Chief Complaint field into VistA

## Chief Complaint Field

#### Using FHIR Questionnaire/VAMF into PGD

- The best approach currently to investigate is to write to PGD using VAMF and a proxy. The proxy is needed to write data on behalf of a veteran
- PGD is FHIR based, which means that you can not just add fields but have to use the definitions in FHIR.
