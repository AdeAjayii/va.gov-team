# Knowns
- Location of past [Rx Refill research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/vets-prescriptions)
- All the ways that a Veteran can refill their prescription as of 8/9/2017. 
   - This might help us think through all the medication touchpoints that currently exist and see if there is any impact on our feature.
- An old MyHealthyVet wireframe of [Rx refill](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/vets-prescriptions/research/mhv-prototype/redesign-prototype-pharmacy-1.pdf), but they also envisioned letting Vets add medications. Therefore, it looks more like a complete meds list.
  - They were envisioning pictures of medications.
