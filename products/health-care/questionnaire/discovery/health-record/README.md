## Medications
- Location of past [Rx Refill research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/vets-prescriptions)
- The following was validated through previous [user research as medication information of interest](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/mhv-api/2016-06-03-technical-validation.md)/ previous [medication feature or information asks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/mhv-api/missing-data-that-we-need.md):
  - self-entered data
  - medication instructions
  - facility details (locations and phone number)
  - start/stop dates
  - side effects
  - warnings
  - drug interactions
  - trade name (there was a note that they were looking into if they really needed this)
  - dose/frequency
  - pharmacy phone
  - provider
  - contact my pharmacy/provider (they planned a connect to secure messaging here)
  - doctor/ specialist who prescribed each medication
- All the ways that a Veteran can [refill their prescription as of 8/9/2017](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/vets-prescriptions/research/ways-to-refill-rx-at-va.md). 
   - This might help us think through all the medication touchpoints that currently exist and see if there is any impact on our feature. Will need updated.
- An old MyHealthyVet wireframe of [Rx refill](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/vets-prescriptions/research/mhv-prototype/redesign-prototype-pharmacy-1.pdf), but they also envisioned letting Vets add medications. Therefore, it looks more like a complete meds list.
  - They were envisioning pictures of medications.
- [Personas identified for Rx refills](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/vets-prescriptions/research/high-level-userflow.md) (could these be applied to updating med list in questionnaire)
