# Questions we have
- Are we connecting to sure scripts list (BPMH) or just VA med list?
  - In EHR, name, dose and timing are separate items, in sure scripts it is one piece of data
- If we donâ€™t have renewing medications in a questionnaire, how do we stop Veterans from asking about that?
- What currently is available in Lighthouse?
- Are we missing any past user research?
- What if we think of this as something has changed and not just a meds list?
- What special can we do, since this is a payer/provider system?
# Knowns
## Medications
- [Past Rx Refill research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/vets-prescriptions)
- Feature ideas from [past user research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/mhv-api/2016-06-03-technical-validation.md)/ [previous data asks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/mhv-api/missing-data-that-we-need.md)/ shown in old wireframes [set 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/mhv-api/doc-images/detail.png) and [set 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/vets-prescriptions/research/mhv-prototype/redesign-prototype-pharmacy-1.pdf)/ our team's ideas:
  - photos of the pills
  - self-entered data
  - medication instructions
  - facility details (locations and phone number)
  - start/stop dates (could it be shown as a timeline)
  - side effects
  - warnings
  - drug interactions
  - trade name (there was a note that they were looking into if they really needed this)
  - dose/frequency
  - pharmacy phone
  - provider
  - contact my pharmacy/provider (they planned a connect to secure messaging here. There is also a VA app "Ask a Pharmacist")
  - doctor/ specialist who prescribed each medication
  - refill information (status - active, expired, discontinued, number remaining and refillable date)
  - medication type (such as VA prescription)
  - What diagnosis is this addressing or helping with? Why am I taking this? Review by condition?
  - Connection to formulary
- All the ways that a Veteran can [refill their prescription as of 8/9/2017](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/vets-prescriptions/research/ways-to-refill-rx-at-va.md). 
   - This might help us think through all the medication touchpoints that currently exist and see if there is any impact on our feature. Will need updated.
  - They were envisioning pictures of medications.
- [Personas identified for Rx refills](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/vets-prescriptions/research/high-level-userflow.md) (could these be applied to updating med list in questionnaire)
- Some MHV analytics ([from 2016 report though](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/vets-prescriptions/research/rx-refills-discovery-final-deck.pptx))
  - Within Prescriptions, the Refill Prescription page accounts for nearly 80% of traffic. The remaining traffic goes to prescription tracking (2.1%), prescription history (11%) and Meds, OTCs, Herbs & Supplements (0.3%)
- [Old design inspirations](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/prescription-refills/vets-prescriptions/research/inspiration.md) (from around 2016)
