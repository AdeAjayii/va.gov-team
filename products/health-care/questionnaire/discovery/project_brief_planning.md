# Discovery Project Brief & Planning

This doc should be filled out during different stages of the discovery sprint process. See the [Discovery Sprint How-to](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) for details on the whole process.

## PROJECT BRIEF

There is information that could be gathered from veterans more efficiently and safely) but need to learn a lot more about what that generic problem looks like in different contexts (e.g. in-person vs. online; within the peculiarities of different VA facilities and workflows. We also need to learn a lot more about the existing tools that address the problem and adjacent problems.

### Project Name
Healthcare Experience - Questionnaires (TBD)

### Problem Statement / How Might We statements
How might we improve the in-person and online pre-appointment experiences for veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing veterans with a digital option to complete pre-appointment questionnaires and screeners?

## DISCOVERY PLANNING

### Project Details

-   Primary users: Veterans and/or their caregivers; employees in veteran-facing business lines that need to gather information from veterans and/or their caregivers in advance of a in-person or online appointment.
    
-   Goals of Primary user (assumptions- until research)
    

	-   A veteran has the opportunity to complete screening questions prior to their in-person or online appointment;
    
	-   Veterans are able to limit the amount of time they need to spend in the lobby/waiting area in the physical proximity of others;
    
	-   Veterans spend less time filling out questionnaires and screeners;
    
	-   Veterans complete questionnaires and screeners at a higher rate, with higher accuracy when compared to current methods (e.g. paper, iPads);
    
	-   Veteran-facing employees spend less time transferring veteran-provided data from one medium (paper, iPads) to the canonical veteran record;
    

-   Aligned VA Personas and Journey Maps.
    

	-   Will be identified during pre and discovery sprints.
    

-   Business Goals:
    

	-   Support physical distancing efforts in VA facilities
    
	-   Reduce concurrent visitor loads in VA facilities by reducing the number of tasks a veteran must to complete within the facility
    
	-   Reduce concurrent online appointment loads by reducing the number of tasks a veteran must complete during an online appointment
    
	-   Improve employee productivity by reducing the effort needed to integrate veteran-provided data into canonical sources
    
-   Align to Business North Star
    

	- Increase availability of self-service tools
    

		- At a minimum, we will make the existing tool more widely available in a self-service manner as the current on-premise eScreening applications are completed by Veterans on a VA iPad in the facility and on the VA network.
    

	-   Decrease time to outcomes
    

		-   Make a pre-appointment tool available for online appointments means less appointment time is taken up by answering standardized questions, potentially reducing appointment times and/or increasing the efficacy of those appointments.
    

	-   Maximize satisfaction, reliability, availability, & security
    

		-   At a minimum, bringing the existing tools into the VA.gov family will make them much more widely available across multiple channels (online via internet; kiosks in facilities).
    

-   Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?
    

	-   All user goals and business goals are assumptions at this point and should be verified with Stakeholder and User Research sessions conducted during the pre-discovery and discovery sprints and reoccurring thought design and development of the product.
    
	-   See [Discovery Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/discovery/user-research)
    

-   How are we going to find out answers?
    

	-   Current State Workflows provided by different clinical facilities
    

	-   pdf forms used today - multiple locations for customizations
    
	-   workflow diagrams for process of completing a form by veteran to review by a clinician and storage for record
    

	-   Stakeholders and Aligned Products Discovery Sessions to see if/when forms interact with their workflows.
    

-   What secondary research should we do (google, facebook, internal documents)?
    

	-   The team will be provided Market Research “suggestion” during Discovery kickoff and ask to review and find others from their own research.
    
	-   Who is awesome in this space and why?
    

		-   All the VA apps in progress
    

			-   ie. VetLink, Connect Care Rx App, MyHealtheVet pt. Generated database, Connect Care - Family Health History Survey...etc.

-   Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?
    

	-   None at this time
    

-   Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?
    

	-   Lack of and/or reluctance of standardization across VA facilities for pre-appointment data collection processes and norms
    
	-   How do we conduct in-person research (e.g. job shadowing) in the new covid reality?
    
	-   We’ve mostly magic’d this effort up on our own, so possibly of “who told you to do this?” and other questions as to our authority
    
	-   Integration with EHR systems at VistA vs. Cerner sites
    

	-   With the current long term transition in EMR’s the bi-directional API/interfaces will need to be from multiple sources (who holds the source of truth for current forms data?
    

	-   Access to current state workflows early in pre-discovery to prepare for stakeholder interviews
    
	-   Stakeholder interviews early in pre-discover to prepare knowledgeable user research.
    
	-   Many other VA products have been created using a form to capture veteran data and understanding which solutions will overlap or need to work together to create an intuitive transition when a veteran is using both products.
    
	-   Can we align our roadmap to other aligned products to integrate in their workflow (ie. they will need to make enhancements to their solution)
    

	-   Notifications to let the veteran know they have a clipboard
    
	-   Scheduling a visit will trigger a clipboard to be sent
    
	-   Authenticated and unauthenticated va.go home pages. To advertise or let the veteran know they have completed or to do forms.
    
	-   Many more to be identified during discovery...
    

-   What don't we know?
    

	-   What types of forms we are targeting
    
	-   What encounter types are we targeting
    
	-   What technology platform are we using. Ie. va.gov, kiosk, native app, web responsive app, .etc
    
	-   What data will be available for integration into EHR and the form
    

### Timeline

-   Are there any hard and fast deadlines for completing the discovery work?
    

	-   None - however will target a 2 week Pre-discovery followed by a 2 week Discovery sprint.
    

-   When will the following take place?
    

	-   Discovery Prep: sprint 23 - 06/03/2020 - 06/16/2020
    

	-   Discovery Kick off - 06/04/2020
    

	-   Discovery (ideally 1-2 weeks): sprint 24 06/17/2020 - 06/30/2020
    
	-   User Research - targeting sprint 24 06/17/2020; but will move up in pre-discovery if the research plan is ready.
    
	-   Complete & Readout: 06/30 or 7/01
