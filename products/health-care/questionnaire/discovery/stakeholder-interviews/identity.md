 Melissa is leading efforts on: 

**Goal is to make an overall VA identity strategy.**

 - ID proofing pilot with the Veteran Identification Card (VIC) team, 
	 - Proofing validating who you are- only certain products need this level of security 
	 - Access pilot todate
	 - FedRamp- which items require. 
 - Identity verification pilots with DOD DMDC ([login.gov](http://login.gov/) as an alternative to DS Logon, milconnect, eBen, MHS genesis)  
 -  Platform overall identity strategy-partner with IDme. 
**Current Identity**
- IDme- currently production- anyone doing access VA (search)
- DSLogoin- DOD idea to give all service member unique login and veterans who don't have a login. goes down allot. Fraud related issues. Just authentication IDMe for proofing
-  Myhealthevet- in-house VA built authentication. seems fine and why do we have multiple login.
- ViC pilot -veterans ID card pilot. will be dependent on user count as there is a limit.
- Login.gov and IDme that provide both identity authentication and proofing.
- login sandbox - we could play with the solution or just go to the sites and create new accounts for testing. 
- access va- standard -

1. What do you need from our team to put our workflow behind an identity? 
	 - If using va.gov we should just get the features if we plug into the API. If creating our own solution the team will publish standards and best practices for other teams that have implemented and potentially use their solution. 

 2. We will likely have an unauthenticated workflow and when more information is needed pull in the login? 
	  - Not sure this is being done todate. Melissa will send a tech resource name who can tell if we have capability to - save progress from unauth to auth. 
 3. If we build native mobile app is your identity web responsive for mobile - any considerations we need to be aware of? 
	 - future concept of native apps but not there yet just pilots. We should explore workflow of launching in app browser to authenticate on va.gov is we build a native mobile wrapper for our workflow.  This is a platform feature so not likely to be our work. Will need to stay on va.gov until a mobile app framework is built. 
	 - Touch/FaceID authentication? for mobile? IL1 -identification IL2 proofing IL3 - biometric (this is not done todate and is on roadmap) 
 4. Does the identity pass any identifiers to the source system? 
	 - 	HIPPA compliant? 	yes with the identifiers to-date 
 5. Where is the identity calling the person profile from?
	 - Need tech resource to go into provide linkage and fields.  Melissa will send over links to their project folders
