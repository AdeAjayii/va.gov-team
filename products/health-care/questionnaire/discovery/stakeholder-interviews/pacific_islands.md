### Questions

 1. Can you tell us a little bit about your backround & how you ended up in your current role at VA? 
 2. What does the current check in process look like for your team now? 
 3. Are there any folks that work directl on the intake/admin side who we can talk to to learn a bit more about this process?  
 4. I haven't gotten much intel from Shane on your conversations, so I'm wondering if you can share with our team what the two of you talked about/what you're looking to build for Hawaii? 
 5. What is your blue sky, anything is possible vision for this check in process?
 6. I know you've talked to Shane a bit already about the COVID screener and eScreener--what are some features/aspects of those tools that sounded appealing to you and your current needs?
