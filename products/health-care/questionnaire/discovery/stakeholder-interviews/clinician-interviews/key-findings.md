## Research Goals 

The goals of this study were to:
- Understand the clinician side of the Veteran health journey
- Learn what areas/forms/questions to prioritize 
- Learn more about the pre-appointment questionnaire and process 

### Who we talked to

- Dr. Bryne, Loma Linda
- VA Pacific Islands Health Care System
- Sharon Tapia 

## Key Findings

1. Clinicans want ahead-of-time insight into the reason for a Veteran's visit so that they can provide the appropriate care.
2. There is a need for a "face sheet" or one-page summary of a Veteran's health information to refer to during a visit.
3. It would be beneficial to clinicians for Veterans to fill out some Clinical Reminders ahead of their appointment.
4. Cliniciant want to an up-to-date list of the medications a Veteran is taking and/or needs refilled.

## Details of Findings

**Clinicans want ahead-of-time insight into the reason for a Veteran's visit so that they can provide the appropriate care.**
- Unable to prepare for Veteran visit due to non-specific visit reason/chief complaint
- Unknown major life events or stressors affecting the Veteran
- Unknown Acute and Chronic problems affecting the Veteran

**There is a need for a "face sheet" or one-page summary of a Veteran's health information to refer to during a visit.** This information informs the type of care a provider gives to a Veteran.

**It would be beneficial to clinicians for Veterans to fill out some Clinical Reminders ahead of their appointment.** Though some questions may need to be asked orally during an appointment depending on their risk-factor, clinicans expressed a desire to have some clinical reminder questions filled out earlier to save time.
