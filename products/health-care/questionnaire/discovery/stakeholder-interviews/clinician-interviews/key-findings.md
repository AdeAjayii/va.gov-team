## Research Goals 

The goals of this study were to:
- Understand the clinician side of the Veteran health journey

## Key Findings

1. Clinicans want ahead-of-time insight into the reason for a Veteran's visit.

3. It would be beneficial to clinicians for Veterans to fill out some Clinical Reminders ahead of their appointment.

## Details of Findings

**Clinicans want ahead-of-time insight into the reason for a Veteran's visit.**

**There is a need for a "face sheet" or one-page summary of a Veteran's health information to refer to during a visit.** This information informs the type of care a provider gives to a Veteran.

**It would be beneficial to clinicians for Veterans to fill out some Clinical Reminders ahead of their appointment.** Though some questions may need to be asked orally during an appointment depending on their risk-factor, clinicans expressed a desire to have some clinical reminder questions filled out earlier to save time.
