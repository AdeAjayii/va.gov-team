## Sync w/the VA Pacific Islands Health Care System

- Thursday, July 2⋅3:30 – 4:30pm
- Dr. Byrne is Internal Medicine and Informatics physician form Loma Linda.  We have been working together on clinical applications for > 20 years.  He is the clinical lead on the After Visit Summary (AVS).  It is an application that was originally developed to provide a patient with a summary of their visit but he and Rob Durkin expanded it to a pre-visit questionnaire (an example is attached) and a screenshot of the app is below.  He would be another excellent resource to get information related to your new project.
