## Sync w/the VA Pacific Islands Health Care System

- Thursday, July 2⋅3:30 – 4:30pm
- Dr. Byrne is Internal Medicine and Informatics physician form Loma Linda.  We have been working together on clinical applications for > 20 years.  He is the clinical lead on the After Visit Summary (AVS).  It is an application that was originally developed to provide a patient with a summary of their visit but he and Rob Durkin expanded it to a pre-visit questionnaire (an example is attached) and a screenshot of the app is below.  He would be another excellent resource to get information related to your new project.

### Meeting Questions: 

 1. Was the pre-visit form different based on the type of visit the Veteran was coming in for? 
	 - If not, was that something that could have been enhanced?
	 - Typically there is a limit to the # of topics per visit due to time was that something the providers wanted to state on the form?
 2. Was the form printed by the admin and handed to Veteran or was this sent in mail/email ahead of appt?
	 -  if so when?
3. Health Reminders on the form...was the Veteran to do anything or was this there so they could have a discussion about the recommendations and book appts if needed? (ie. did the provider/nurse go over them during the visit)
4. Fields included in the form 
	 - Appt Date /Time/Location
	 - Reason for Visit - In Veterans words what are they wanting the provider to focus on
		 - Examples- medications, tests, diagnoses, referral, other
	 - Health Reminders (Health Maintenance) 
		 - list of reminders for the patient- this is pre-populating based in the patients chart
	- Did it include health history?
	- Were there fields that you were unable to pull in to the form to pre-populate?
	- Where there other fields the admin/nurse/dr wanted pulled in the form?
	-  Others?? 
5. Was the form scanned in and saved to the patient chart?  
	- if so did that happen before seeing the dr./nurse or after the visit?
	- was any of the information input into the patient chart or just left as a document?
6. Sections the Veterans didn't understand or had a hard time completing?
