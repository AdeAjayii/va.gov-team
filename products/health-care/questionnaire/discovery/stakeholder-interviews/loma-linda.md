## Sync w/Dr. Byrne

- Thursday, July 2⋅3:30 – 4:30pm
- Dr. Byrne is Internal Medicine and Informatics physician form Loma Linda.  We have been working together on clinical applications for > 20 years.  He is the clinical lead on the After Visit Summary (AVS).  It is an application that was originally developed to provide a patient with a summary of their visit but he and Rob Durkin expanded it to a pre-visit questionnaire (an example is attached) and a screenshot of the app is below.  He would be another excellent resource to get information related to your new project.

		- evolved into a pre-visit summary
2.  What were some of the driving forces behind the pre-visit questionnaire & AVS products?
	 -	Main reason - Medication rec before hand. sections can be turned on off in admin function

	 -	paper and process usage that make it cumbersome

    -   If not, was that something that could have been enhanced?
	    - It is linked to the specific visit has visit name /info
		    - sees 3 clinics in 1 day or 1 AVS a way to combined 1 for the end of day.
		    - even in specialty they were the same fields.???
    -   Typically there is a limit to the # of topics per visit due to time was that something the providers wanted to state on the form?
	    - It would be nice to list and priorities for the time, but not the norm they are listing a bunch
	    -  better way to capture their main priorities. that we haven't expanded. 
	    -  half an hour for a return visit
	   
4.  Was the form printed by the admin and handed to Veteran or was this sent in mail/email ahead of appt?  if so when? 
  
    - given to Vet by the clerk or nurse they could check off what they are currently taking
5.  Was the form scanned in and saved to the patient chart?
    -   if so did that happen before seeing the dr./nurse or after the visit?
    -   was any of the information input into the patient chart or just left as a document?
	    - upload-pre-visit med list in note due to performance measure
		- once printed it uploads into CPRS as a note.
		- or they can manually upload a PDF into vista 
		- AVS uploads into vista imaging.
6.  Health Reminders on the form...was the Veteran to do anything or was this there so they could have a discussion about the recommendations and book appts if needed? (ie. did the provider/nurse go over them during the visit)
