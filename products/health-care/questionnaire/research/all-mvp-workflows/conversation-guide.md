All mobile. 8 fulfilled participants (maybe 12?)
Had a medical appointment at the VA in the last 6 months.

Warm-up question
Think about your last primary care provider visit at the VA. 	- Did your appointment experience differ at all from past experiences due to COVID? If so, how? 	- What was the experience prior to the appointment like? For example, did you have to fill out any forms before the appointment? Did the nurse ask you a lot of questions?

Questionnaire Scenarios
Keep that pre-appointment experience in mind through the next series of scenarios that we are going to discuss.

Rotate the order in which participants are presented the following scenarios. Participant 1: 1 (email), 2a, then2b.
Participant 2: 2b, 2a, then 1 (text). Etc.

Scenario 1: Send half email example and send half a text example. Don’t click on anything yet. Just read the notification. 
	- What are your impressions of this notification?
	- Why do you believe that you would have been sent this notification?
	- How many days in advance of your appointment would you want to receive this notification?
	- Would you be interested in receiving this notification multiple times? 
		- yes, two reminders are good.
		- only if you didn’t respond to the first notification.
	- What are the actions that you could take immediately based upon the [email or text] that you just received?
 Now, please fill out the questionnaire that your provider has requested you complete. For this questionnaire, your name will be Hector Allen and you have an upcoming primary care appointment for your annual physical. 
	- Things to watch/listen fo: 	 	•	Did the Veteran successfully complete the task. Success = getting to the screen with the "Your questionnaire has been sent to your provider." alert box.
	•	Pay attention to Veteran commentary on confusing or pleasing portions of the task. 	•	Take note of anything the Veteran suggests to add.

	Next, we are going to go back to the beginning of the questionnaire, so I can ask a few questions about each page.
		On the Introduction page, take some time now to review this page.
		- What are your impressions of this page?
		- What are your thoughts about the information provided?
		- Is there any other information we should include here?

		(Only ask this if participant hasn’t completed Scenario 2a yet) On the confirmation page, 
		- What are your impressions of this page?
		- Which of the buttons on the page would you most likely be interested in viewing next? Would you prefer to navigate anywhere else instead?

		(Only ask this if participant hasn’t completed Scenario 2b yet) Click on the “View and print questions” button, what are your impressions of this PDF?
		- Ask Amanda what questions she had about the demo banner and we can ask here.
		- When (if at all) would you view this PDF? When (if at all) would you print this PDF?
		- Would you want any additional information added to this PDF?



Scenario 2:  Find questionnaires that your VA providers have requested you to complete about your health. (Start them on the va.gov homepage…if they get stuck, then direct them to the menu. Stop the participant when they get to the Drupal/marketing page.)
	- Note where they think this feature should exist.
	- How easy or hard was it to find your health questionnaires?

	- When on the marketing/Drupal page…
		- What are your impressions of this page?
		- What are your thoughts about the information provided?
		- How valuable is the information on this page to you?
		- Is there any other information that we should include on this page?

	Scenario 2a: 
	You (in the prototype, your name will be Hector Allen) were sent a questionnaire to complete for your upcoming appointment with your primary care provider on January 4, 2021. You started to fill it out, but you didn’t complete it. Find the questionnaire and finish filling it out. 		- Things to watch/listen fo: 	 		•	Did the Veteran successfully complete the task. Success = getting to the screen with the "Your questionnaire has been sent to your provider." alert box.
		•	Pay attention to Veteran commentary on confusing or pleasing portions of the task. 		•	Take note of anything the Veteran suggests to add.
		- How easy or hard was it to find the in-progress questionnaire? 		- Do we need to know anything else about in-progress beyond…can they find it?

		(Only ask this if participant hasn’t completed Scenario 1 yet) On the confirmation page, 
		- What are your impressions of this page?
		- Which of the buttons on the page would you most likely be interested in viewing next? Would you prefer to navigate anywhere else instead?

	Scenario 2b:  	Your provider just sent you a pre-visit questionnaire. Before you fill it out, you want to review your responses to your last questionnaire. Find your last questionnaire and review your responses.
	- Things to watch/listen fo: 	 		•	Did the Veteran successfully complete the task. Success = click on the “View and print questions.”
		•	Pay attention to Veteran commentary on confusing or pleasing portions of the task. 		•	Take note of anything the Veteran suggests to add.

  		(Only ask this if the participant hasn’t completed Scenario 1 yet) Click on the “View and print questions” button, what are your impressions of this PDF?
		- Ask Amanda what questions she had about the demo banner and we can ask here.
		- When (if at all) would you view this PDF? When (if at all) would you print this PDF?
