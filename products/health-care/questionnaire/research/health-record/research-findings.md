## Background and Goals

### Background
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners. 
Our next phase will focus on improving the pre-appointment experience when visiting primary care providers by allowing Veterans to update their health record information, particularly medications, allergies, and immunizations.

### Research Goals
This research is to explore:
- problems Veterans face when communicating health record (medications, allergies, and immunizations) changes to their VA providers.
- how Veterans understand, group, and find value in reviewing and updating their medications, allergies, and immunizations within a health questionnaire prior to a primary care appointment.
_But we really structured the test to broadly cover the topic of medications, allergies, and immunizations in the beginning. It was only toward the end that we brought up the idea of questionnaires._"

### Hypotheses to be tested
- Adding the ability to view and update medications, allergies, and immunizations within the questionnaire help solve some of the Veteran's current pain points.
- Veterans will be confused by certain medication, allergy, and immunization information. This test should help identify commonly confusing items, so we can address that confusion.
- A pattern will emerge from the Veteran's groups, so the team will understand Veteran's mental model. This mental model could then be replicated in the workflow/interface.
- Veterans will find value in a subset, but probably not all possible data points and proposed features. This will help the team determine scope for this phase.

## Methodology

### Method
We conducted 7 remote moderated tests via Zoom using the Perigean contract. To start, the Veterans will be asked a series of interview questions to uncover current pain points and workflow. Then, participants will engage in a participatory design activity utilizing Mural. This activity should assist with:
- identifying confusing health record terms/data points.
- developing a mental model on how Veteran group health record information.
- identifying value of data points and proposed features.

### Who we spoke with: 7 Veterans

- One participant was completely blind as well.

**In order to qualify for the study, all participants had to:**
- currently be taking at least one medication, 
- have at least one allergy, and
- have had an immunization within the past two years.

**We also specifically recruited for a portion of participants, who:**
- receive some medical care outsides of the VA (5 participants), and
  - Care outside the VA:
    - 5 participants saw the VA or community partners for most of their care. 
    - 1 participant sees the VA for 50% of their care
    - 1 participant didn’t go to the VA at all
- received their immunization at a facility outside the VA (3 participants).

### Research questions: Wrap-up
- How much of your medical care do you receive from the VA? (A great deal/All, Quite a bit, Somewhat, Very little, or None at all)
- How do you keep track of your medications, immunizations, and allergies?
  - What do you like about your current process?
  - What is frustrating about keeping track of your medications?
- How do you keep your VA providers up-to-date on your medications? For instance, maybe you stopped taking a medication or you were prescribed a new medication from a non-VA provider, how did you let your VA providers know?
  - How did the process of communicating those changes to the VA go?
  - If you take any supplements, vitamins, or over-the-counter medications, do you share that with your VA providers?
    - If yes, how did those experiences of letting your VA provider go? What methods did you utilize to communicate the change?
- Have you ever let your VA provider know about any changes to your allergy history?
  - If yes, how did those experiences of letting your VA provider go? What methods did you utilize to communicate the change?
- Have you ever received an immunization at a non-VA facility, maybe a non-VA provider's office or a pharmacy?
  - If yes, how did you let your VA provider know about those immunizations? How did those experiences of letting your VA provider go? What methods did you utilize to communicate the change?
- Do you get a flu shot every year? If so, where? If non-VA location, do they tell their VA provider? If not, why not?
- Have they gotten their COVID vaccine? If yes, was it at a VA facility? If no, are they planning on getting the vaccine and where do they plan on getting it?
  - If they got their COVID vaccine, how was their overall experience?
- _Only ask if necessary, depending upon how the Veteran answered the past three questions, if they didn't talk about their actual appointments with their providers._ How do you prepare for your appointment when you have changes you would like to discuss with your VA provider?
  - Observers: Take note if anyone mentions printing.
- Do you utilize MyHealtheVet?
  - If yes,
    - Have you ever checked your medication list on there?
    - Were those list easy or hard to understand? If hard, what did you find challenging?
    - Have you ever utilized secure message to notify your VA provider of medication, allergy, or immunization changes?
- How can we make it easier for you to communicate to your VA providers?

### Research questions: Mural activity
- This activity will help prioritize and group information that we could display online in medication, allergy, and immunization sections.
  - Observers: Take note of what pieces of data or features the Veteran doesn't understand. Also, note the reasons why the Veteran ranked and grouped things a certain way.
- Immunizations
  - I'm going to show you a bunch information that we could display on va.gov for immunizations. We are going to review them one-by-one. Let me know if you don't understand the item, then I'm going to have you rank them by how valuable they are to see displayed online.
  - Is there anything that should be added to immunizations that we didn't already review?
  - Now, let's group things together that you believe should be displayed together.
- Repeat for Medications and Allergies.

### Research questions: Wrap-up
- Pretend you developed a new medication allergy, such as a rash when you take penicillin. Would you add that medication allergy on the medication section and/or the allergy section?
- How often do you expect to update each of these sections? Would you want to see these sections in a questionnaire before every VA appointment? Would you want to see these sections once every six months or some other time period?
- If we could only build one of these topics into a pre-visit questionnaire, which one would you prefer? Would you pick medications, allergies, and immunizations? Why?
- Do you think adding these pages to a pre-visit questionnaire will help or not help you explain changes to your medications, allergies, and immunizations to your VA provider? Why?
- Is there anything about medications, allergies, and immunizations that I should know about that I didn't cover today?
- Do you have any final questions for me?
