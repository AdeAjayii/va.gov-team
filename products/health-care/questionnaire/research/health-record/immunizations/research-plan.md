# Research Plan: Health Record (Immunizations), February 2021

## Goals	
This research is to explore what Veterans find valuable about reviewing and updating their immunizations when completing a health questionnaire prior to a primary care appointment.

**Background**<br/>
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners. Our next phase will focus on improving the pre-appointment experience when visiting primary care providers by allowing Veterans to update their health record information, particuarly medications, allergies, and immunizations.

**Research questions**
- What data and features do Veterans find valuable when reviewing and updating their immunizations?
- What current pain points do Veterans experience when communicating their immunization history to their providers?

**Hypothesis & assumptions**
- Adding the ability to view and update immunizations within the questionnaire help solve some of the Veteran's current pain points.
- Veterans will find some of the immunization data and proposed features valuable as well as be able to provide a prioritization between the items. 

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated test via Zoom using the Perigean contract. During the test, participants will complete a card sort via Optimal Sort to help determine prioritization of proposed data and features. They will also engage in a participatory design activity utilizing Mural, in order to again provide some prioritization insight and generative design ideas. Both of these activities, when paired with follow-up questioning about pain points, should allow us to confirm/deny our hypothesis.

## Participants and Recruitment

Recruit for 12 fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:

**Must have for participants**
- Have you visted a primary care provider at the VA in the last year? (pass = yes)
	- If confused by the term "primary care provider," explain that a primary care provider is your main doctor, nurse practitioner, or physicianâ€™s assistant.
- At least one person with an identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI

**Good to have for participants**

**Recruitment requirements**
- All must have a laptop/desktop and be willing to be complete the test on said laptop/desktop

*This study requires participants to screenshare, in order to click through a prototype. It will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.*
