## Project-specific setup and Intro - 10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kristen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to discuss how you communicate medication, allergy, and immunization changes your VA provider. Then, you will be helping us design medication, allergy, and immunization interfaces.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features shown in document.
- [Screen share and walk through this document if necessary](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lo44N4rTBDaHfcsjX6bCV1a--YJSTPXSXnZbywB71J0/edit?usp=sharing)
- Send [Mural link](https://preview.uxpin.com/d3c9bb8ac5052d077234b5e4b2f7749d0bc5200d#/pages/134593965?mode=cvhidm) and have them screenshare it now.


**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble sharing your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"** 

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes
Think about the list of medications that you are currently taking, what your allergies are, and the immunizations that you have received in the past few years (such as flu shots or COVID).
- How do you 


# Mural Activity - 35 minutes

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.
