# Conversation Guide: Health Record (Medications, Allergies, and Immunizations) with VA Providers

Assumption: These are questions for primary care providers, which might need adjusted for other roles.

## Warm-up Questions

- How do patients currently report changes to their allergies, medications, and immunizations to you? This could include a new allergy, medication, or immunization that was diagnosed/prescribed/given outside the VA…maybe even the COVID vaccine. This could also include knowing that a Veteran stopping taking a medication.
- What have you noticed Veterans struggle with when communicating medication, allergy, and immunization changes with you?
  - Are there any types of information that you wish Veterans shared with you more, such as immunizations from outside the VA, supplements or OTCs that they are taking? We are asking, because we heard from Veterans that these are topics that sometimes don’t cross their mind to share with their VA providers. Has that been your experience or has your experience differed?
- If you had a magic wand, what would you want to improve about the process of getting updates to medications, allergies, and immunizations from your patients?
- Can you discuss what you might do differently or be improved in your workflow if you knew a patient had received their COVID vaccine from outside the VA (so that information isn’t in Vista)?

## Mural Activity
- Basically, this is a copy of the [Veteran prioritization activity](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/research/health-record/conversation-guide.md) (minus the grouping portion).
- **Notes for researcher.** This section still needs to be completed. Add in compliance features to the clinician version of the Mural. [Veteran version linked here.](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1612803040285/9ee796589a8531afe6837796feb42a5dfd2e7037) 
  - Compliance is:
    - Medications – Taking as Prescribed, Not Taking as Prescribed, Not Taking, and a Comment field.
      - Need to study if these are really the best questions at getting Veterans into medication compliance. Do we only ask about "Not taking?" Look at other studies on medication compliance and BPMH (Best Possible Medication History).
    - Allergies – Some acknowledgement that all are up to date if a list is provided.  If No list then the option to state. No Known Allergies or None ( in the medical record the clinician has to distinguish between No Confirmed Allergies, and No Known Allergies – ie. Stated from the patient.
    - Immunizations – Im not really sure but I’d assume its something like an acknowledgement that the list all looks correct, and maybe something to say unknown if they are due for an immuniz.  Needs to be verified with SMEs

## Wrap-up Questions
- In the context of a digital pre-visit questionnaire, do you think we are missing anything about immunizations, allergies, and medications? Currently, we are allowing Veterans to edit and add, but should they be able to do anything else?
- Would Veteran entering this information in a questionnaire be helpful or not helpful to you?
- Does your office utilize the pre-visit summary (PVS) product in Vista, which is part of the larger After Visit Summary product?
- Discuss the PVS process with them and ask for feedback.
