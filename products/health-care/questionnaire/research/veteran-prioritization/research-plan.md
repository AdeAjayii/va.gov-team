# Research Plan for Healthcare Experience Team August 2020 
## Goals	
This research is to gain Veteran input on how to prioritize our work and inform an MVP. 

**Background**

Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners.
