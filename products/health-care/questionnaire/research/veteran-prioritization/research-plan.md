# Research Plan for Healthcare Experience Team August 2020 
## Goals	
This research is to gain Veteran input on how to prioritize our work and inform an MVP. 

**Background**
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

**Research questions**
- question

**Hypothesis & assumptions**
- hypothesis 1

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated hybrid card sort exercises via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow us prioritize our existing list of priorities while also learning about new potential areas to explore through Veteran created categories. After the sort, we will share a lo-fidelity mockup to get Veteran feedback.
