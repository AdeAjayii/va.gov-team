# Research Plan for Healthcare Experience Team August 2020 
## Goals	
This research is to gain Veteran input on how to prioritize identified initiatives and inform the MVP. 

**Background**<br>
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

**Research questions**
- What topics/questions would Veterans find useful to answer ahead of an appointment?
- What topics/questions do Veterans find most beneficial to their healthcare experience?
- How do Veteran sorted priorities align with what we have learned from clinicians?

**Hypothesis & assumptions**
- Veterans will rank topics/questions related to their medical history highly
- Veterans will provide feedback on topics/questions not listed in the card sort
- Veterans will want to fill out multiple forms for different appointments ahead of a trip to the VA

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated closed card sort exercises via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow us to prioritize our existing list of initiatives while learning about new potential areas to explore through Veteran feedback. After the sort, we will share a lo-fidelity mockup to get Veteran feedback. 

## Participants and Recruitment	
We would like to talk with 8 participants:
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 person of color
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater

**Recruitment requirements**
- The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
- The participants know how to screenshare

*This study requires participants to drag and drop elements and requires screensharing.*

**Questions for screener**
- Have you visted the VA for primary care in the last year? (pass = yes)
- Have you visted the VA for specialty care in the last six months? (pass = yes)
- Have you visted a non-VA healthcare provider in the last year? (pass = yes or no)
