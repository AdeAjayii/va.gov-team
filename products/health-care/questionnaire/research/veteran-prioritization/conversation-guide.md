# Conversation Guide for Initiatve Prioritization

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aricka and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to do a sorting exercise to help our team understand what healthcare questions and forms are most important to Veterans. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 mintues.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we begin, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Could you tell me about your service history?
- How often do you have appointments at the VA? 
- What types of appointments do you have at the VA?
- Have you ever had to answer questions about your health before, during, or after a VA appointment? (For example, on a form, screening tool, ipad, etc.) 
    - If so, what was that experience like? 

## Topic: Card sort - 20 minutes

I'm going to send you a link in the chat. Once the link pulls up, will you share your screen with me?

> Wondering if we should just share our screen and have them talk us through it?

[CARD SORT LINK HERE]()

Before we begin, I want to give you some context for this execise. Think about the questions you are asked before, during, and after your appointments at the VA. Let's say that you are able answer some of these questions ahead your visit through filling out a form. Take a look at the items on the left side of the screen. We are going to do a sorting exercise so that I can understand which questions/topics would be most valuable to you and your care. 

I have some categories listed here. Go ahead and drag an item from the left and drop it into a category based on importance to you. If you have questions or need clarification, feel free to ask me as you move through the exercise.


### Things to listen for:

- _Which questions/topics does the Veteran see as most important? Least important?_
- _Pay attention to Veteran commentary on the topics/categories._
- _Take note of any topics/questions the Veteran suggests to add._

## Topic: Sort within categories

Now that all of the topics are sorted, let's look at each category and sort based on importance one more time. Let's start with the least important column and move to the others from there.

**Questions to consider**
- Talk me through why you chose this topic
- What does this topic mean in your words?
- What has your experience been with this question/topic in your appointments?

### Things to listen for:

- _How does the Veteran interpret the sorted cards?_
- 

## Topic: Form feedback

Great, thank you for doing that exercise. I'm going to actually share my screen and show you what one of these forms may look like on the VA website. I would love your feedback on [WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR HERE?]

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
