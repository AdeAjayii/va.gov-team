# Healthcare Experience Initiative Prioritization Research Findings

**Prepared by:** Aricka Lewis (aricka@adhocteam.us)<br>
August 2020

## Goal
The purpose of this study was to gain Veteran input on which healthcare questionnaires to prioritize for our team.

## Methodology
We conducted 8 moderated card sort sessions with Veterans. After the sort, we showed a sample "Reason for visit" questionnaire for initial feedback.

### Who we talked with
- 8 Veterans
- Representative of ages 35 to 75+

## High level findings
- 7 out of 8 Veterans sorted the "Top concerns/goal for visit" card into the "fill out ahead of time" category.
- Veterans used the "unsure/not applicable" category when questions didn't apply to them or when they assumed the VA would already have the information.
- Veterans assume that the VA has their background information.
- Veterans see a benefit in completing forms with the VA online before their appointments.
- Veterans assumed that the text fields on the mockup were related. 

## Details of findings
**7 out of 8 Veterans sorted the "Top concerns/goal for visit" card into the "fill out ahead of time" category.**<br> A majority of Veterans stated that filling out a reason for visit questionnaire before their appointment would be beneficial for a few reasons. Including:
- Save time while waiting in lobby before appointment
- Communicating what issues they are facing through writing instead of verbally
- Optimize time with provider to talk about important information/issues

**Veterans used the "unsure/not applicable" category when questions didn't apply to them or when they assumed the VA would already have the information.** <br> Veterans that stated sorted topics like "alcohol use" "tobacco use" and "suicide/depression)" stated that those issues do not affect them. Additionally, Veterans that were affected by these topics were split between either wanting to fill them out ahead of their appointment or dicuss them in person.

**Veterans assume that the VA has their background information.** <br> They stated that the VA should know information related to family medical history, social history, and past medical history. Multiple participants mentioned that they would rather update this information if it changed instead of filling it out before every visit.

**Veterans see a benefit in completing forms with the VA online before their appointments.**

**Veterans assumed that the text fields on the mockup were related.**


## Actionable Recommendations
- Consider pre-populating known background information on forms<br> Examples:
  - Family medical history
  - Tobacco and alcohol use
  - Veteran bio
 
- Explore a logged-in medical profile experience
  - How might we centralize all known Veteran health information?
  - Editable information that gets sent to provider
  
- Consider time-sensitive experiences for sensitive questions
  - Day of updates for suicide/depression
  
- Create visual separation between the reason for visit text fields
