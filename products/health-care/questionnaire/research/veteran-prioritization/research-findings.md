## Goal
The purpose of this study was to gain Veteran input on which healthcare questionnaires to prioritize for our team. 

### Research questions and answers
**What topics/questions would Veterans find useful to answer ahead of an appointment?**
- Answer

**What topics/questions do Veterans find most beneficial to their healthcare experience?**

**How do Veteran sorted priorities align with what we have learned from clinicians?**


## Methodology
- Link to mockups
- Link to card sort findings

## High level findings
- 7 out of 8 Veterans sorted the "Top concerns/goal for visit" card into the "fill out ahead of time" category.
- There are XX main Veteran assumptions for filling out forms ahead of appointments. 
- Veterans used the "unsure/not applicable" category when questions didn't apply to them or when they assumed the VA would already have the information.
- Veterans see a benefit in completing forms online before their appointments.
- Veterans assume that the VA has their background information centralized.

## Actionable Recommendations
- Consider pre-populating known background information on forms<br> Examples:

  - Veteran bio
 
- Explore a logged-in medical profile experience

  - Editable information that gets sent to provider
  
- Consider time-sensitive experiences for sensitive questions
  - Day of updates for suicide/depression
