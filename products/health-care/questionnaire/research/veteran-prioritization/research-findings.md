# Healthcare Experience Initiative Prioritization Research Findings

**Prepared by:** Aricka Lewis (aricka@adhocteam.us)<br>
August 2020

## Goal
The purpose of this study was to gain Veteran input on which healthcare questionnaires to prioritize for our team.

## Methodology
- Link to mockups
- Link to card sort findings

## High level findings
- 7 out of 8 Veterans sorted the "Top concerns/goal for visit" card into the "fill out ahead of time" category.
- Veterans either wanted to fill out personal information ahead of their appointment and dicuss appointment specific details in person or they wanted to discuss personal information in person and only fill out appointment specific information ahead of time.
- Veterans used the "unsure/not applicable" category when questions didn't apply to them or when they assumed the VA would already have the information.
- Veterans see a benefit in completing forms online before their appointments.
- Veterans assume that the VA has their background information centralized.

## Actionable Recommendations
- Consider pre-populating known background information on forms<br> Examples:
  - Family medical history
  - Tobacco and alcohol use
  - Veteran bio
 
- Explore a logged-in medical profile experience
  - How might we centralize all known Veteran health information?
  - Editable information that gets sent to provider
  
- Consider time-sensitive experiences for sensitive questions
  - Day of updates for suicide/depression
