_Still in draft_
# Upcoming appointment questionnaire MVP usability study

**Prepared by:** Kristen McConnell (kristen.mcconnell@adhocteam.us)<br>
October 2020

## Background
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners. Our MVP will focus on improving the pre-appointment experience when visiting primary care providers.

## Goal
This research is to usability test a mobile and desktop version of the upcoming appointment questionnaire design and gain feedback on the content/wording within the questionnaire.

## Hypotheses to be tested
- Veterans will be able to successfully complete the questionnaire.
- There will be minimal confusion created by the content and question wording within the questionnaire.

## Methodology
We conducted 8 remote moderated usability tests via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype (mobile and desktop versions) to confirm if our questionnaire is easily usable by Veterans.

## High level findings

Usability task: Complete the questionnaire
- 8 out of 8 participants 
  - were able to easily complete the questionnaire without problems.
  - clicked the top “Answer questions” button without really reading the rest of the Introduction page.
      -“I never read all this stuff.”
- 2 out of 8 Veterans
    - made changes/added text to the pre-populated additional details question.
    
Introduction page
- Most of the Veterans found the “What happens after I answer the questions?” section valuable information to understand.
- 8 out of 8 Veterans expected all the information shown to exist on a page like this.
  - “It is what I expect from a government website.”
  - “It’s the standard...it looks pretty good. It is pretty self-explanatory.”
  - “It is what you want to hear before you are entering any medical questions.”
      - This expectation could explain why all Veterans skipped reading this page during the initial usability task.
          - “I never read all this stuff.”
          
Veteran information page
- 6 out of 8 Veterans have experience changing demographic information (addresses or phone numbers were most often mentioned).
  - 2 out of 8 discussed having difficulty making the changes
- 6 out of 6 Veterans preferred to make edits to their demographic information with a profile section and not within this questionnaire.	
  -  The profile section was seen as more  of a place of authority. Many Veterans mentioned that they thought the changes would disseminate further across the VA from a profile section. 
- One Veteran also wanted to note a preferred name (what they wanted the doctor to call them) instead of just a legal name within VA.gov.

This visit page
- All of the Veterans reconfirmed the value in a questionnaire of this type and thought it would help focus their appointments on their areas of interest.
  - “The more information that you give your primary care the more opportunity they will have to get it right.”
  - “I see a lot of value.”
- 3 out of 8 Veterans didn’t think that they could or should edit the additional details questions. A few other them saw that question as the chief complaint of why they were going to the appointment.
- 6 out of 8 thought prioritizing could help get their most important questions answered first. 
- Veterans are split on whether transferring information was valuable or not. Some Veterans said to give people the option and some described limiting it to follow-ups, appointment types, or same doctor.
- 2 Veterans wanted to additional questions based upon what was written in the additional details question. For instance, if you wrote about pain, then asking where is the pain located, has the pain recently gotten worse, what kind of pain is it?
- Without prompting, 2 Veterans wanted to add the ability to send images along with this questionnaire, because “A picture is worth a thousand words.”
- 3 Veteran expected the providers to read these questionnaires well in advance of the appointment. They were particularly interested in hearing about any labs or tests that the provider thought should be completed, then scheduling and completing said tests prior to the actual appointment.
  - “This would be nice. I know that they are very busy though. Maybe the nurse can review it and highlight things, then talk to the doctor?”
- Timeline for when they want to fill out this questionnaire:
  - A week - two days prior to an appointment
- 1 Veteran was interested in knowing when the provider read this questionnaire’s information (a read receipt).
- 1 Veteran wanted the ability to print out the questionnaire and bring it to the appointment as a way to remind them of what they wanted to talk about that day with the provider.

Review page
- 8 out of 8 Veteran expected this review page to exist as well as the ability to edit their answers on this page.
  - One Veteran had such a strong association with editting on the review page, that they wanted to remove the demographic information on this page, because it was read only.
      - “I already reviewed the information earlier on in the form.”
      - “It is good to review everything.”
  - Two Veterans wanted more descriptive address labels on this page, such as mailing and residential.
  
Confirmation page  
- What additional information should be added to this page?
  - 6 out of 8 Veterans mentioned phone numbers to get questions answered would be helpful.
      - A link to secure messaging was also mentioned: 2
  - 4 out of 8 Veterans mentioned showing a list of bloodwork or other tests that should be completed prior to the appointment would be helpful.
  - 1 out of 8 Veterans wants to see the doctor’s name.
      - “So I know who is viewing my data. I know of get considered about that sometimes. It would also be good to know who exactly I’m seeing for that appointment.”
- 1 Veteran is interested in seeing when the provider has read the information sent within this questionnaire.
- Where do Veterans want to navigate to next after finishing this questionnaire?
  - List of other questionnaires to complete: 3
  - va.gov homepage: 3
  - List of all upcoming appointments: 5
  - Close the browser: 2
  - Find a VA location: 1
- 1 Veteran wants to edit after sending.
- 3 Veteran sees this connected to myHealtheVet or living on myHealtheVet.
- 1 Veteran expected the provider to look at this right within 48-72 hours after the Veteran fills it out and to hear back from them about bloodwork or other things to complete before the appointment.
- 1 Veteran wants to see directions to the clinic on this page.
