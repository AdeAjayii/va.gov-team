## Action Items
 - [ ] other teams- tickets in backlog to see scope and collaborate. to ensure its in the ready state vs. moving to current sprint.- ie. notes on how to use it.
 - [ ] Keep asking in all team meetings with our partners what their timelines are for any dependencies and blockers we have to ensure they know we are waiting for them and to align our roadmaps for a target go live date.
