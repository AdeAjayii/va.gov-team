## Epic User Story
As a Veteran, I want to provide my my care team with what is important to me to focus on for this visit.


Use these data elements for UI mockup in User testing as Proof of Concept Q3 priorities. 

[WIP Content for the below Fields](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/design/proof-of-concept/content-v1.md) 

1. **Reason For Visit**
    - free text (small size)
    - This field comes from Call Center, Reg Clerk, or VAOS asking the patient why they are needing an appointment.  
    - show this pre-populated or blank (ideally we will pull from the above and ask the Veteran if they want to add any more detail or change all together) 
    - [VAOS screen shot for example content](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c-Ih1vlmavEpUwz5BdeyaJ44KYdHxWcE/view?usp=sharing) 
    - Examples:  “What can I do for you today?” or “Tell me what brings you in today.” 
    - Scientists have found that physicians only spend, on average, 11 seconds listening to their patients describe the reason for their visit before interrupting them, according to a study that was recently published in the [Journal of General Internal Medicine.](https://www.legalreader.com/physicians-ask-patients-explain-reason-visit-interrupt/)
2. **Primary Areas of Concern** 
    - this label and description need to be carefully worded so that the Veteran understands that the care team want to know what Acute/Chronic conditions are affecting them the most right now and what impact that is having on their every day lives.  This field coudl also be used to state any generic areas of importance the Veteran wants their care team to know is going on.  See [Initiative Priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/product/initiatives/README.MD)from Sharon for examples
   - text box (Large size ie. 500 characters)
   - example "Tell me how you're feeling right now"
3. **Questions you want to discuss with your care team.**
    - this should also have very clear description and maybe examples to the veteran knows what kind of things they can put here. 
    - free text
    - these should be individually entered and maybe prioritzed?
    - See [SHEP-Patient Experience Examples](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/product/feature-documentation/clinical-reminders/shep/pre-visit-checklist.docx)

    - contact (phone)
    - address

5. **Form Type**
