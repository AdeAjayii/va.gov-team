# This Visit Questionnaire 

Use these data elements for UI mockup in User testing as Proof of Concept Q3 priorities. 


1. **Reason For Visit**
    - free text (small size)
    - This field comes from Call Center, Reg Clerk, or VAOS asking the patient why they are needing an appointment.  
    - show this pre-populated or blank (ideally we will pull from the above and ask the Veteran if they want to add any more detail or change all together) 
    - [VAOS screen shot for example content](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c-Ih1vlmavEpUwz5BdeyaJ44KYdHxWcE/view?usp=sharing) 
2. **Primary Areas of Concern** 
    - this label and description need to be carefully worded so that the Veteran understands that the care team want to know what Acute/Chronic conditions are affecting them the most right now and what impact that is having on their every day lives.  This field coudl also be used to state any generic areas of importance the Veteran wants their care team to know is going on.

   - text box (Large size ie. 500 characters)
