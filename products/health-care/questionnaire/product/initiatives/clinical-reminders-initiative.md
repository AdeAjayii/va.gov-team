## Epic User Story 
As a Veteran, I want to provide my care team with the most current status of my social determines of health, so that my care team can be informed of areas I might need assistance, have barriers or concerns, or are ready/not to change.  

* **Use Case:** Veterans that state they do not have a safe place to stay or are feeling depressed are screened to ensure the care team is making the veteran aware of appropriate VA servies or education to assist in their wellness plan. 
* _Include Quote from Research or Clinical team_ 

* **Description:** The social determinants of health questions that are typically asked in screeners by the clinical care team are called Clinical Reminders. Most of the clinical reminders are national although some are still locally developed and maintained but nearly all of the screening questionnaires in primary care clinics are national.

## Hypothesis 

- Veterans believe that by filling out pre visit intake questionnaires they will not have to repeat their information as much as it will now be in their record.
- The Clinical Care team wants Veterans to provide pre-visit intake questionaires and screeners so they don't have to use so much time on data entry/asking questions.

## OKR's

Personal Experience
- Increase the employee care team satisfaction by spending less time transferring veteran-provided data from one medium (paper, iPads) to the electronic health record system

Collaboration 
- Decrease in the time to complete Clinical Reminders - Baseline estimation is 15-20 mins and is currently one of the biggest complaints by nursing

Seamless Journey
- Increase faster access to care and more timely delivery of services
- Increase in accuracy of health information available to the Care team
