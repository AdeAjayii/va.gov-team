# Healthcare Experience - Questionnaires Product Outline 

## Overview
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

## Problem Statement
Veterans are unable to consistently share and update current health status and medical history that is leveraged in their care across the VA and community providers

- How might we improve the in-person and online pre-appointment experiences for Veterans?
- How might we contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities?
- How might we better integrate Veteran-provided data into VA workflows?
- How might we provide Veterans with a digital option when only a paper option exist today to complete pre-appointment questionnaires and screeners?
