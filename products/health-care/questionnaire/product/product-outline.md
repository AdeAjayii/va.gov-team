# Healthcare Experience - Questionnaires Product Outline 
---

## Overview
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre- and post-appointment experiences for Veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate Veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing Veterans with a digital option to complete pre- or post-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

## Problem Statement
As a Veteran, Iâ€™m unable to easily and quickly provide pre and post visit documentation in a digital and discrete format that can be shared across facilities and my care team.

- How might we improve the in-person and online pre-appointment experiences for Veterans?
- How might we contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities?
- How might we better integrate Veteran-provided data into VA workflows?
- How might we provide Veterans with a digital option when only a paper option exist today to complete pre-appointment questionnaires and screeners?

## Desired Business Outcomes - Value Propositions

## Business Value
**Key areas of value to the business:** Data consolidation and accuracy, adoption of VA services, employee productivity, safety, materials cost, wait times

       
<details> <summary>Increase the adoption of other VA services offered on va.gov to improve the Veterans health and wellness</summary> 

- Once the Veteran has completed a digital intake form the workflow can auto direct them to other ares on the portal or va.gov site they might not know is available. ie education/health records/events.
- Increase the Patient Experience "satisfaction ratings" with Veteran facing solutions.

</details>

<details> <summary>Increase in employee productivity by reducing data entry of Veteran provided information into the system</summary>
 
- Save staff resourcing costs as they will be able to see more patients or complete other activities related to the patient care.
	- Increasing the patient and care team experience 
- Decrease the time it takes during a visit as staff will not have to ask and document the same questions the Veteran just filled out on the form
	- Increasing the time they can focus on the Veterans plan of care
- Reduce time spent by the reception staff gathering and ensuring all fields are fill out by Veteran.
	- The admin staff can rely on the software to prompt correct forms and ensure all required fields are populated.
	- Increasing the Veterans time spent with their care team.
	
</details>
    
<details> <summary>Increase in the accuracy of Veteran reported health information, by consolidating the number of [XXX] forms and questions across facilities and encounter type ensuring consistency in care and outcomes</summary>

- Reduction in the many types of forms in different formats/delivery methods that Veterans are asked to complete. 
- Veterans will consistently be asked the same question in a discrete ways across VA facilities so the information can be shared across encounters/visits and used in analytics/intelligence engines.
	- Veterans may have assumptions about how their data is used and shared that may differ from reality as they use multiple VA and community care centers. (i.e. what happens to their data when they submit the clipboard, vs, what they WANT to happen to their data)

</details>


<details> <summary>Increase safety of staff and veterans by encouraging physical distancing, allowing use of personal digital devices to complete forms</summary>
 
- Reduce the safety risk of transmitting infections diseases from pen and paper to patients and staff.
    - Veterans will not have to touch any facility devices or clipboards that are shared by other patients and staff. 
    - Reduce expenses (staff time and materials) as the need to disinfect after each use will be eliminated. 
- Reduce the safety risk of transmitting infections diseases from the veteran entering the facility too early and sitting in the waiting room.
    - Veterans will not be in close proximity to to other patients and staff waiting for their appt. and can comfortably wait in their car to be notified to enter at the appropriate time.

</details>

 
<details> <summary>Reduce cost to print, mail, maintain, dispose of paper pre-visit intake forms</summary>

 - The paper pre-visit intake forms will no longer be sent out via mail and reduced printed forms in the facility.
	 - A large amount of mailed forms are never filled out ahead of a visit.
- Reduce the storage and disposal and or maintenance of scanned in pdf forms into the system. 

</details>


<details> <summary>Reduce facility wait times and length of visit time by reducing the number of tasks a veteran must complete within a facility</summary>

- Decrease the length of time for a visit by avoiding handwriting and integrating Veteran health information discretely into the EHR
- Veterans may struggle to write legibly on paper forms can be hard to read for the staff/clinical team requiring them to confirm and ask the same questions so they can document in to the system.
- Implementing the use of digital check in, will save time by providing accurate ready to be seen indicators to the the care team
	- The staff and care team can avoid waiting on Veterans that haven't finished their intake forms and check-in ahead of the appointment time. (need acceptable window from facility to allow "virtual" checkin)

</details>


<details> <summary>Once bill pay is integrated, Increase the dollar amount and number of outstanding and current visit invoices paid by the Veteran</summary>

- Ability to collect more payments, as the prompts for copay and/or past due balance can be integrated into the same intake forms entry Veterans are already answering.
