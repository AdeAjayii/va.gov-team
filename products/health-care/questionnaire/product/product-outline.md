# Healthcare Experience - Questionnaires Product Outline 
---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address. [Here's a sample problem statement definition activity you can try on your team to help generate this](https://www.atlassian.com/team-playbook/plays/problem-framing)*

*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*
 
## Desired User Outcomes/Hypothesis 

- *Why would a user want to use this?*
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

### If we implement the use of digital pre-visit intake forms, we will 

#### Time
- **decrease the time it takes before a visit to fill out the questions**
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans forms can be pre-populated with known profile and health history sections, leaving only updates and current visit symptoms/screener to be completed by the veteran.
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans typically do not complete the mailed/emailed version of the printed intake form and complete it before their visit
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans may not know how long it will take them before a visit to fill out the forms and not arrive in enough time
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans think filling out forms is a pain point/redundant task.	
 
#### Safety
- **reduce the safety risk of transmitting infections diseases from pen and paper to patients and staff.**
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans will not have to touch any facility devices or clipboards that are shared by other patients and staff.  This will also reduce expenses (staff time and materials) as the need for staff to disinfect after each use.
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans may have concerns about using pen, paper, clipboard that may have not been cleaned before their use
- **reduce the safety risk of transmitting infections diseases from the veteran entering the facility too early and sitting in the waiting room.**
	- _Assumption_ -  Veterans will not be in close proximity to to other patients and staff waiting for their appt. and can comfortably wait in their car to be notified to come in at appropriate time. 

#### Data Interoperability
- **increase the patient entered health data discretely and accuracy into the medical record by consolidating the questions being asked at each facility.**
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans may have assumptions about how their data is used and shared that may differ from reality as they use multiple VA and community care centers. (i.e. what happens to their data when they submit the clipboard, what they WANT to happen to their data)
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans will consistently be asked the same question in a discrete way across facilities so the information can be shared across encounters/visits and used in analytics/intelligence engines.  
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans are asked to complete many different types of forms in different formats/delivery methods.
- **reduce duplication and user errors by populating patient reported data into the EHR and each subsequent form complete .**
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans may not understand that all their paper documentation is not transcribed into their chart and reviewed by their care team at subsequent visits.

#### Personal Experience
- **improve the Veteran/Care Team experience.**
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans want an option to complete these forms digitally.
- **reduce the feeling of the impersonal clipboards, ipads, and clunky kiosks** by providing the veterans the option of using their personal device of choice on their own time
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans may not understand that they can use their personal devices to complete pre-visit documentation on their own time
- **increase the number of forms completed before a visit,**  by providing an unauthenticated experience (Eliminate usernames and passwords)
  - _Assumption_ - [insert specific research study] shows that consumers who are not required to login are XX more likely to complete a transaction with a business/healthcare facility. 
- **improve the Caregivers experience of providing access to and pre-populating past medical history about their veteran they might not remember or be aware of**
	- _Assumption_ - Caregivers will have a unique experience related to assisting filling out forms for Veterans

#### Adoption of other platform experiences
- **increase portal/va.gov adoption by navigating the veteran to other workflows/areas they can use to improve their health.** 
	- _Assumption_ - Once the veteran has completed a digital intake form we can auto direct them to other ares on the portal or va.gov site they might not know are available to them. ie education/health records/events. 
  - _Assumption_ - This should increase the Patient Expereince "ratings" with veterans facing solutions. 
	
## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

### If we implement the use of digital pre-visit intake forms, we will 

#### Time
- **decrease the time it takes during a visit**
	- _Assumption_ - the care team (administrative staff, nurse and physicians) will not have to ask and document the same questions the Veteran just filled out on the form.
	- _Assumption_ - the care team will be able to see more patients in a day increasing the Patient Experience and Costs Savings.
- **reduce the time spent by the front reception staff gathering and ensuring all fields are fill out by veteran slowing down access to providers**
	- _Assumption_ - The admin staff can rely on the software to prompt correct forms and ensure all required fields are populated. 
- **save wait times by the care team as the Veteran will not ignore the mailed paper intake forms** and need to fill out in the clinic before the visit. 	
	- _Assumption_ - a large amount of mailed forms are never filled out ahead of a visit. 	
- **decrease the length of time for a visit by avoiding handwriting and leveraging digital tools to discretely populate the EHR**
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans handwriting on paper forms can be hard to read for the admin/clinical team requiring them to confirm and asks same questions so they can document.  
	- _Assumption_ - Veterans may struggle to write legibly on a printed form so the care team can read during the visit
- **If we implement the use of digital check in we will** 
	- **save time by providing accurate ready to be seen indicators to the the care team**
	  - _Assumption_ - The admin and care team will avoid waiting on veterans that haven't finished their intake forms and check-in process ahead of the appointment time.  (need acceptable window from facility to allow "virtual" checkin)

#### Reduce Risk & Increase Compliance
- **increase compliance by prompting for documents that may be outstanding for signature, consent or acknowledgement forms.** 
	- _Assumption_ - Administrative staff might not always know or miss which forms need to be updated by the veteran before the visit. 

#### Cost Savings
- **save costs in paper production, stamps, and administrative staff time to mail intake documentation.**
	- _Assumption_ - The paper pre-visit intake forms will no longer be sent out via mail or printed in the facility. 
- **collect more payments as the prompts for CoPay and/or Past Due Balance** 
	- _Assumption_ - The workflow can be built into the same Questionnaires Veterans are already answering. 
- **save costs in staff resourcing as they will be able to see more patients or complete other activities related to the patient clinical experience.** 
	- _Also applies to all of the Time hypotheses statements above_
