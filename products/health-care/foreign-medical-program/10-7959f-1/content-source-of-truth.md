{subtitle} Foreign Medical Program (FMP) Registration Form (VA Form 10-7959f-1)

Veterans can use this form to register in the VA Foreign Medical Program (FMP). The Foreign Medical Program is a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care benefits program for U.S. Veterans who are residing or traveling abroad and have VA-rated, service-connected disabilities. Under FMP, VA assumes payment responsibility for certain necessary health care services associated with the treatment of those service-connected disabilities.

The information provided on this form will be used by VA to determine your eligibility for reimbursement for medical services outside the United States. 


#### [H2] What expenses are eligible for reimbursement under the FMP?

FMP will pay for health care services, medications, and durable medical equipment for service-connected conditions and conditions associated with and held to be aggravating a service-connected condition.

If you're a Veteran participating in the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) (also known as 38 U.S.C. Chapter 31; formerly known as the VA Vocational Rehabilitation Program), FMP may authorize foreign medical services for other conditions as well.
