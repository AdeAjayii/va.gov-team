# Product Outline: 10-7959f-1 Foreign Medical Program (FMP) Registration

---

## Overview
Under the IDEA Act, all user facing forms need to be digitized. For Veterans who are residing or traveling outside the US and are eligible for health coverage for a service-related condition, providing the Foreign Medical Program registration form online would allow them to more easily and quickly apply rather than go through the current paper process.

## Problem Statement
Veterans who are living or traveling outside the U.S. with a service connected disability are only able to apply for health care benefits by filling out the paper form and sending it through mail or fax. 

How might we improve the experience of Veterans living overseas who are applying for VA health care services? 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans are able to fill out the registration form online on VA.gov
- Veterans spend less time, effort and money filling out and mailing paperwork
- Veterans spend less time spent waiting to hear back on their application status 

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Veterans are unaware that they can apply online
- Veterans encounter errors during the online application process 
- Veterans have low confidence in the online process or have concerns around online security

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Reduce the volume of paperwork being processed that comes in through mail and fax
- Reduce the time and effort spent processing paper forms
- Reduce the amount of resubmissions due to missing information or documents

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Veterans are unaware they can fill out the application online
- The information entered online by Veterans is not successfully submitted to the VA
- Online forms processing adds confusion and complicates workflows further
