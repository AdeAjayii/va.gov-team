# Product Outline: 10-7959f-1 Foreign Medical Program (FMP) Registration

---

## Overview
Under the [IDEA Act](https://digital.gov/resources/delivering-digital-first-public-experience/), all user facing forms need to be digitized. For Veterans who are residing or traveling outside the US and are eligible for health coverage for a service-related condition, providing the Foreign Medical Program registration form online would allow them to more easily and quickly apply rather than go through the [current process](https://www.va.gov/health-care/foreign-medical-program/).

## Problem Statement
Veterans who are living or traveling outside the U.S. with a service connected disability are only able to apply for health care benefits by filling out the paper form and sending it through mail or fax. 

How might we improve the experience of Veterans living overseas who are applying for VA health care services? 
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Veterans are able to fill out the registration form online on VA.gov
- Veterans spend less time, effort and money filling out and mailing paperwork
- Veterans spend less time spent waiting to hear back on their application status 

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Veterans are unaware that they can apply online
- Veterans encounter errors during the online application process 
- Veterans have low confidence in the online process or have concerns around online security
- The response burden is increased for the user

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Reduce the volume of paperwork being processed that comes in through mail and fax
- Reduce the time and effort spent processing paper forms
- Reduce the amount of resubmissions due to missing information or documents

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Veterans are unaware they can fill out the application online
- The information entered online by Veterans is not successfully submitted to the VA
- Online forms processing adds confusion and complicates workflows further

## Assumptions
- Veterans will want to fill out their information online
- Providing the form online will reduce the processing time for FMP applications and reduce the amount of manual work needed to process paper FMP forms.

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

- In scope
- Out of scope
- Risks or dependencies: PEGA solution will need to be able to house files and handle the different workflows required for different documents and teams.
- Other considerations:
  - Content migration effort to va.gov and family member benefits hub - coordinate on timing
  - VA notify
  - handling for mobile app
