FMP Intro meeting, 1/22/24
FMP and VFMP (Veteran and Family member programs - higher level portfolio)
- Andy Szymczak (Director) 
- Jennifer Rivera - supervisor for eligibility and verification enrollment portion
- Stanley Nelson - program management supervisor analyst 
- Andrea Bingham - deputy 

High level overview of the form - 
- Registration and claims
- Registration - singular and for life
- Enduring life long thing - updates can occur later on (separate thing)

I’m overseas or potentially going 
(Service related disability)
- Submit, trigger for Jen’s team (vista/cp&E database entered manually)
- Can just sit there - static
- If they fill out the form and don’t have service related connections with VBA, it will get rejected
- Should do this prior to sending this for reimbursement 
- ONLY meant to treat service related disabilities

Go overseas - get benefits 
(Claims cover sheet)
- Does not apply to territories (PR, Guam, American Samoa) - not applicable
- Duration doesn’t matter (1 day), medical tourism (flying to DR), also expatriates (came off active duty in Germany) or never came home and just stayed
- Global in nature

Could maybe submit a claim form (use claim form to get them registered - if look in CP&E and don’t see it)

VR&E - 
- actively enrolled/participating with case manager, cover medical treatments beyond service related disabilities
- only if they’re required to run the program (if related to teeth and need to get a job, etc.) - case manager may say this dental treatment is needed (substantiated from case manager) - would provide those services
- This would be a minority

They’ll submit a claim on a form and not in the system - go in and look and (VBMS and VIS - won’t see) and can just issue denial letter. (Fwd and won’t have a choice but to deny them).

Actual applicants (volume) - 
- Every service disabled veteran traveling overseas 
- Pending queue - FMP registration (42 or 2 - high or low - avg 20s and 30s)
- Total of 822 that need to be processed in paper
- Avg processing time - really depends (2.5-3 an hour) some are quick, others can take an hour (amount of service connected conditions)

CP&E - has to be done by oldest - newest date (also conditions have to be grouped together) because there is limited amount of space
- Can we have VBMS (Veterans Benefits Mgt system - case management system for VBA) or VIS talk to VES?
- (VIS is not the same as VBMS - need to make sure the systems are matching up)
- Both VBA programs - have to verify the info
