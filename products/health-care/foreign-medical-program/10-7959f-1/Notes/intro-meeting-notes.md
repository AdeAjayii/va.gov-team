FMP Intro meeting, 1/22/24
- FMP and VFMP (Veteran and Family member programs - higher level portfolio)
- Andy Szymczak (Director) 
- Jennifer Rivera - supervisor for eligibility and verification enrollment portion
- Stanley Nelson - program management supervisor analyst 
- Andrea Bingham - deputy
- Other attendees: Brian Wilke, Rachael Penfil, Premal Shah, Mary Wang

High level overview: 
- Registration - singular and for life - updates can occur later on (separate)
- Overseas or potentially going and has service related disability
- User hits submit, trigger for Jen’s team (VISTA/CP&E database entered manually)
- Info just sits there - static
- If they fill out the form and don’t have service related connections with VBA, it will get rejected (user should do this prior to sending this for reimbursement)
- ONLY meant to treat service related disabilities

Claims cover sheet:
- Does not apply to territories (PR, Guam, American Samoa) - not applicable
- Duration doesn’t matter (1 day), medical tourism (flying to DR), also expatriates (came off active duty in Germany)
- Global in nature
- Possible scenario: could maybe submit a claim form (use claim form to get them registered - if look in CP&E and don’t see it)

VR&E - 
- actively enrolled/participating with case manager, cover medical treatments beyond service related disabilities
- only if they’re required to run the program (if related to teeth and need to get a job, etc.)
- case manager may say dental treatment is needed (substantiated from case manager) - would provide those services
- This would be a minority
- They may also submit a claim on a form and not in the system - go in and look and (VBMS and VIS - won’t see) and have to fwd on and issue denial letter

Volume of applicants: 
- Every service disabled veteran traveling overseas 
- Pending queue - FMP registration (42 or 2 - high or low - avg 20s and 30s)
- Total of 822 that need to be processed in paper
- Avg processing time - really depends (2.5-3 an hour) some are quick, others can take an hour (amount of service connected conditions)

CP&E - has to be done by oldest - newest date (also conditions have to be grouped together) because there is limited amount of space
- Can we have VBMS (Veterans Benefits Mgt system - case management system for VBA) or VIS talk to VES?
- (VIS is not the same as VBMS - need to make sure the systems are matching up)
- Both VBA programs - have to verify the info
