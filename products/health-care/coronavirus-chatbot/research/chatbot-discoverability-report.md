# COVID-19 Chatbot Research Report - Discoverability

Prepared by Todd Stanich on May 12, 2020

## Summary
This research covers a third round of testing with Veterans about the coronavirus chatbot. This round was specifically focused on the discoverability of the chatbot along with continued usability testing of the chatbot itself. Previous research is available here [round 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/covid19-chatbot/blob/master/docs/research/covid-19-chatbot-research-report.md) and [round 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/covid19-chatbot/blob/master/docs/research/chatbot-usability-report.md).

Most participants mentioned interacting with VA online through myheathevet or email and text message communication. When starting their search for information from va.gov, most participants referenced the coronavirus banner and interacted with the FAQ link within the banner. Once on the FAQ page some participants were able to easily navigate and locate the desired information. None of the participants viewing a version of the FAQ page with the subtle (link in paragraph style text) CTA for the coronavirus chatbot noticed the link. Some of the participants noticed the chatbot CTA when it was in a blue featured content box with a button. The term "chatbot" continues to evoke a variety of expectations from participants. Prior experiences with other chatbots often influence the likelihood a participant is to click on or interact with the VA coronavirus chatbot.

## Goals
- Identify areas where Veterans look for information about coronavirus on va.gov.
- Understand awareness and discoverability of the chatbot.
- Identify usability shortcomings and potential improvements for interacting with the chatbot.

## Methodology
Interviews were conducted with five Veterans over three days (May 5, 6, and 7 2020). During the interviews, Veterans were asked about the types and sources of COVID-19 information they were currently referencing or looking for. Participants were then given tasks to find certain COVID-19 information starting from the va.gov home page.

**Participants**
- Veterans
- 2 female and 3 male
- Between the ages of 35-74

## Findings

Our research continues to show participants have different preferences for how and where to locate information about COVID-19. Some respond well to using a chatbot while others avoid interacting with anything labeled as a "chatbot". The coronavirus FAQ page proved to be the most popular starting place for finding information when participants started from the va.gov homepage. The chatbot link on the FAQ page was often missed by participants, but the second style of CTA tested proved to be more visible to participants.

### Themes

#### The coronavirus FAQ page is a primary starting place for answering Veteran's questions about COVID-19 when starting from va.gov

Most participants mentioned accessing myheathevet more frequently than va.gov. Some participants also mentioned VA emails and text messages as their entry points to va.gov. When starting on va.gov to find coronavirus information, most participants were quickly attracted to the coronavirus banner and the FAQ link within it. Expectations for FAQ pages were generally aligned across participants and something most have referenced on other websites.

#### Key Takeaways
1. Most participants quickly started their search for information in the coronavirus banner on the va.gov homepage.
2. Of those who began their search in the coronavirus banner, most clicked on the FAQ page link as their first interaction.
3. Several participants said they use FAQ pages on other websites when looking for this type of information.

#### Quotes

"[I would go to] the coronavirus frequently asked question page" - P1 referencing where on va.gov they would go to get coronavirus information

"I'm already starting to lose interest in this [va.gov coronavirus banner]. I would go to MHV. It is very confusing and a lot of information here that isn't segmented into manageable parts." - P2 on the va.gov home page

"I definitely first check out the FAQ. That is normally where you can find the best information and it is 1,2, 3. That is pretty much where I go for any website." - P3

"You know, I use FAQs sometimes but not a lot. There are usually so many that I can't find what I'm looking for. This [VA FAQ page] has a few links and doesn't have too many." - P4


#### The coronavirus chatbot is not easily discovered by Veterans

All participants who viewed the FAQ page with the subtle chatbot link skipped over it while scanning the page. Those who viewed the CTA in a blue featured content box with a button were more likely to notice it. Some participants expected to be able to access the chatbot before the FAQ page.

##### Key Takeaways
1. All participants who viewed the FAQ page with the subtle chatbot CTA did not notice the callout. Some participants who viewed the FAQ page with the more prominent CTA did not notice the callout.
2. Some participants felt the chatbot would be better referenced before the arriving on the FAQ page.
3. Many participants do not use the main va.gov page and look for information on MHV or in VA email newsletters.

#### Quotes
"I didn't see it the first time because I was looking for something that stands out. It was too small." - P1 talking about chatbot link

"At this point I'm already one hyperlink into what I'm trying to look for and I'm already not finding what I want and this gets completely lost." - P2 referencing chatbot CTA

"I never would have gotten to this page. If it was easier to get to, I absolutely would have gotten better information than I was searching for" - P2 on chatbot

"I would save this in my browser because I wouldn't remember how to get back to it." - P2 in reference to chatbot

"Oh no, I didn't see that" - P3 talking about chatbot link

"Most Vets are my age or older, they would never get here." - P2


#### The term "chatbot" has varying expectations among Veterans
Most participants have interacted with chatbots of some kind on other websites. Participant's prior experiences with other chatbots influenced how likely they were to interact with the coronavirus chatbot. Some participants did not consider the coronavirus chatbot to be a "chatbot" after interacting with it. In some cases, this was actually a positive as they found the coronavirus chatbot to be a better experience than other chatbots.

#### Key Takeaways
1. Some participants had negative experiences with chatbots in the past that impacted how likely they were to interact with a chatbot on va.gov.
2. After viewing the
3. Some participants do not consider this a chatbot.

#### Quote

"I've used some other chatbots, sometimes they can be slow in response. If this is instant... Because it says "bot" I would expect it to not be a person. The automated systems were frustrating, they wouldn't understand my question." - P1

"I like what I'm seeing" - P1 referencing chatbot

"This is what I would expect from frequently asked questions." - P2 in reference to the chatbot

"I have [used chatbots], I'm not a big fan of them. I would not click on it [chatbot link]. I would reconsider that now after clicking on it. [I would reconsider it now] because it was the information I was ultimately looking for. I wouldn't consider it a chatbot, it is more frequently asked questions." - P2

"I love them [chatbots]. Some people are really really lazy and don't want to search for it." - P3

"I like that it has options [instead of typing] because sometimes I'm not sure what my topic would be." - P3 on chatbot

"I definitely like the chatbot, it was two clicks and I was done without having to scroll through the FAQ." - P3

"I generally find them [chatbots] useless and have to call. The automated ones are a pain and if it is a real person they usually don't know what is going on with the business." - P4


### Additional findings
- CDC continued to be referenced as a trusted source of COVID-19 information.
- "Clara" the CDC self-checker name was called out by one participant. The participant stated they knew it was just a computer, it didn't need a cheesy name, "this is totally not necessary, we are all Veterans here not kids. Get to the point".
- One participant called out the CDC's coronavirus home page as a good example of displaying information and resources.
- Most participants found the topics covered by the chatbot to cover off all their questions about COVID-19.
- MHV is more frequently used by participants than the va.gov page.
- Most participants mentioned VA email newsletters and using those as an entry point to the website.
- One participant started their search for information on va.gov by using the search function and did not receive helpful results.

## Future research opportunities
- A number of enhancements were suggested by Veterans during testing (ex: free text entry, ability to chat with a live person, etc). These areas should be further researched if we decide to explore those solutions.
- The name, "chatbot" continues to be a polarizing term. There is an opportunity for further research around naming.
- One participant opened the CDC coronavirus page and contrasted it with the VA coronavirus banner and FAQ page. Further research could be conducted about a landing page for all COVID-19 resources.
