# COVID-19 Chatbot Conversation Guide
**3/30/2020**
## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Todd and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about COVID-19 resources and share a tool with you for your feedback.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the tool, letâ€™s start with a few questions.
- Have you looked for information about COVID-19?
 - If so, where have you looked? What type of information have you looked for?
- Have you visited the VA website?
 - If so, how did you get there (type in, google search, bookmark) and what page did you visit? (local facility, main VA page, myhealthevet)
- Have you used VA resources for information related to COVID-19?
 - If so, what information were you looking for and where did you find your answer?
 - If not, what resources would you use if you had a question about COVID-19?

## Transition to Tasks
 I am going to share a link with you. Once open, I'll walk you through how to share your screen with me so I can see what you are seeing.

## First Task: COVID-19 Symptoms - 5 minutes

- You have arrived at this page from a link on the VA website. Describe what you are seeing and your expectations for this page.
- Let's say you have symptoms and think you might have COVID-19, how would you proceed?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant understand they are interacting with a bot and not a human?
- Is the participant able to clearly read the prompts and respond with the appropriate interactions.
- Does the chatbot provide a helpful outcome?
- Are any questions confusing or misinterpreted?

## Second Task: VA Appointment - 5 minutes
Let's say you have an appointment scheduled at a VA facility and you are wondering if you should still go. How would you use this tool to find this information?

### Things to watch for:
- Is the participant able to get to the non-symptom decision tree questions?
- Is the participant able to correctly identify the correct top-level category?
- Is the participant satisfied with the answer?
- If the participant makes a wrong choice while navigating the topics, are they able to recover and backtrack?

## Third Task: Content Categorization - 5 minutes
- Select that you do not have symptoms.
- Looking at this list of categories, what kind of information would you expect in each?
- Is there anything here you would expect to see that you do not?

### Things to watch for:
- What types of content do participants expect in each category?
- Is there anything they expect to be in a category that we do not have content for?
- Do participants expect certain content to be in different categories?
- Are there expected categories missing?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- What are your overall thoughts on a tool like this?
- Is this something you would consider using if you encountered it on the VA website?
 - If so, under what circumstances?
- Any questions for me?

## Thank You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson?
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
