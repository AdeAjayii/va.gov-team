# Research Plan for Coronavirus Chatbot
**4/30/2020**

This document outlines a research plan for testing the discoverability and usability of the coronavirus chatbot.
## Goals
Previous rounds of research focused on a chatbot as a way of communicating information and the usability of the chatbot. This round will focus on the discoverability of coronavirus information and the chatbot itself on va.gov. We will also continue to evaluate the overall usability of the chatbot.
- Identify areas where users look for information about coronavirus on va.gov.
- Understand awareness and discoverability of the chatbot.
- Identify usability shortcomings and potential improvements for interacting with the chatbot.

Our hypothesis is that participants will follow many different paths on va.gov to find coronavirus information and that the chatbot is difficult to discover during that process.


## Method
We will conduct remote testing using screen sharing over Zoom.

## Participants and Recruitment
We are seeking 6 participants and will work with Perigean to recruit participants.  

Criteria:
- Veterans or those who care for a Veteran
- Mix of genders
- Mix of ages
- Bonus if the participant has sought information (online or over phone) from VA about COVID-19.

**Availability:**
