# Coronavirus Chatbot Conversation Guide
**4/30/2020**
## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Todd and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about coronavirus resources and share a website with you for your feedback.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few questions.
- Have you looked for information about coronavirus?
 - If so, where have you looked? What type of information have you looked for?
- Have you visited the VA website?
 - If so, how did you get there (type in, google search, bookmark) and what page did you visit? (local facility, main VA page, myhealthevet)
- Have you used VA resources for information related to coronavirus?
 - If so, what information were you looking for and where did you find your answer?
 - If not, what resources would you use if you had a question about coronavirus?

## Transition to Tasks
Now I'll share a link with you walk you through how to share your screen with me so I can see what you are seeing.

## First Task: Coronavirus information discovery - 10 minutes

- **If the participant gave an example of relevant information they are looking for during the warm up questions, use that to walk through this scenario**. If not, use this scenario - Let's say you are wondering if the stimulus check will impact your VA benefits.
- How would you find the answer to that question?

### Things to watch for:
- Where does the participant look for information on the page?
- What does the participant read on the page?
- Where does the participant interact with on the page?
- When the participant clicks on something, does the result match their expectations?

## Second Task: Coronavirus chatbot - 10 minutes
- If the participant has not yet discovered the chatbot, direct them there.
- What are your first impressions of this page?
- How can you find the same information (from task 1) using this?

### Things to watch for:
- Is the participant able to find relevant information?
- If the participant found this information somewhere else on va.gov previously, how did the chatbot experience compare?
- While interacting with the chatbot, do the responses match the participant's expectations?
- Does the participant encounter any usability challenges?


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- How did you feel about finding coronavirus information on the VA website?
- What are your overall thoughts on a tool like the chatbot?
- Is this something you would consider using if you encountered it on the VA website?
 - If so, under what circumstances?
- Any questions for me?

## Thank You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson?
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
