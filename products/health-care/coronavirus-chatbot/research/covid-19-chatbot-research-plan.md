# Research Plan for COVID-19 Chatbot
**3/30/2020**

This document outlines a research plan for the proposed COVID-19 information chatbot.
## Goals
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an increase of Veterans and care teams seeking information from the VA about COVID-19 symptoms, exposure, testing, quarantine, prevention, and other topics. The goals of this research include:
- Understand how Veterans seek out information about COVID-19.
- Validate if a chatbot provides satisfactory information and a positive experience.
- Identify the preferred experience to interact with a chatbot (through guided prompts, free text, or hybrid).

Our hypothesis is that a chatbot can provide many Veterans with the information they are seeking about COVID-19 and reduce the amount of calls to VA call centers as a result.

## Method
We will conduct remote interviews and testing using an interactive prototype via Zoom.

## Participants and Recruitment
We are seeking 5-6 participants and will work with Perigean to recruit participants.
Criteria:
- Veterans or those who care for a Veteran
- Mix of genders
- Mix of ages
- Bonus if the participant has sought information (online or over phone) from VA about COVID-19.

Please note, given the early stage of our prototype, it will not yet meet accessibility standards.

## When? 	
We are able to begin testing Thursday, April 2. We understand this does not provide the requested full week notice for recruitment. Our availability to schedule testing extends through next week.
**Availability:** 8AM - 6PM ET Thursday, April 2 - Friday, April 10

A pilot session will take place Wednesday, April 1 with either Ramya Ramesh or Katie Ho.
