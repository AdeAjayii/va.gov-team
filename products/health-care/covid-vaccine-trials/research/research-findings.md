## Research Goals 

This study aimed to get feedback from Veterans on the clinical trial enrollment tool in order to evaluate whether or not the design supports the following goals:

1. What are users' (Veterans') expectations for intake for a clinical trial?
2. Can users effectively find and complete the intake form?
3. How does COVID-19 affect user's perception of participation in clinical trials?
4. What are users' expectations after completing the intake form?

## Research Methodology 

We conducted 45-60 minute remote sessions using Zoom, tailored specifically to mobile devices. 

- Each session included a moderator and one participant, and started with a brief warm-up interview.
- Participants used a [staging landing page](https://staging.va.gov/alt-covid-research-lp/), which led them to a clickable prototype that contained the enrollment form.

## Findings

### Landing page

1. **5 of 6 Veterans said their motivation for volunteering in a clinical trial is to help other people.**

- "Hopeful to help myself or others in the same situation"
- "Although I think I'm not as protective of my info - if I can provide info to the greater good, I don't mind doing that."
- "if you can help other people then why not"



2. **<u>All participants</u> had individual threshholds or limits for what would make them NOT participate in a trial.** 

- "1000 needles in your back, a bone marrow test, might stop me"
- "Without more info, would say 6/10 chance to participate—I'm worried about potential side effects."
- Summarizing a few quotes from the same participant: Yes, I'm willing to participate, but I want to be compensated for it, especially for travel.
- "Sometimes you read the first part and you're like 'I'm in…but then you read the details…'."
- "I don't want to be a guinea pig, I'm not volunteering to be vaccinated just because."



3. **<u>All participants</u> assumed the VA is looking for volunteers for research in order to develop a vaccine, or some other medical treatment.** 

- "Looking for guinea pigs."
- "Trying to prevent covid, better ways to do it."
- "Up to VA to decide if I meet their reqs for participation in the testing."



4. **2 participants wanted to know more detailed information about the folks doing the research, and their competency**

- "Want to know more about research team and their track record, cost…goals and objectives."
- "I want to read and see exactly what it's about."



5. **COVID-19 had not drastically changed any participants relationship to VA, but expressed concern regarding the logistics of volunteering for a trial during the pandemic.**

- "If I were required to travel since I'm in quarantine…don't want the risk…impact of testing on me with my health issues."
- "We took Lysol to the hotel in Orlando and cleaned it…you say it's clean but what does that mean?"
- "Trying to be safe, try not to get the virus."



6. **Participants found the information on the landing page helpful.**

- "I like that there's a lot of info available, makes me more likely to participate."
- "I would spend 30 minutes digging into this."



### The form

1. **No participant had a problem with the length of the form.** Some of them quickly scanned the entirety of the form first to get a sense of form length. Only 2 participants noticed the sentence about time, but those folks found it helpful. — *Hypothesis: they saw the submit button and understood it was only a single page.*

- "The shorter the better."
- "Asked me the important stuff, like that it was short."



2. **All participants expected questions regarding health, and assumed the purpose of the questions were to help VA decide if they were a fit for a trial.**

- "Why birthday and height and stuff? Place me in a compatible group of like-aged people."
- "Expects to sign up for a volunteer list, expects health survey."
- "…if I were going into a study, there would be questions about it or my medical records."



3. **All participants were willing to hand over personal information, and assumed VA already had it.** 

- "There aren't any secrets I'm giving out."
- "If you're gonna be in a study there will be questions."
- "No hesitation, not invasive questions."




4. **The question "In the past 6 months, have you been hospitalized at any time?" confused a user:**

- "I don't know if they mean normal like surgery or for the testing I did."
- "I was there for testing—difference between having to be hospitalized?"



5. **One participant noted the questions "<u>Current gender identity</u>" and "<u>Race, ethnicity, and origin</u>" seemed moot and unnecessary.**

- "Gender identity, what does that have to do with covid?"
- "I see about diverse, plenty of options to not answer gender."



6. **Most participants thought the form was easy and simple to use. They generally completed the questions in about 3 minutes.**

- "It's pretty easy."
- "Just takes a minute to fill out."
- "It was intuitive, not hard."
- "Ask me the important stuff, like that it was short."



7. **Zero participants noticed they did not sign-in to fill out the form until it was brought to their attention.** However, once it was mentioned, there were polar opposite opinions:

- "Didn't occur to me that I didn't have to sign in—good thing—having to sign in is a disincentive."
- "I see the lock at the top but more comfortable with logging in."
- "Surprised no login feature—good idea. Establish identity."



8. **2 of 6 participants mentioned being cautious / aware of phony websites and spam, and liked that VA branding made it feel more secure and trusted.**

- "Lets you know it's a true VA page."

- "Could be giving info to anyone not the VA."

  



### Next steps?

1. There was confusion was around whether or not participants were signing up for a single trial or getting on a list for multiple trials. Because of this confusion, some initial expectations surrounding next steps varied.

   If they thought they were signing up for **a single trial**, they expected to see exactly what information they would need for that trial.

   If they thought they were signing up for **multiple trials (a list)**, they expected they would receive specific information regarding each trial.

   **Regardless of this confusion, all participants expected as much transparency and information from the VA as possible.** 

- "Some explicit instructions on what's going to take place during the study."
- "More info on specifics...what, when, how, duration…wondering what the next steps are. Guesses they'll contact me if they think I'm eligible." —*this person may have thought they signed up for a single trial*.
- "What's expected, I don't know? If I'm eligible, *maybe* I'll be contacted."
- "In my case would there be travel…in today's environment with travel if an overnight stay is required…make a reservation in advance if I have to stay overnight."
- "I'm a cancer survivor and I wouldn't push my luck on anything…I would take the time to read the page before clicking on anything."

  

2. **All participants expected to be contacted *at some point*, but the expectation of this ranged wildly from a few days to a few years**

- "Next 6 months? You know it's not gonna be tomorrow, will it be this year?"

- "normal VA system, put in a claim, never says how long it'll be."

- "Treat it like a guy I'm dating…'Maybe i'll hear back, maybe I wont'".

- "I'd probably forget the whole thing until I heard from them."

  

3. **When the VA contacted folks regarding trials, no one knew what method the VA would use to contact**

- "Sometimes they ask which way you prefer to be contacted, prefer to be called."
- "I'd get an email if I'm qualified to join or not."



4. **One person noted there was no way to opt out of the volunteer list**



5. **Participants were indifferent about VA accepting or rejecting them for a study**

- "If I don't meet the criteria I don't expect to participate"
- "Do I meet qualifications, then I get a phone call instead of an email"
- "If no contact, that's ok because you said I won't hear anything"
- "I may not fit for the study and that makes sense"



6. **2 of 6 participants wanted to know if they were qualified one way**

- "If I don't meet the criteria I don't expect to participate"



## Recommendations / take-aways

- There was discussion of dividing the form into sections—a single page worked well with all participants. It was helpful for some folks to be able to scan the page before beginning.

- Do not require sign in. No one batted an eye until it was mentioned. 

- The only question on the form that was problematic for anyone was the ambiguity around the question "In the past 6 months, have you been hospitalized at any time?" Recommend clarifying exactly what "hospitalized" means.

- Make it abundantly clear that people are signing up for a list or group that could be asked to participate in multiple trials or studies, not just one.

- Provide clear, decisive, and accurate information about the trial(s) that folks could be invited to participate. Timelines, side effects, travel, compensation, how invasive it could be, everything. Be as transparent and concrete as possible. 

  - All communications (websites, emails, texts) coming from VA should reinforce next steps with plain language that helps Veterans completely understand how they will be involved, what happens before and after, and any considerations they should take, especially during the pandemic.
  - All communications from the VA should be timely. All participants anticipated mediochre communication at best from the VA. We can do better! 
  - Recommend upon form submission, sending an email confirmation letting volunteers know:
    - Confimring what they signed up for
    - Timeline information (if avaialble)
    - Set expections / next steps
    - Provide a means to opt out

- After a Veteran signs up, always provide a means to opt out of the group.
