## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about some research on COVID-19 vaccine trial enrollment and we'd like to get your feedback on our prototype.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 mintues.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be tapable, and some will not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **During this session I would like you to try an think-out-loud.** That means, if you are reading something on the screen, please read it to me. If you see something you like or don't like please let me know. I want to hear you describe what you are doing and why during the session so I can follow along.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. None of your comments will be attributed to you directly. During the session I will ask you to share your phone screen with me.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"** 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the tool, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions. _Overall the goal for this section is to get a sense of their experience with clinical trials, if any_.

- How have things changed for you personally since the start of COVID-19?
- Do you receive any VA benefits at this time?
- How has your relationship with the VA changed since the start of COVID-19?
- Have you ever participated in a clinical research trial before?
  - **If yes**, Where did you participate (at the VA or another hospital)? 
  - How did you learn about that experience? 
  - How did you enroll in that trial?

## First Task: Complete intake form - 5 minutes

Ok, now I am going to ask you to share your screen with me. Please look at the bottom of your phone screen, in the center you should see a button that says "share content". Select that button. You should be prompted with an option to share "Zoom" and then "Screen". Then select "Start Broadcast". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help. 

Please tap anywhere to return to the Zoom App.

Great, now I can see your phone screen! Please text the following number 919-355-0995 with the message "research". *Send the number in chat if needed. Link to intake form for reference http://intake-form-URL/*

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Thank you for working through that with me. I just have a few more questions before we break.

- if the VA were to contact you about participating, how willing would you be to participate? What might sway you one way or another?
- What did you like or dislike about the experience of using that tool?
- Since I cannot see your hands, can you please describe how you you were holding your phone during the session?
- Is there anything else you would like to share?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
