# Conversation guide: Intake form Prototype Study 1 - Aug, 2020

## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute*

*In the Audio section, tap the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked*

*Check your [screensharing setup]*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup - 5 minutes 

Hi [participant name}, my name is Ryan. 

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. None of your comments will be attributed to you directly. During the session I will ask you to share your phone screen with me.
- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

  *Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 


- First I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today? 
  - Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems. 

- OK great. When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat".  If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions? 

- First I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the arrow that says "Share content" and hit "share screen". Select that button. You should be prompted with an option to share "Zoom" and then "Screen". Then select "Start Broadcast". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help. 
- Ok, tap anywhere on the screen to go back to the Zoom application. 

(Copy and paste the link to the prototype: https://staging.va.gov/alt-covid-research-lp/ / form in the chat of zoom.) 

- Now — I have pasted a link in the chat window. Can you open that up for me? (Remember - tap on the 3 dots on the right to go to chat.)

- Great, now I can see your phone screen!  We are going to use this prototype in our session today. I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments. 

*Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok? 

[Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? 

Great. Now we're really ready to begin! 

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about some research on COVID-19 clinical trial enrollment and we'd like to get your feedback on our prototype.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 mintues.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be tapable, and some will not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **During this session I would like you to try an think-out-loud.** That means, if you are reading something on the screen, please read it to me. If you see something you like or don't like please let me know. I want to hear you describe what you are doing and why during the session so I can follow along.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Thank you for working through that with me. I just have a few more questions before we break.

- If the VA were to contact you about participating in a clinical trial, how willing would you be to participate? Use a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is "not at all willing to participate" and 5 is "Very willing to participate".  
  - Why did you give that score? 
  - Have your feelings or concerns about participating in VA coronavirus clinical research changed at all from the start of today's session until now? 
   - If yes, what has changed? 
  - [Ask follow-up probing questions]

- How would you describe this process to a fellow Veteran? 

- Since I cannot see your hands, can you please describe how you you were holding your phone during the session?

- Is there any other feedback you would like to share?

- Do you have any other questions for me? 

## Thank you and Closing - 1 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
