# Research Plan for COVID vaccine trial enrollment tool, August 2020

## Goals	

Provide the first round of Veteran feedback on the tool (intake form) that allows Veterans to register for COVID-19 vaccine trial enrollment. 

The intake form allows the Veterans to quickly and remotely register for a VA-run COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. 

Our primary research questions are: 

- What are users' (Veterans) expectations for intake at for a clinical trial?
- Can users effectively find and complete the intake form?
- Does COVID-19 affect user's participation in clinical trials?
- Do users know what to do after completing the intake form? Are their expectations met?

Hypothesis:

We have built a fast, easily understood intake form that enables Veterans to register for VA-run, COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials.


## Method	

Directed interviews combined with usability testing of a high-fidelity prototype. Remotely moderated. Mobile devices only.
  	
We will use the interview questions to gather contextual information around the users expectations for a visit to VAMC during COVID and the intake processes, questions will be tailored to the users profile (Veteran, staff, etc) and whether they have visited since COVID precautions started. We also have a live version of the product to do usability testing.

Currently the prototype solution is available online. Users may access the prototype via text message or in Zoom. 

Preference for now is to use a ZoomGov account but will consider any option that will allow a user to remotely share their mobile screen.

## Participants and Recruitment	

Targeting 5 users including a mix of Veterans, non-Veteran visitors. Must be enrolled in VA Health Care or family member/caregiver of enrolled Veteran. Strong preference for anyone who has visited a VAMC in the last month.

Research recruiting contract required to supply participants.
