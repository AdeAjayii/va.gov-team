# COVID-19 related clinical research support
---

## Overview
Informing Veterans about the opportunity to participate in COVID-19 related clinical research, including vaccine trials, and providing interested Veterans with the first step.

## Problem Statement
How might we inform Veterans about rapidly evolving COVID-19 clinical trials being administered by VHA and encourage Veteran participation, particularly participation from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in clinical research, and provide interested Veterans with a very low effort way to get started?

## Desired User Outcomes

Veterans that are interested in participating in COVID-19 related clinical research, whether out of self-interest or altruism, easily can find VHA's single source of truth about COVID-19 related clinical research.

Veterans that are interested in participating in COVID-19 related clinical research can easily signal their interest in participating to VHA and be informed about what will happen next.

## Undesired User Outcomes
Veterans believe they are signing up for a COVID-19 vaccine.

Veterans believe they are signing up for a specific COVID-19 vaccine trial

## Desired Business Outcomes

VHA Office of Research & Development (ORD) is looking to level up their outreach and engagement capabilities in order to meet the needs of COVID-19 clinical studies. Previously, it is our understanding that, while VHA conducts a good bit of research, nothing of this scale has been taken on (i.e. multiple nation-wide clinical studies happening concurrently involving thousands of participants). If we're successful, we'll be able to solve a small part of this leveling up effort: efficient delivering informed, interested Veterans to ORD where they will be further screened and (hopefully) enrolled in one or more studies that will ultimately lead to effective COVID vaccines and therapies.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
Veterans interested in participating in COVID-19 related clinical research are frustrated by initial experience and decline to register their interest and ultimately do not participate.

Breach of trust with interested Veterans. Could be from misaligned expectations, data loss, or mishandled research protocols.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### Notional funnel
- Click through on marketing communications (emails, SMSs, other) to landing page.
- Scroll depth on landing page.
- Click through from landing page to registration form.
- Completion of registration form.
- Responding to follow up screening and enrollment call.
- Begin participation in clinical study.
- Complete participation in clinical study.

#### Qualitative
- NPS score of end to end experience: from learning about the opportunity to completing a clinical study.
- Perceived level of knowledge/understanding of Veterans when being followed up with via phone â€” did the Veteran understand what they signed up for?

#### Quantitative
- Foresee / Medallia feedback score for landing page.
- Funnel metrics (see above).


#### Baseline KPI Values
Unknown.

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
TBD.

## Assumptions
- We assume that Veterans are interested in participating in COVID-19 related clinical research.
- We assume that ORD can handle lots of interested Veterans who want to participate.
- We assume there will be somewhere in ORD that we can programmatically send data that we collect in registration forms.
- We assume that ORD-run contact centers will be able to manage the data we send them.
- We assume that we will not have to deal with PRA review because PRA has a specific exemption for clinical trials.
- We assume the VA.gov Forms System is stable and will be an easy route to creating a simple registration form. 


## Solution Approach

- Evergreen content for marketing / comms.
- Single source of VA.gov truth on COVID-19 research efforts with CTA to sign up ("landing page")
- Registration form
- Push as much of the screening and enrollment process (including informed consent) onto phone/video and rely on people power rather than fancy tech.

## Go-to-market Strategy
- Activate as many channels we have access to in order to get the word out. Includes weekly MHV newsletter (~1M recipients) and targeted VEText blasts.
- Cross link on other VA.gov COVID properties
- Notional launch plan: full "dark" launch (block from indexing, no cross links) and canary-style test by sending out targeted comms to small pilot groups. Once we are confident, activate big comms push and enable cross links. 

## Launch Dates
- *Target Launch Date*
8/21
- *Actual Launch Date* 
TBD
- *What date will you evaluate impact after launch?*
Every day.
