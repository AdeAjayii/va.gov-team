# Coronavirus research volunteer registry

## Giving people the opportunity to participate in important VA coronavirus research

### The Problem

People want to participate in coronavirus clinical trials being administered by VA, but they don’t know how to get started. This new digital tool lets people easily add their name to a registry. VA is particularly interested in reaching out to populations that have been traditionally underrepresented in clinical research.

### The Solution

A new digital tool on VA.gov allows Veterans and non-Veterans to easily add their name to a coronavirus clinical trial registry. To participate, you simply fill out a short questionnaire. The clinical research team at VA will reach out to eligible participants for further evaluation. 

### Tool Features 

VA designed this tool in partnership with VA clinical experts and Veterans.

### How we’re collaborating across the organization to make it easier to find participants for VA clinical trials

This coronavirus research volunteer registry is just one example of the value of VA’s investment in digital modernization and culture of innovation and collaboration. With this tool, VA is making it easier to find and volunteer to particpate in a VA-led clinical trial. 

### What Veterans are saying

VA designed this tool in partnership with VA clinical experts and Veterans (though the registry is also open to non-Veterans).

- “It’s important. Anything to improve the VA is important.”
- “If I can help I want to make others’ lives better.”
- “I assumed everyone would have to be a Veteran. It's pretty cool that anyone can participate.”
- "Hopefully [I will] help myself or others in the same situation.”
- “I liked that it was fast, not 200 questions just to tell me no--ask me the important stuff, I like that it was short.”
- “If you can help other people then why not [volunteer].”


We’ll continue to closely monitor usage, performance, and feedback, and update content and features to meet evolving needs. For questions or to offer feedback, contact us at feedback@va.gov.
