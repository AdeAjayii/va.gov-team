## Communications around authorized vaccines vs. vaccine trials

Concern from beginning: Working with teams that are doing trials to try to make sure that everything is clear. The info that we’re putting out is geared toward vaccines that we’ll be able to give once they get past the EUA. We knew there was going to be confusion and tried our best….but we’re interested in hearing from PAOs about where there might be confusion.

- **PAO question:** We’re part of ENSEMBLE trial. First group of volunteers are going to come from referrals from primary care. But to get the max number of volunteers, we need to promote and recruit from the 75% of the state that we cover. We need to use gov delivery, social media, etc. to reach people. This can confuse people about why they’d want to join a trial if there’s a vaccine.
  - **Answer:** It’s an incredibly dynamic situation. As of right now, the first people that are going to get approved vaccines are going to be HCPS at highest risk followed possibly by those at CLCs, spinal cord facilities, and high risk Veterans. We don’t believe that in these first doses that are going to come to us, we’re going to get to the point where the people you’re trying to reach could get a vaccine today. So that may help with your messaging. But we won’t know anything for sure for another week. So we’ll get back to you. 
- **PAO question from VISN 21:** Are you all differentiating between internal and external communications for vaccine education? 
  - **Answer:** Absolutely. One of the documents early on was a comparison of the flu vaccine vs. the COVID-19 vaccine, and there is one for HCPs, one for employees that aren’t HCPs and Veterans. There’s a Veterans toolkit. There’s an employee toolkit. A lot of the ideas that we get are coming from all of you. So if you see a place where there’s a gap, tell us and we’ll do everything we can to create what you need. 
  - **PAO response:** I’m thinking about the ENSEMBLE trial at some sites. We have vaccines coming and they’re all different. I’ve been struck in conversations with frontline staff that they don’t know the difference…what’s an mRNA vaccine vs. a viral vector, etc. People don’t understand what they are and what the differences are.
  - **Answer:** We met with a communications rep from CDC. They have a video that explains how they were able to shorten the time of getting the vaccine out without cutting corners. We’re going to look at that and put it in the toolkit. The other part is vaccine education…Operation Warp Speed wants us to get that info from them so we have to wait.

## Beneficiary travel

People have raised questions. We’re reaching out to member services to find out if we can develop some consistent messaging that will talk about some of the challenges and what the next steps are. The registration system isn’t talking to the registry system, and it’s causing backups and payment issues.

## More communications questions

- **PAO from Kansas:** The press release that went out – is it actually telling Veterans to call their local VA health facility when we only got the playbook today? Knowing our Vets, those calls will come as soon as the PR hits. 
  - **Answer:** Is the concern that the materials aren’t fully developed? Or that facilities don’t have info? Our call centers are getting lots of calls about vaccines. 
  - **Comments in chat:** Facilities are getting questions on social media, CBOCs are getting calls. Facilities are still planning our vaccine procedures and no date of when they will be available.
  - **Answer:** The press release sends people to the CDC website. 

- **PAO question:** Have Knowledge Management materials been provided to contact centers?
  - **Answer:** Just approved yesterday, and sent up to KM. Info is in the toolkit…For the vaccine that needs to be at -70, they may do a test shifting that…

- **PAO question:** Once the vaccines are approved, the Pfizer one would be shipped to 5 pilot sites?
  - **Answer:** CDC had asked us for a list of 5 sites that had 2 criteria. They already were able to do the cold storage and they were large enough to give out all the doses before they thawed (they come in a big pack). We don’t know if that’s what they’re going to do. In addition, VA is purchasing 2 cold storage freezers per VISN so there will be quickly more facilities that will be able to get that.
