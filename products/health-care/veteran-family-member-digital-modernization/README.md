Who are the users and what do we know about them
What is the problem they are having and why are they having it?
What business outcomes are trying to be achieved by solving for that problem?
With who do we expect the team will need to collaborate with but inside and out of OCTO to solve the problem?
What unique factors exist like legislative pressures or constraints?
What commitments have already been made, to whom, and at what level of fidelity?
What are the biggest known risks?
