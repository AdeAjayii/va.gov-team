# Virtual Care Manager Initiative
Virtual care manager pulls all virtual facing tools for VA clinicians to leverage VA Video Connect from patient care. VCM capabilities allow VA clinicians to create, view, and join video visits from one place and invite other VA staff and Veterans’ families to the visits.

### What We're Working On
- The CDSP team is in queue to support the OCC’s VCM team in the efforts to launch VCM through the patient context in CPRS. The prioritization of this work is pending an executive leadership discussion at the end of April 2022. As it stands, the CDSP team provide an estimate of level of effort required to successfully integrate VCM with CCOW. Details below:
•	Development effort (based on MedPIC implementation)
o	This is work to add VCM to the CDSP container
o	It will take a day for the team to do the integration 
•	Adding the app to CPRS ‘Tools’ menu
o	This is work to trigger VCM from the CPRS 'Tools' menu
o	The Clinical App Coordinator (CAC) needs to add the url to the CPRS ‘Tools’ menu at that location. 
•	Site testing (based on CPM implementation)
o	If the application relies on vitals and lab data, the following is estimated: 
	Support from the CAC to add the vitals, risk factors and test the tool (45-60mins)
	Support from Automated Data Processing Application Coordinator (ADPAC) to add the lab data (10-15mins)
