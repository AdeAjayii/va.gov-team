# Precision Oncology Initiative
This is a national program to find “biomarkers” on cancer cells, targetting patients with advanced stage cancer.  

# About the Product
## North Star Goal 
It aims to help providers match eligible patients with new research therapies for their cancer treatment. 

## User Problem Statement
Provider (any oncologist at the VA) sends tissue or blood samples to lab. Lab sends back a PDF report to the provider that ordered it. On the PDF< some precision treatment suggestions are notes (but hard to see in the PDF). If no precision treatments are available, providers go with conventional treatments.
