# Long COVID Initiative
The Long COVID initiative is to build clinical decision support solutions for Long COVID care to streamline the workflows for clinicians and to enhance engagement with impacted Veterans who may be suffering from Long COVID. 

# About the Product

## User Problem Statement
The current crisis with COVID-19 is unprecedented in modern times. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-care/post-covid-background.html "CDC") and current literature states that anywhere from 5-80% of COVID-19 patients may have long-term symptoms and conditions following their acute COVID infection. These symptoms can range from mild to severely debilitating, requiring further hospitalizations or even death.  

The clinical teams associated with Long COVID programs across VHA struggle with logistical challenges of identifying and tracking patients with the long term effects from COVID-19. There is a desire to have access to COVID-impacted Veterans to screen if they continue to struggle beyond the acute phase of their illness and to prioritize outreach for care to the most struggling regardless of where they are at. There is a high manual and administrative burden clinicians currently face in the outreach, assessment, and clinical care for these patients that can be alleviated with support from existing VA tools and tailored technology.

## North Star Goal 
Our current goal is to enable clinicians to identify, provide outreach, and engage Veterans struggling with long COVID.  The first phase of this effort will be to create a proof of concept Long COVID outreach dashboard. Once value has been demonstrated, the solution would eventually scale across VISNs.

Our North Star goals are to:
* Support clinicians in the ability to identify, communicate with, categorize, monitor trends, and collaborate with veterans experiencing PASC (i.e., long COVID) to improve their quality of life and symptoms by co-creating a Personalized Health Plan based upon veterans' Mission, Aspiration and Purpose (goals of Whole Health) during program participation. 
* Identify known and unknown population of veterans who may be suffering from Long COVID and give clinicians visibility to these veterans so they may proactively manage the engagements as well as prioritize care to the most struggling Veterans
* Educate and provide awareness on Long COVID as a condition to Veterans and explore opportunities to self-report or learn how they may be able to get care at the VA
