## Initial epics and stories for COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and Office of Research Protections, Policy, and Education support

### Epic: Communicating the opportunity

As a veteran interested in participating in COVID-19 related medical research, I want to know whether the VA is involved in any medical research that I might be interested in, and if so, how might I learn more about the medical research and opportunities for me to participate, so I can be better informed and possibly contribute.

As a veteran looking for ways to help out with COVID-19 response, I want to know about any volunteer opportunities that the VA is offering or coordinating in support of COVID-19 response, so I can consider learning more and getting involved.

As a veteran who has repeatedly told the VA to not contact me about research opportunities, I want to make sure I don’t get contacted about COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials, so I don’t have to deal with unwanted and unsolicited messages from the VA.

As a veteran who clearly falls outside the eligibility criteria for a medical research study or clinical trial, I do not want to receive marketing information about these opportunities that I’m not eligible for, so I don’t have to spend time learning about and applying for opportunities that I am not eligible for.

As a veteran that cannot participate in the currently available studies but is still interested in VA studies in general, I’d like to be able to sign up for notifications about future opportunities, so I can stay informed and possibly participate in future studies.

As a veteran without much familiarity with medical research, I want to know what's in it for me and other reasons why I should or should not participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial. 

As a researcher, I want the COVID-19 vaccine trial research to be communicated in such a way that helps us meet enrollment goals as quickly as possible, thereby accelerating the study and potentially resulting in useful findings about a vaccine more quickly. 

### Epic: Learning about the opportunity

As a veteran who wants to help out with COVID-19 response but is not familiar with the medical research or clinical trials processes, I’d like to learn more about what participating in medical research or clinical trial might mean for me, including the amount of time I need to participate, what risks may be involved, how participants are selected, how my information will be used, what safeguards are in place to protect me and my family, and other related information, so I can decide if this is the right kind of opportunity for me.

As a veteran that is not enrolled in VA health care and is interested in participating a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial, I want to know if I will be eligible for treatment at a VA facility for any complications from the vaccine or if that would be handled elsewhere, so I can make an informed decision about whether to participate.

As a veteran who is uncertain about participating in medical research or clinical trials, I’m interested to learn more about other veterans’ experiences participating in these types of activities, so I can determine whether or not it might be something I want to continue looking into and potentially participating.

As a veteran who is interested in a participating in medical research administered by VA, I’d like to know about any current research opportunities that are available, so I can learn more about which opportunities might be appropriate for me.

As a veteran who would like to take part in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial, I need to know if VA is participating in this type of study, and if so, the eligibility criteria for the study, and how I can get started.

As a veteran who received a direct communication (e.g. email, text) about participating in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial, I want to get started with determining my eligibility and submitting my information as quickly as possible, so I can participate with the least amount of process / red tape.

As a veteran that has questions about the eligibility criteria for the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial being administered by VA, I want to be able to easily connect with a human at VA to answer those questions, so can keep moving forward in the process without dealing with ambiguity or seek answers on my own.

### Epic: Preliminary eligibility

As a veteran who has read all of the information VA has offered about the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and is excited about participating, I want to be able to clearly understand whether I’m eligible to participate by providing the least amount of information about myself and, if possible, using data that the VA already knows about me to determine my eligibility automatically.

As a veteran who has read little to none of the information VA has offered about the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials and is excited about participating, I want to be able to gain enough context from the eligibility and enrollment process, so I can better understand any outcomes that might happen from those processes.

As a veteran who is excited about participating in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial, I want to be able to quickly determine my eligibility for the trial and, if the information needed to determine my eligibility is lengthy and involved, make sure that information is stored somewhere, so I can move forward in the enrollment process and I don’t need to fill it again if I’m selected to participate.

As a veteran who has completed the initial eligibility screening process and has been informed that I am eligible to participate, I want to know what I needed to do next in order to participate, so I can keep the process moving.

As a veteran that has trust issues with the VA and the federal government but is still interested in participating in a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial, I don’t want to have to provide any personal information in order to determine whether I am eligible to participate, so I don’t have to worry about what the VA is going to do with my information regardless of the outcome.

As a veteran who often uses VA digital tools, I want to be able to logon and have any of my existing information used to pre-populate any data fields relevent to determining my eligibility to participate. 

As a veteran who primarily uses the internet on my mobile phone, I want to be able to easily interact with any eligibility tool easily on my mobile phone, so I don’t need to find a desktop computer to find out if I’m eligible.

As a research manager that is prioritizing which volunteers we should call back to begin the informed consent process, I need to know basic demographic information about each volunteer including age, sex/gender, location, so I can make sure we’re prioritizing volunteers from underrepresented groups.

As a researcher assistant that is tasked with calling back volunteers who have met initial eligibility criteria, I want those initial eligibility criteria to have enough clarity and specificity to avoid me wasting time calling volunteers who end up not actually being eligible on further questioning. 

### Epic: Informed consent workflow and experience

As a veteran who has determined that I am eligible for the VA’s COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial and wants to participate, I want to know exactly what my status is, so I can determine if I should plan to participate or not and plan my life accordingly.

As a veteran who has a good number of questions and concerns about my participation in the VA’s COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial, I want to know that there is a human at VA that can take as much time as needed to answer all of my questions and concerns before I consent to participate, so I can feel confident that I know what I’m getting myself into.

As an eligible veteran who has a limited amount of time and a high risk tolerance and trusts the VA, I want to be able to move through the informed consent process as quickly as possible, so I can check the box and get back to my day.

As an eligible veteran who prefers to communicate in a language other than English, I want to know that there is a human at the VA that can discuss my questions and concerns about participating in the vaccine clinical trial in the language of my choice, so I can be sure that I am accurately informed before consenting to participate.

As a research assistant that is contacting a prospective participant to walk through the informed consent process, I want to know a minimum of information about the participant, such as their first name, location, and time of day when I should contact them, so I can provide a more personalized experience.

As a veteran that is engaged in the informed consent process, I want to be able to view and save the documents I am discussing with the VA representative over the phone/video, so I can read them at my own pace and review them later.

As a veteran who just completed the informed consent process over the phone/video, I want to know exactly what the next step is in my COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial process, so I can know how to plan and prepare.

As a veteran who was initially interested in participating but has now decided against it, I want to be able to opt out of future communications about this study. 

### Epic: VAMC visit

As an eligible veteran who has completed the informed consent process over the phone/video, I want to be able to reference that consent easily when I visit a VAMC to receive my trial treatment, so I don’t have to go through the entire informed consent process again.

As a research assistant that is processing veterans arriving at a VAMC to receive trial treatment, I want to be able to easily find out whether each veteran has completed the informed consent process previously and verify that consent was given, so I don’t have to administer the informed consent process again unnecessarily and don’t inadvertently provide trial treatment to a veteran that has not completed the informed consent process.
