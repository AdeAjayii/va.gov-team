# VA Online Scheduling (VAOS) Product Outline
---

## Overview
VA online scheduling (VAOS) is a Veteran-facing healthcare appointment scheduling tool on VA.gov.  VAOS allows veterans to view upcoming and past appointments, directly schedule appointments, requests VA and Community Care appointments, and cancel appointments.

The VAOS applicatoin running on VA.gov was released to Veterans in March 2020 through a phased rollout.  The tool was gradually released until 100 percent of veterans were using VAOS on VA.gov.  As of March 18, 2021 the VAOS application is fully availale to all veterans on VA.gov.

## Problem Statement
A very small percentage of Veteran appointments with VA Medical Centers are scheduled online. Other avenues for scheduling appointments like phone, secure messaging, reminder letters, and return to clinic orders can lead to clerical errors, miscommunications, and a heavier burden for schedulers. These issues cause delays in scheduling care and are frustrating for Veterans.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- VAOS is the first place veterans go to view and manage their VA appointments
- Reduce confusion and simplify the appointment scheduling process for veterans
- Create a seemless and positive experience for any Veteran who wants to schedule an appointment online

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Veterans require knowledge of VA processes and rules in order to use VAOS
- Veterans encounter dead ends and can't complete scheduling tasks using VAOS
- Veterans require assistance or are frustrated when using VAOS

## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
