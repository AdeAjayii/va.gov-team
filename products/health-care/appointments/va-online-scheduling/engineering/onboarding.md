# Onboarding

Welcome to VAOS! More specifically, the VAOS-R team. The VAOS-R team is comprised of a front end engineering and back end engineering set of disciplines, a research / design discipline, and product development. Our team is dependent on other teams as part of the VAOS suite of products.

## What is VAOS?

## What is VSP (Veteran Services Platform)

Not to be confused by another commonly heard version of this acronym (Veteran Scheduling Provider).

## How do I contribute?

Depending on your role, you will be called upon to contribute in a variety of ways. These include participating in daily standup/scrum ceremonies, bi-weekly sprint planning, bi-weekly backlog grooming, and other meetings as well as contributions you make as part of your role specific respobsibilities.

We use a combination of Github and JIRA. Most of our issues and backlog will always be captured in Github, but occaisonally we might have tickets created in JIRA for our downstream partners to whom we are beholden for changes in the underlying services layer we consume. Familiarity with Github, opening issues, and Zenhub (our swim-lane kanban style integration with Github) are required.

### Getting Access to Github and JIRA

Please provide Kam or Lenae the following:
  - Github account user profile you wish to use.
  - VA.gov email address as well as email address you wish to have associated for your JIRA account.
  - SSH public key generated for use that is specific to the laptop or GFE you will be using (this can be sent using secure channels such as keybase).
  
### Getting started with local stack (engineers)

First familiarize yourself with the high level overview of best practices for your respective engineering discipline:

Front End Onboarding Guide
Back End Onboarding Guide

Next you'll want to get your local stack setup. Front engineers will most likely need both the backend and the frontend stacks available. It's advisable to have both of these setup though for all disciplines. Instructions and additional resources for contributing to the platform can be found here:

### Internal Tools

There are a variety of internal tools we use for performance, monitoring, tracability of errors, and analytics. Access to many of these tools is restricted. As a developer on the platform it is highly advised that you get access to these systems. Follow the guide available here to request access if your manager has not already requested access on your behalf.
