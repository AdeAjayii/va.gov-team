## DT comments and changes

**Comments:**
- VA now only offers Pfizer or Moderna, so all vaccines VA offers now require 2 doses.
- Certain people with weakened immune systems may need 3 doses. 
- We can break up/shorten the questions CTA.

**Suggested revision:**

Here's what you should know:
- You'll need to get 2 doses for the vaccine to be fully effective. We'll schedule your second appointment while you're here for your first dose.
- Certain people with weakened immune systems may need an additional third dose. Your health care provider will tell you if you need a third dose.
