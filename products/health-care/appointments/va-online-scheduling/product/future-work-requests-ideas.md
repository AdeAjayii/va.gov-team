  # Stakeholder input:
## High Level User Story / Problem / Opportunity
When Veterans are scheduling an appointment, I want to Veteran to schedule with Resident physician instead of Attending physician because approx 80% of veterans are seen by their Resident doctor. 

- In a medical facility, the physician who has the major responsibility for a patient's care is called the attending physician. A resident physician is supervised by an Attending physician
- Each PACT has at least one Attending physician and potentially multiple resident physicians
- For PACT, need to understand if current configuration in VistA allows for this


## Goals / Outcomes
- Is the goal to decrease time in scheduling process for Scheduling managers? *Need input*
