# Manual-UI Test Plan - Appointment List Redesign 

## Project Summary Epic [#38062](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vaos-team-603fdef281af6500110a1691/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/38062) 
Looking to improve the user experience in VAOS by updating the appointment list page to help the veterans view their upcoming appointments, pending apppointments and past appointments. The goal is to have the VAOS appointments list show the same information and value as the equivalent list in MyHealtheVet.

## Business Rule 
On the VAOS homepage, the app displays the following for each status: 
- Upcoming appointments: displays up to 13 months for future booked VA and Community Care appointments including canceled booked appointments
- Pending requests: displays up to 120 days of pending VA and Community Care appointment requests and VA and Community Care canceled requests 
- Past appointments: displays
