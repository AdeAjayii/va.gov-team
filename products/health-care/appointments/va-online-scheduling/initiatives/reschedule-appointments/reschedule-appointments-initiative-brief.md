# Initiative Brief - Reschedule Appointments
## Overview

Currently on VAOS, there isn't functionality to reschedule an appointment. A Veteran may be able to cancel a booked appointment if facility configurations allow for it.
 
---

## Outcome Summary

A user can update a booked VA appointment and leave the interaction with a new booked appointment for a different date and/or time.

- Dependent on [Homepage Refresh](homepage-refresh-initiative-2021.md) rollout 

## Problem
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
  - To reschedule an appointment, a user must cancel their appointment and go through the full flow to create a new appointment.
  - In many cases, the original appointment is not available for direct scheduling online.
  - There's a risk that a user cancels an appointment and can't reschedule the same kind of appointment due.
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
  - Current functionality
  - Anecdotal feedback from stakeholders
  - Qualitative feedback from surveys
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?

  <q>
    Wanted to reschedule an annual appointment to a year from now, as it isn't needed this year.  System says, I cannot reschedule without cancelling first, so I did. Now the only open appointment options are within a few months, so now, I must add to confusion to reschedule a cancelled appointment
  </q></p>
  
  <q>
    I needed to reschedule appontment with PMand R because of symptoms and options were only cancel and no reschedule or ability to describe nature for cancel.

## Desired User Outcomes
- A user can book the same appointment for a different time

## Undesired User Outcomes
- A user cancels a booked appointment and can't schedule a new one (i.e. user leaves with 0 appointments)
- A user reschedules an appointment and the original appointment is not canceled (i.e. user has 2 of the same appointment)

## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Undesired Business Outcomes


## Key Decisions
- It is more preferable for a user to have 2 of the same appointments booked instead of 0 appointments (discussed with Dr. Murphy in PI Planning)
