# VAOS Reschedule Appointments - Initiative Brief

## Overview
Currently on VAOS, a Veteran can cancel an open request or booked appointment (if facility configurations allow for it). If a Veteran wants to reschedule an appointment, they must cancel their appointment and go through the full flow to create a new appointment.

In this two-step process, there's a risk that a Veteran cancels an appointment and can't reschedule the same kind of appointment due to facility configurations.

### Desired Outcomes
- A Veteran can book the same appointment at a different time.

### Undesired Outcomes
- A Veteran can't book the same appointment.

  <q>
    Wanted to reschedule an annual appointment to a year from now, as it isn't needed this year.  System says, I cannot reschedule without cancelling first, so I did. Now the only open appointment options are within a few months, so now, I must add to confusion to reschedule a cancelled appointment
