# Research Goals
Veterans schedule and manage their appointments in various ways, that include in person, by phone or online through the VAOS portal. A veteran can log onto VA.gov and enter the VAOS portal to schedule, request or cancel an appointment as well as view upcoming, past or pending appointments. The focus of this research was to validate the design change decisions, to improve veterans overall experience with VAOS appointment management.
[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)

The purpose of this research is to: 
1. Evaluate usability and value of the appointment list redesign.
2. Test a concept for changes to the appointments details page.



# Research Questions

1. Evaluate usability and value of the appointment list redesign.
- Can appointments be found by:
  - Date/Time?
  - Modality?
  - VA vs CC?
- Do the type of care and provider name make sense in the list?
- Does “Pending” and “Past” language make sense?
  - Are Pending and Past appointments easy to navigate to?
- Are the details pages easy to navigate to?
- Can participants easily understand the meaning of modality in the appointment list - do they understand where they need to be?
- Do Veterans need a physical print “button”?
- What would Veterans do next after viewing their appts in the list?
2. Test a concept for changes to the appointments details page.
- Is the information on the details pages:
  - Easy to understand?
  - Easy to scan?
- Does the back button on the details page make sense?


# Methodology 

We ran a moderated usability test on the appointments list redesign.
This test included 2 versions of the appointments list:
- Mobile
- Desktop

# Location

Remote, over Zoom

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

## Outcomes
We will use the findings to:

  - TRUE: All participants were able to easily scan the new appointment list. 
- The new appointment list will provide clear, valuable information to the veteran
  - TRUE: All participants found the information provided in the new appointment list to be useful and pertinent. 
- The new modality language and iconography will clearly indicate to veterans where they will need to attend their appointments.
  - FALSE: Several veterans found the modality icon and language confusing.
- The new details pages will provide clear, valuable information to the veteran
  - TRUE: All participants found that the new details pages provided useful informationl. 
- The new details pages will be easy for veterans to navigate and scan.
  - TRUE: All participants were able to navigate the new details pages with ease.
- The back button (in place of breadcrumb) will be easy for veterans to locate and use.
  - TRUE: Veterans found the back button easily and were able to navigate using it. 


# Key Findings
1. **All users (10 of 10)** were able to **scan through the appointment list** by date, time, status and type of care. 
- Many users wanted the reason for appointment to be displayed on the appointment list. 
- Users expressed an interest in access to secure messaging from the appointment list. 

2. **A number of users (4 of 10)** struggled to **differentiate between modality** icons - specifically the types of video appointments.

(Note: Outcomes would have differed if details pages were consistent with appointment list items.

3. **The majority of users (8 of 10)** reported that they **would not print** their appointments from VAOS. 
- **All users (10 of 10)** reported using other **digital methods** to manage their appointments. 

4. **Most users (9 of 10)** clicked on the **past appointments** link without assistance from facilitator. 

- **The majority of users (8 of 10) did not click on the correct appointment** when asked to locate their **most recent** appointment. 

5. **All users (10 of 10) found the details pages easy** to navigate and the information easy to find. 
- Users wanted **phone number ext, providers name, help number** and **“join now”** button added.
- Some users noted that the **only two CTA’s were to cancel or reschedule** with no other options. 
- Users wanted to know the reason for canceled appointments. 


# Details of Findings and Recommendations

## 1. Appointment list was easy for users to scan for information.

All users (10 of 10) were able to scan through the appointment list and identify the following: 
- **Date** - What day the appointments will take place and are grouped by. 
- **Time** - What time the appointment will take place
- **Status** - Is the appointment canceled?
- **Provider** - Who is the appointment with?
- **Type of care** - What is the appointment for? (ie: primary care, sleep medicine, mental health)

   _“Looks like my [type of care] appointment is at [Date] and [Time]. It’s pretty explanatory and looks fairly simple. I see one appointment here has been canceled since it’s lined out, appointment with [provider].”_  
   
   -Participant 15  

4 participants wanted the reason for appointment to be displayed on the appointment list as a way of reminding them what the appointment was for. This comment came prior to viewing appointment details, which lists the reason for the appointment (if provided) there.

The above image shows the screen in the scheduling flow where veterans select one of four reasons an appointment would be scheduled, and a comment box for additional details. This is displayed in the details pages. 

## 2. Some participants did not understand modality. 
A number of users (4 of 10) struggled to differentiate between the different modality icons. When asked to read through and interpret an appointment on the appointment list, one participant assumed that the building icon (for video appointment at VA) was a prototype error. At least 4 participants reported that they had never heard of a video appointment that took place at a facility. 

**Note:** The primary focus of this study was the appointment list. The prototype only showcased a select number of details page types. The participants may have had a different experience if when they clicked on an appointment, the information on the details pages matched that of the appointment they clicked on. Four participants clicked on the details for a video appointment at a facility and were routed to a video appointment at home, giving them no additional information on how a video appointment at a facility would be conducted. Outcomes may have differed had the details pages been consistent with appointment list items. 

   _“I don't know why that [appointment] video is showing a building. On the second, it shows a camera and this one's a building. So that's a little confusing.”_
   -Participant 15  

   _“I see this video appointment with a VA device. I'm not sure what that would be. I guess if they gave me a device in person at [medical center]. So it's a video appointment, but I'd have to go to [medical center] to use the video?”_   
   -Participant 7  
   
**Recommendation: Simplify the usage of modality language.**

Revisit the language and iconography, indicating where a person should attend their appointment. There was confusion around appointment modality. It is suggested that simplifying this will help mitigate that confusion.  
   
## 3. The majority of users would not print their appointment list. 

Most of the users (8 of 10) reported that they would not want to print an individual appointment or list. When asked what they would do alternatively, all users (10 of 10) reported using these digital methods to reference their appointments:

- Three (3 of 10) users said they use email to reference their upcoming appointments. 
- Six (6 of 10) users reported that they use their digital calendar to reference their appointments. 
- One user said they take a photo of their appointment and keep it in their phone to reference their appointment. 
 
   “I get emails and I save those rather than print it.”  
   -Participant 5  

   “No, I don't [print] cause when I go they usually give me print out, and when I get home I just put it in my [digital] calendar.”  
   -Participant 15  

**Recommendation: No print all link**

Because the majority of participants reported that they do not print their appointments, consider leaving the print link out of the appointment list.

**Recommendation: Add all to calendar**

With the majority of participants reporting that they used their digital calendar as a way of managing their appointments, it is suggested that adding a link to "add all to calendar
