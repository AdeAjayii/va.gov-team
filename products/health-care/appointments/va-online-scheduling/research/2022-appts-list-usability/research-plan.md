[DRAFT] Research plan for VAOS appointments list usabilty test
=============

Background
----------

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

The VA Online Scheduling and MyHealtheVet teams worked together to identify gaps between scheduling features in the two products. They completed an analysis [to identify gaps](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/HealthApartment/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B24A0A2A8-279E-42D1-B0E4-3C1C8EF5D5F5%7D&file=MHV%2BVAOS%20Gap%20analysis%20recommendations.docx&wdOrigin=OFFICECOM-WEB.MAIN.SEARCH&ct=1656340079030&action=default&mobileredirect=true) between the two products. Then, the VAOS team [tested a design concept](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/2022-MHV%2BVAOS-appts-list-discovery/report-MHV%2BVAOS-appts-list-discovery.md) that would meet the needs identified in the gap analysis.

The VAOS team also wants to evaluate potential changes to the appointment details page content and navigation.

Building on those activities, this research will evaluate:

-   The usability of the redesigned appointment list
-   A redesign concept for the appointment list detail pages

Also see [Product's initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/appointment-list/product-outline-appointment-list-2022.md).

### OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase ðŸ“ˆ

-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an appointments list that meets Veteran expectations and needs.

Decrease ðŸ“‰

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

-   MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

-   MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs

-   MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

-   Maintaining my emotional health

-   Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring

-   MTM: Taking care of my health

-   MTM: Managing my declining health

Research goals
--------------

1.  Evaluate usability and value of the appointment list redesign.

2.  Test a concept for changes to the appointments details page.

### Outcome

We will use the findings to:

-   Finalize designs and update the appointments list.Â 
  
-   Decide on next steps for redesigning the details pages.

### Hypotheses

The appointments list will:
-   Provide clear, valuable information
-   Be easy to navigate

The details pages will:
-   Provide clear, valuable information.
-   Be easy to navigate.


Method
------

We'll run a moderated usability test on the appointments list redesign.

This test will include 3 versions of the appointments list:
-   Mobile
-   Desktop
-   Screen-reader (TBD)

### Location

Remote, over Zoom.

### Research materials

Recruitment
-----------

### Recruitment approach

Perigean will recruit 15 total participants for this study. We will ask Perigean to treat each of three groups as a separate recruitment effort: mobile, desktop, and screenreader users [TBD - we may cut screenreader portion].

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria**

Please consider each of the following 3 groups as a separate recruitment effort.

Desktop users:
-  5 participants who primarily use a desktop/laptop computer.
-  All participants must be able to attend sessions on their desktop/laptop computer.

Mobile users:
-  5 participants who primarily use a tablet or other mobile device.
-  All participants must be able to attend sessions on a mobile device.

Screenreader users: [TBD - may cut screenreader portion]
-  5 participants who primarily use a screenreader.
-  All participants must be able to attend sessions while using a screenreader.

**Secondary criteria:**

[TODO add demographic screening criteria - Ciera to fill out]
