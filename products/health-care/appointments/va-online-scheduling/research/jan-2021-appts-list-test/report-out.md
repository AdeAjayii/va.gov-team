# January 2021 VAOS appointments usability study [DRAFT]

## Background

## Methodology

## Participants

## Results summary

All participants were able to complete most of the main tasks we tested with ease, and often did so without any prompting. See task-level details on the table below. This gives us a high confidence that this feature will be usable by most veterans.

That said, there were some problem areas that we’ll focus on later in this report:

* Appointment requests continue to be confusing.
* Language used in the booking notes could be clearer

*Fig.1 - Usability results*

**Quotes**
>  I like the way the appointments are broken into a bubble. Before it use to be a table and it was written out.  I like that the appointments are in order and I can just click on it to see what it is. And then see it is a phone appointment instead of searching through 3 pages to see I have appointments. -P3
>  I like that Express Care here has a phone and that tells me it is a phone appointment and this other one tells me it is a video appointment so I don’t need to drive for it -P3
> Cancelled appointment should tell you who cancelled it and when you click on it, it tells you. There are times that appointments are cancelled and I don’t know who did. It is nice that they have you cancelled it so I can think back to see why I cancelled it. Or if I click it and it says the va cancelled and gives a date and number. -P3

## Results



Note that while a small study like this works well for validating usability, the opportunities below should be further researched and validated before action is taken.

### Appointment requests continue to create confusion

Most users had a little difficulty to find and understand the appointment requests section, and one user couldn't at all.

Once in the request, most users wanted more information about the status of the request. Specifically, whether a scheduler has viewed the request, and if so, whether they have started processing it. Participants reported that they will call their facility if the request sits for too long.

While participants were able to navigate through the three requests displayed, it wasn't clear that appointment requests were in order of date requested, as that information isn't shown.

**Opportunities**
* Adding clarity around the status of requests might help reduce phone calls by creating more transparency about where a request is in the process. Veterans are calling facilities to get information on their requests, so even knowing if it has been reviewed could be helpful.
* Make it easier to direct schedule video and phone appointments before changing to a request flow.

**Recommendations**
* Make the "Requested" title more specific. "Pending" or "Pending request" might be better.
* Add a note to the requests list explaining that they are in order with the oldest requests at the top.

**Quotes**
> It would be nice to see if someone on the other side said they saw \[the appointment request\]. If I requested and they haven’t responded just show me that. - P2
> \[Looking at the list of appointment requests\] Primary care is at the top because everything goes through primary care and specialty would be in ABC order or when the appointments are. This is February. It must be in ABC order; they must be in alphabetical order. - Pe

### The need to see the Type of Care associated with an appointment only came up indirectly

We were surprised that few participants directly asked about type of care. From previous research[ADD LINK] we believed this would be a pain point. Some of that may have been due to the test though. Most participants quickly skimmed the initial calendar page before opening an appointment. Some participants noticed that “Primary care” was mentioned in the booking note, and commented that they were happy to see that there, not realizing that’s what they would have entered.

**Quotes**
 

### Booking notes language wasn't clear

Most veterans showed some confusion when looking at the information they would have entered, such as booking note, time preferences on requests, or contact information. Part of this was due to the test - likely this would be more recognizable if it was the veteran’s own language or words. 

### Veterans plan future appointments by looking at the past
Most participants said they often want to back at past appointments to find previous appointment dates so they could schedule future appointments. They also initially underestimated how far back they'd like to see past appointments. Most started at six months and decided later that seeing apointments a year or more back would help them plan for future repeat appointments.

Some participants also refer to their records of past appointments to find facility contact information.

**Opportunities**
* One step toward personalization might be to surface CTAs to schedule recurring appointments, like yearly physicals, on the home page.
* Provide a list of recent health care providers, and allow Veterans to schedule new appointments with them, saving the step of choosing a Type of Care or facility.

**Quotes**
> If I need to schedule my yearly physical or get blood work I would look at my personal calendar. I know it's been longer than 3 months. - P2

### A record of canceled appointments would help Veterans feel in control

Participants reported that seeing who canceled an appointment, and when, would help them make better choices around providers. For example, if one facility keeps canceling an appt, the Veteran may decide to go elsewhere. 

In addition, participants wanted some direction as to the next steps after an appointment is canceled. Will the doctor follow up? Should they?

**Quotes**
> It's happened where all my appointments were cancelled for a month and a half. If it's cancelled by me that’s one thing but if it was cancelled by them I would expect a physical call and reschedule on their part. - P2
>I schedule around work - like going in late or leaving early. If I take a day off and they cancel it I am SOL. Trying to reschedule it is a bit of a pickle. - P2


### Self-rescheduling is empowering
Participants were excited about the ability to easily reschedule.


**Recommendations**
* Add a confirmation screen before the reschedule is complete
* Add a temporary indicator to the appointment thumbnail that the appt has been rescheduled
* One participant wanted to reschedule canceled appts. This could be an option on the detail page.

**Quotes**
> I hope to reschedule it doesn’t take you to a year out but to the next available appointment. - P3
    
### Static landing page
* All users quickly found the main CTA
* Most skimmed the content quickly then moved on without prompting. It was difficult to keep them on the page
* Some commented that they see the COVID notification everywhere on VA, so just skip it.

**Quotes**
> Let me reread it. I am guessing I can make an appointment or request one here. I am not sure. - P2
> The first time I read this but now I just click on the blue button. Most of the time on the VA if it is in blue you can click it and get somewhere else. - P3
> Every page starts with COVID stuff but no one reads that anymore. -P3


### General scheduling feedback
Veterans also provided general feedback about their scheduling experience. These build on themes we’ve heard earlier.

Participants wanted to know any other information to help them prepare for the day of the appointment, such as if labs/fasting would be needed.

Some participants reported that the process for getting travel pay reimbursed is tedious. They have to put in a reimbursement request after every trip to an appointment , and the wait times for reimbursement were long.

As we've heard in previous sessions, wait times for requests are too long. And creating a request through VAOS is slower than calling, which has caused them to use VAOS less.

About half of the participants were aware of VAOS, but don’t use it because of issues scheduling in the past, including facilities not being available.

**Opportunities**
* Look for ways to integrate travel pay reimbursement into appointments.
* A waitlist option might be helpful

**Quotes**
> It's 'hurry up and wait' in the military from bootcamp to waiting for appointments. - P2
> I would hope \[to get a call back from a request\] within a day but the earliest I've gotten a call back was maybe 2 days. - P2
> Some appointments I can schedule using myhealthevet.gov. Others I have to call like ten thousand times to make an appointment. Others they just make for me and send me a card and tell me I am there. - P3
> The biggest problem is you call and it keeps ringing especially for the specialty clinics - you can spend 3 days on the phone trying to get an appointment. It's not their fault they are understaffed and overworked. I understand that because I work Veterans. - P3
> I used to take my appointment summary to the VA and they would \[put in the travel pay reimbursement\]. But now I have to scan it and redo it and wait for it to be rejected and appeal it and it takes almost a year to get paid. They reject it regularly. - P3
> I have been waiting a month for a rotator cuff tear. You have to wait for the community care permission which takes a month then wait for the space. It needs to be streamlined, there are too many ways to fail. - P3
> I have used this page before. It is how I have scheduled appointments but the place I go doesn’t have many appointment available. And since COVID you can't make an appointment. When you try to schedule online they make you call to schedule. - P3
> I needed an appointment within 6 months and that was last February and I was just seen last week. By the time that they see the request and get it in the computer it is already 6 months out. - P3
> Say I had an appointment Monday but I have class. I would say I need to reschedule but they tell me there’s no time within the next 3 months. I would not have a choice to take it because I was supposed to be seen. You would have to call every day to see if there are openings for the next day. It would be nice if you put something on here to be put on a waitlist and out your dates. If your name is at the top they could slide you in and be seen.


### Appointment reminders are inconsistent
Most users reported some issue around the volume of notifications (including text, email, phone, and paper) they receive from the VA. Sometimes there are too many, sometimes none, and often it varies based on the provider.

The content of the notifications they receive is generally helpful, though one user reported that sometimes the phone numbers are incorrect.

Most users track their appointments across multiple systems: desk calendar, email, digital calendar, etc. Some create additional reminders for their appointments. Others rely on a calendar they review daily.

**Quotes**
> I have Outlook on my phone and I track it there. I have reminders two weeks out and the day of. It tells me what time I need to leave. And I have it written on the desk calendar. - P3
>Last month I had an appointment and I got \[no notification\]. I almost forgot but my phone reminded me. The clinic is three hours away. 
The Veterans I help \[with transport\] are in their 80’s. It's a two-day trip; we take them there for their appointments and drive back the next day. - P3


> Text message reminders are fine if it's maybe one the week of, and one the day before. But sometimes I end up getting 15 texts that are all the same message and makes me confirm or cancel it.  It just gets very annoying after awhile. - P3
