# January 2021 VAOS appointments usability study [DRAFT]

## Background

## Methodology

## Participants

## Results summary

All participants were able to complete most of the main tasks we tested with ease, and often did so without any prompting. See task-level details on the table below. This gives us a high confidence that this feature will be usable by most veterans.

That said, there were some problem areas that we’ll focus on later in this report:

* Appointment requests continue to be confusing.
* Language used in the booking notes could be clearer

*Fig.1 - Usability results*

## Results

### Appointment requests continue to create confusion

One user couldn’t find them at all, and others struggled. 

Recommendations

* Look at language. Maybe there’s a better way to phrase these.
* Be more transparent about where a request is in the process. Veterans are calling facilities to get information on their requests, so even knowing if it has been reviewed would be helpful.
* Make it easier for veterans to direct schedule video and phone appointments. 

We were surprised that few participants directly asked about type of care. From previous research[ADD LINK] we believed this would be a pain point. Some of that may have been due to the test though. Some participants noticed that “Primary care” was mentioned in the booking note, and commented that they were happy to see that there, not realizing that’s what they would have entered.

### Booking notes language wasn't clear

Most veterans showed some confusion when looking at the information they would have entered, such as booking note, time preferences on requests, or contact information. Part of this was due to the test - likely this would be more recognizable if it was the veteran’s own language or words. 

### Veterans plan future appointments by looking at the past
Most participants said they often want to back at past appointments to find previous appointment dates so they could schedule future appointments. 

Also useful for finding contact info.

This is a step toward personalizations.

Recordkeeping canceled appointments is important for a couple of reasons. If one facility keeps canceling an appt, the veteran may decide to go elsewhere. In addition to what we showed, participants wanted some transparency into the next steps. Will the doctor follow up? Should they?

**Opportunities**
* Surface appointments veterans need to make regularly on the home page. If appointments happen yearly

### Self-rescheduling is empowering
Participants were excited about the ability to easily reschedule	

Recommendations
* Add a confirmation screen before the reschedule is complete
* Add a temporary indicator to the appointment thumbnail that the appt has been rescheduled
* One participant wanted to reschedule canceled appts. This could be an option on the detail page.
    
    
### Static landing page
* All users quickly found the main CTA
* Most skimmed the content quickly then moved on without prompting. It was difficult to keep them on the page
* Some commented that they see the COVID notification everywhere on VA, so just skip it.


### General scheduling feedback
Veterans also provided general feedback about their scheduling experience. These build on themes we’ve heard earlier

The process for getting travel pay reimbursed is tedious.

About half of the participants were aware of VAOS, but don’t use it because of issues scheduling in the past, including facilities not being available.
