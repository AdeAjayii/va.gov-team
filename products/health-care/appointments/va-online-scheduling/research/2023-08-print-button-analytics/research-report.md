You need to be able to print out a list so that it can easily be added to a calendar and/or given to caregivers to add to their calendars.

I cannot print my appointments and I get signed out every time I change to a different appointment.  Horrible experience.

Find and print all VA appointments on a single sheet. I did not find where any this function was available. This helps me to see the overall picture of upcoming appointments. If this function is not available it would be nice to have.

Tried to print my appointments. The kiosks have been taken away at the VA. Continuously coming up with ways to inconvenience the veterans so the VA can save money is why we commit suicide. You people don't give a fuck about us.

I only had five  small appointments.  Why did the font's  printout "Extra Large"  take up an ENTIRE page.  I would have given you a very satisfied MARK instead of  the Neither satisfied Mark.
