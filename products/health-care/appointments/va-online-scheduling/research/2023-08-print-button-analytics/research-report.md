# Print Button Analytics and Feedback [Draft]

## Background

On 08/02/2023 the VAOS team released a feature for users to print their appointments list. This added a print button the the appointment lists using a new tertiary style. To assess the usability of the style and whether it's meeting a need, we will gather user behavior data and feedback from Medallia for one month after the release.

## Findings

**Immediately on release, users started clicking the print button.** Desktop users clicked it the most often, and most users printed the upcoming appointments page. This falls into our expectations with the print button. We believe this to indicate that the print button is findable/usable.

**August was the first month in 2023 where no users left comments related to printing.** We believe that, because medallia feedback tends to the negative, receiving no feedback is an indicator that the print button is meeting the intended need.

## Next steps

We plan to follow up with UAT that will test at this button's usability, along with other features.

## Google Analytics Usage Data
Veterans immediately started using the print button when it was released on 08/02/2023. Clicks started that day and continued at a steady pace throughout the month, averaging between 1-200 per day.

Veterans on desktop computers were the biggest users, followed by tablet and mobile.

## Comparative usage

The Print button was clicked about x% as often as the "Start scheduling" button, which is one of the most-often used features in VAOS.

Find and print all VA appointments on a single sheet. I did not find where any this function was available. This helps me to see the overall picture of upcoming appointments. If this function is not available it would be nice to have.

Tried to print my appointments. The kiosks have been taken away at the VA. Continuously coming up with ways to inconvenience the veterans so the VA can save money is why we commit suicide. You people don't give a fuck about us.

I only had five  small appointments.  Why did the font's  printout "Extra Large"  take up an ENTIRE page.  I would have given you a very satisfied MARK instead of  the Neither satisfied Mark.
