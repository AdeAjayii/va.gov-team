Veterans on desktop computers were the biggest users, followed by tablet and mobile.

## Comparative usage

Compared to the "Start scheduling" button, which is one of the most-often used features in VAOS, the Print feature was clicked about 3% as often as "Start scheduling":

Find and print all VA appointments on a single sheet. I did not find where any this function was available. This helps me to see the overall picture of upcoming appointments. If this function is not available it would be nice to have.

Tried to print my appointments. The kiosks have been taken away at the VA. Continuously coming up with ways to inconvenience the veterans so the VA can save money is why we commit suicide. You people don't give a fuck about us.

I was unable to print my February appoinment . Also the login is to involved and you keep changing it!  I am also a patient at Mass. The VA should copy their system.

print  
Were you able to do your task today?

(NEG)  
I only had five  small appointments.  Why did the font's  printout "Extra Large"  take up an ENTIRE page.  I would have given you a very satisfied MARK instead of  the Neither satisfied Mark.
