# Research Plan for [Team, Product, Date]

## Background
VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

- What problem is your product trying to solve?

- What is Veteransâ€™ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?
