# Facilities personalization research plan [DRAFT]

## Hypotheses

We believe that Veterans who are able to choose from the facilities where they currently receive care will be able to complete the facility selection step faster than Veterans who do not.
* We may not be able to test this in this initial round
* Maybe focus on ease over speed

We believe that Veterans who have chosen a facility where they receive care will complete the facilities page more often than those who havenâ€™t.

We believe that Veterans will understand that "save a facility" in VAOS means they will be able to choose that facility more easily the next time they schedule.

## Research questions

| Research question | Interview question(s) |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| How do Veterans think about facilities where they currently receive care, compared to those where they are registered? | - Where do you generally receive VA care? <br> - Where are you registered to receive care? <br> - (If they don't know) How would you expect to find out where you're registered? |
| How would it be helpful (if at all) for Veterans find it helpful to know where they are registered? | (Show the registered facilities list) In what situations would you want to know this information, outside of scheduling appointments? |  
| In what ways would it be helpful for a Veteran to manually control which facilities where they currently receive care; or do they expect VA to "just know" this information? | |
| How often do Veterans have multiple VA facilities they go to for the same type of care? Different types of care? | Do you go to the same VA facility for all of your medical appointments? |


## Participants

### Primary criteria
- Must have VA health care

### Secondary criteria
- Ideal to test with Veterans who have visited multiple VA facilities (maybe even in multiple states, and over many years - e.g. had health care through the VA for X+ years? Interestingly if we add a year/timeframe criteria like that we will automatically get an older population)
