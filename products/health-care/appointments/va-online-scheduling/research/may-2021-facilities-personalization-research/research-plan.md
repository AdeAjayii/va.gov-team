# Facilities personalization research plan [DRAFT]

## Goals	

### What product & team are you doing this research for?	

This research is a collaboration between two products/teams:
- Profile "My VA health facilities", Authenticated Experience
- Choose your VA health facility, VA Online Scheduling

### Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The VAOS (online scheduling) tool allows Veterans to make an appointment at all of the facilities at which they're registered, but Veterans are frustrated because being registered at a facility does not mean they are currently receiving care there. Veterans are still considered registered at facilities where they used to receive — but no longer receive — care, and at some facilities for reasons other than having ever been a patient. Therefore, Veterans see facilities in VAOS that they don't go to, and they do not understand why they are being asked to make appointments at facilities they don't go to. This has resulted in a considerable amount of complaints. 

The Authenticated Experience MVP will add functionality to VA.gov profile to allow Veterans to set their facility preferences, which will in turn inform the list of options Veterans see when they use VAOS to schedule an appointment online. User goals, business goals, and assumptions are listed in the [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/preferred-facility/README.md)

The VAOS MVP will allow Veterans to save facilities where they regularly receive care, so they can quickly select them on subsequent visits.

### Our approach

We'll run an interview + usability study to get feedback from Veterans, and validate two flows:
- From profile to VAOS
- from VAOS to profile

Half of the participants will see the flow starting at the profile; the other half will start at VAOS.

## Hypotheses

We believe that Veterans who are able to choose from the facilities where they currently receive care will be able to complete the facility selection step faster than Veterans who do not.
* We may not be able to test this in this initial round
* Maybe focus on ease over speed

We believe that Veterans who have chosen a facility where they receive care will complete the facilities page more often than those who haven’t.

We believe that Veterans will understand that "save a facility" in VAOS means they will be able to choose that facility more easily the next time they schedule.

## Research questions

| Research question | Interview question(s) |
| ----------------- | --------------------- |
| How do Veterans think about facilities where they currently receive care, compared to those where they are registered? | - Where do you generally receive VA care? <br> - Where are you registered to receive care? <br> - (If they don't know) How would you expect to find out where you're registered? |
| How would it be helpful (if at all) for Veterans find it helpful to know where they are registered? | (Show the registered facilities list) In what situations would you want to know this information, outside of scheduling appointments? |  
| In what ways would it be helpful for a Veteran to manually control which facilities where they currently receive care; or do they expect VA to "just know" this information? | |
| How often do Veterans have multiple VA facilities they go to for the same type of care? Different types of care? | Do you go to the same VA facility for all of your medical appointments? |

## Participants

### Primary criteria
- Must have VA health care

### Secondary criteria
- Ideal to test with Veterans who have visited multiple VA facilities (maybe even in multiple states, and over many years - e.g. had health care through the VA for X+ years? Interestingly if we add a year/timeframe criteria like that we will automatically get an older population)
