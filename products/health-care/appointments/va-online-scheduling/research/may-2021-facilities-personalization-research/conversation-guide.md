## Intro - 5 minutes   

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Peter Russo and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We're looking to understand Veteran's how Veterans choose VA health facilities. Today, I'd like to hear about your experience with getting health care at VA health facilities, and go through a prototype of an online scheduling tool to get your thoughts on it.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [TBD].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **You'll be interacting with a demo tool.** It may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- We like to use recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
    
*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

- First I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you're using to join today?

    - Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.
    
**If phone:**
- OK great. When you are inside the zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?

- First I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the arrow that says "Share content" and hit "share screen". Select that button. You should be prompted with an option to share "Zoom" and then "Screen". Then select "Start Broadcast". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.

- Ok, tap anywhere on the screen to go back to the Zoom application.

- Great, now I can see your phone screen! We are going to use this prototype in our session today. I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments.

**If can't share**
- Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
[Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

- Think about where you receive health care whether VA or not. 

- Do you go to the same place for all of your medical appointments?

- IF ALL VA Do you go outside of VA for healthcare? 
 - IF YES - Where?

- Have you changed where you receive VA health care recently?

- Do you have other options for where to receive care? 
   - YES why do you go to (facility you mentioned)?

-

- Where are you currently registered to receive care?
- (If they don't know) How would you expect to find out where you're registered?
- (If they don't know what registered means [TBD]
