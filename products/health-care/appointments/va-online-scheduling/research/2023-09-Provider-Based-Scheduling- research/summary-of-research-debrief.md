# Research Debrief: Appointment Scheduling Processes at Cerner and VistA Sites

## Purpose
This is a high-level overview of the appointment scheduling processes at Cerner and VistA sites, compiled from our visits two facilities that use VistA and one that uses Cerner. 

While we don't believe two visits were enough to fully understand all the nuances between the two scheduling systems, the takeaways that follow cover some of the key similarities and differences that we heard. We'll be looking in detail at these findings in our full report. 

## Process of Scheduling Appointments
 **VistA:**
     - Veterans can direct schedule online or request an appointment.
     - MSA creates requests and converts them into appointments.
- The MSA selects from a list of clinics to see appointment availability.
- Clinic Selection: The scheduler can search for clinics by name or code. Clinic sometimes corresponds to a physical location at a VA hospital (like a specific room), but can also just be an abstract entity used for internal tracking purposes.
- Selecting a provider is not required to schedule an appointment.
**Cerner:**
     - Veterans must call, email, secure message, or visit in person.
     - MSA creates appointments directly.
- There is not a process in the system for MSAs to create an appointment “request”. When the MSA schedules the appointment, the appointment is immediately confirmed.
- The MSA selects from a list of “resources” to see appointment availability.
- A resource is most often a specific provider, but may be a generic name to indicate multiple providers may service Veteran.
- On the Veteran’s request, MSA can add Veteran to the Standby Request Queue: A list of patients that want to be scheduled sooner than the confirmed appointment date/time.

2. **Aspects Working Well in Each Scheduling Approach**
**In both Cerner and Vista sites:**
   - Efficient, compassionate, and collaborative MSA teams in both systems.
   - VA standard appointments are 30/60 minutes, exceeding the industry standard of 20/40 minutes.
**Cerner:**
- MSAs do not need to cancel appointments when adjusting their times, as they can simply modify the existing "encounter" order.
- MSAs benefit from working with a reduced number of software systems.


3. **Pain Points at Each**
  At both Cerner and Vista sites systems, various pain points were surfaced by MSAs.

**In both Cerner and Vista sites:**

* Overbooking issues (explained in detail below)
* Concerns about PII security (explained in detail below)
* Lack of error prevention mechanisms in scheduling software. (explained in detail below)
* Patient communication and notification issues. (explained in detail below)
* Appointment modifications require canceling and rescheduling.

**VistA:**

* Error prevention:
    * MSAs have notebooks, binders, and sticky notes with helpful, guides, rules, tips and tricks on how to schedule patients instead of being built into the system.
* Using multiple software applications and systems for scheduling is frustrating and time consuming.
* Lack of clear guidance on nationwide VA directives.
* Clinic template build: Clinic profile teams have autonomy in enabling or disabling specific features and settings which can cause inconsistencies in scheduling across clinics.
* While some Clinics that should be allowed to let Veterans schedule using VAOS, do not, others do.
    * For example: One primary care clinic at the Pittsburgh VAMC allows for Veterans to be able to direct schedule, while other clinics with the same business rules, limit the veterans’ ability to manage appointments on VAOS  (do not allow direct schedule, requests, or cancelation.)
* Patients may receive automated voicemails about appointments they don't have, or about an appointment being canceled when it was not, leading to confusion.
* Frustration with PowerBI RTC reports, returning limited records at a time with no specific date ranges.
* PII security concerns:
    * To Verify Patient Information the MSA asks the patient for their last name and the last four digits of their Social Security Number (SSN).
    * AVS papers with DOB, SSN, and full name are left behind by Veterans in public spaces.

**Cerner:**

* Error prevention:
    * Lack of error prevention mechanisms in the scheduling system.
* MSAs' autonomy regardless of their experience can lead to errors requiring higher-level intervention.
* Patients showing up to the same appointment time due to overbooking.
* Missing Contact Information: Some MSAs rely on CPRS for contact information when it is missing in Cerner.
* Displaced Queue:
    * Appointments canceled due to unforeseen circumstances go into the “Displaced Queue”, and patient notifications are not automatic.
    * MSAs maintain a log of contact attempts for rescheduling, which can be time-consuming and difficult to get to leaving patients unaware that their appointment is canceled.
* Appointment Changes (Cerner):
    * When changing an encounter, the appointment is canceled, and a new one is scheduled, with patients not automatically notified.
* PII security concerns: The patient provides their full name, date of birth, and full SSN or DOD number.

## Key Differences Between Cerner and VistA Facilities

### VistA:
- Veterans can directly schedule appointments online or request them.
- MSAs create requests and convert them into appointments.
- MSAs select clinics for appointment availability.
- Selecting a provider is not required to schedule an appointment.

### Cerner:
- Veterans do not have online scheduling; they must call, email, secure message, or visit in person.
- MSAs directly create appointments without a request process.
- MSAs select resources (usually providers) for appointment availability.
- MSAs can add Veterans to the Standby Request Queue on request.
- Providers create "requests" similar to VistA's Return to Clinic orders.



## Next steps
- Contact staff at both sites we visited to get clarification and ask follow up questions. 
- Write a full research report with key findings.
- Create supporting documents to add to the GH research folder and include in the appendix: flow chart for the scheduling process at both, terms and definitions used in both systems, a spreadsheet of contacts to follow up with in the future, collect VistA and Cerner training documents and add them to GH with a link to them in the appendix.
