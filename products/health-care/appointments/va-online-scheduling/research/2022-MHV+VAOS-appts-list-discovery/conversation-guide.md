## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Peter, from the VA Online Scheduling team and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about managing appointments on MyHealtheVet and VA.gov. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **We will ask you to log into MyHealtheVet and VA.gov for this study.** We will not use any of your medical information as a part of this study. And none of the information we do use will be attributed to you directly.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis.   
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.* [TODO - confirm we can record their screen]

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
