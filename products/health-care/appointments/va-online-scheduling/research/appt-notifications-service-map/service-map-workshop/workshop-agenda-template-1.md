## Session Agenda

### [00:00zm] Welcome and introductions

Welcome everyone and go around to introduce yourselves.Â 

### [00:05zm] Introduction to goals of the workshop and blueprinting

The purpose of this blueprinting session is to map the end-to-end and surface-to-core of this particular scenario. We asked all of you here in order to create a true understanding of all aspects of this service experience.

Introduce blueprinting [(slidedeck)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CSpqYSW7gpmzoEWtNXeu2WE3NMYBy_32qnmOutVmk6g/edit#slide=id.g181b679bb4_0_806).

### [00:15zm] Overview of the scenario and steps

To make today go more smoothly, we have already prepared and defined the specific steps of the scenario. That said, if as we go you believe we are missing a step, please speak up. Let's now review the steps in order to make sure we are all on the same page.

### [00:25zm] Review layer definitions

A service blueprint is made of several layers. Now that we understand the top layer---the step definition---let's look at each of the underlying layers. For each step there may be one or more (or none) of each of these layers. [Go through each layer type with examples].

Any questions before we get started?

### [00:30zm] Mapping

Let's map! We're going to go from left to right and dig through each step, using the layers as a checklist.

### [01:25zm] Review map

Now that we can see the full end-to-end and surface-to-core of our map, let's review it one more time to make sure we didn't miss anything, and to think about whether we have and ideas or insights at each step.
