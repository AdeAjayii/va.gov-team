# Appointment notifications service map workshop

## Goals

We've heard in [previous research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/jan-2021-appts-list-test/report-out.md#appointment-reminders-are-inconsistent) that Veterans receive inconsistent updates about their appointments, sometimes too many, sometimes too few. To improve how we communicate important scheduling information to Veterans, we want to better understand how different facilities manage appointment updates across the Veteran's health care journey.

## Methodology

We will run a service mapping workshop with VA facility staff. This will involve three activities, defined below. 

Note that each activity can occur on a different day. Workshop and synthesis should be scheduled for the same week.

All deliverables will be initially captured in the sensitive repo. Once map/report has been scrubbed of identifying information we will post it here.

### 1. Validate user journey (30m)

**Participants**
* Staff scheduling SME at a VA facility.

**Activity**
* Validate the user journey at the top of the service map template.
* Ask them to identify 3-5 staff at the same facility who are directly involved in scheduling and managing Veteran appointments and available to participate in a 2 hour workshop.

**Resources**
* TODO: Add outreach email
* [Service map template](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1628006047131/4a3af5fc0571c2afe52427b9a3b3b6b3b168d96e?sender=ub08ff1d80ee7bd38d6c02354). 

### 2. Service mapping workshop (1h)

**Participants**
* 3-5 staff members + scheduling SME identified in activity #1
* 1 Note taker
 
**Activity**
* Fill out the service map with staff.

**Resources**
* [Service map agenda template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/appt-notifications-service-map/service-map-workshop/workshop-agenda-template.md)

### 3. Synthesis (1h)

**Participants**
* 3-5 staff members + scheduling SME identified in activity #1
* 1 Note taker
 
**Activity**
* Affinity map the critical moments and ideas captured in the Service Map

**Resources**
* Completed service map
* Mural with only critical moments and ideas from previous exercise.

## Participants and recruitment

We will pilot this workshop with 2-5 VA facility staff who are directly involved with the scheduling and managing Veteran appointments at one VA facility. 

This might include: 
* Scheduling veterans for appointments
* Managing schedulers/the scheduling process
* Educating veterans about scheduling

After the pilot we will decide what other types of facilities we want to recruit from. These might include:
* Facilities representative of regional differences (urban v rural)
* Facilities specifically involved in scheduling Community Care appointments.

## When?
* When ready: The pilot is ready.
* Length of sessions: 2.5 hours across 2-3 separate days.

# Team roles

* Moderator: Peter Russo, peter.russo@adhocteam.us
* Research guide writing and task development: Peter Russo, peter.russo@adhocteam.us
* Participant recruiting & screening: We'll work closely with OCTO to identify appropriate facilities/SMEs for outreach.
* Project point of contact: Peter Russo, peter.russo@adhocteam.us
* Participant(s) for pilot test: TBD
