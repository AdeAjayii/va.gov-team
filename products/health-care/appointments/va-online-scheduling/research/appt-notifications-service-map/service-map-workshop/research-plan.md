# Appointment notifications service map workshop

## Goals

We've heard in previou research that Veterans receive inconsistent updates about their appointments, sometimes too many, sometimes too few. To improve how we deliver notifications, We want to better understand how different facilities manage appointment updates across the Veteran's health care journey.

## Methodology

We will run a service mapping workshop with VA facility staff. This will involve three activities, defined below. Note that each activity can occur on a different day. Workshop and synthesis should be scheduled for the same week.

All deliverables will be initially captured in the sensitive repo. Once map/report has been scrubbed of identifying information we will post it here.

### 1. Validate user journey (30m)

Participants
* Staff scheduling SME at a VA facility.

Activity
* Validate the user journey at the top of the service map template.
* Ask them to identify 3-5 staff at the same facility who are directly involved in scheduling and managing Veteran appointments and available to participate in a 2 hour workshop.

Resources
* TODO: Add outreach email
* [Service map template](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1628006047131/4a3af5fc0571c2afe52427b9a3b3b6b3b168d96e?sender=ub08ff1d80ee7bd38d6c02354). 

### 2. Service mapping workshop (1h)

Participants
* 3-5 staff members + scheduling SME identified in activity #1
* 1 Note taker
 
Activity
* Fill out the service map with staff.

### 3. Synthesis (1h)

Participants
* 3-5 staff members + scheduling SME identified in activity #1
* 1 Note taker
 
Activity
* Affinity map the critical moments and ideas captured in the Service Map

Resources
* Completed service map
* Mural with only critical moments and ideas from previous exercise.

## Participants and recruitment

We will run this workshop with VA facility staff who understand the scheduling process at 2-3 facilities. The facilities should be representative of regional differences:
* One urban
* One rural
* TBD: We would like to speak to staff at facilities specifically involved in scheduling Community Care appointments. Refer to previous research.

Each workshop will include a group of 2-5 people actively involved in: 
* Scheduling veterans for appointments
* Managing schedulers/the scheduling process
* Educating veterans about scheduling

## When?
TBD

* When ready: TBD
* Length of sessions: 2.5 hours across 2-3 separate days.
* Pilot: TBD
