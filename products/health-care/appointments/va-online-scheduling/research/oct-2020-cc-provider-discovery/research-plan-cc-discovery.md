# Research Plan for VAOS Community Care Discovery, October 2020

*Problem:* As a veteran, I would like the VAOS app to automatically find community care providers closest to my residential address and auto populate the providers I've selected into the VAOS provider fields so I don't have to manually enter or copy-paste this information.

## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
	This research is for the VA Online Scheduling (VAOS) team.

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

	VAOS allows veterans to schedule health care appointments at VAMCs, or with providers in their community if the veteran meets certain eligibility requirements. Currently veterans communicate their preferred providers by finding them in the Facility Location tool, copying the provider's contact information and pasting it back into the scheduling tool.

	The provider selection prototype is designed to support the following goals:
  	* Help veterans schedule community care appointments by letting them search for providers directly in VAOS.
  	* Help Veterans understand their type of care options, whether a VAMC or Community Care.
  	* Make it clear to Veterans that they can opt out of choosing a provider.
  	* Decrease the amount of time it takes veterans to schedule a community care appointment when selecting a provider.
  	* Help veterans find their requested appointments.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

	* Do veterans understand the difference between community care and VA care
	* Can veterans easily find providers?
  	* Is it easier to find providers on the map or list?
  	* Is it clear what skipping the step of adding a provider means?
  	* Are there other ways veterans expect to be able to find a provider?
  	* Can veterans find their requested pending appointments?
  
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?

  	* Veterans will be able to understand the type of care options presented.
  	* It will be easy for veterans to choose a provider.
  	* Veterans will be able to complete the scheduling process without outside support.
	
## Method	
1. What method of research are you planning? 	

	We're planning on doing a remote, moderated usability study. We'll ask participants to go through a clickable prototype.
  		
2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?

	Having veterans complete tasks in a clickable prototype will help us understand how easily they're able to find the information they're looking for, and gain insight into how they would go about looking for information they can't find. The presence of a moderator will allow us to ask follow-up questions and guide the participant through the tasks.
	
## Participants and Recruitment	
1. Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
	

**Primary criteria / Must have** 

* 8-10 Veteran participants 

**Secondary criteria / Would like to have**

* An even split of men and women
* At least one person in each of the following age brackets: 18-30, 31-50, 50+.
* At least one participant to have a disability rating of 30% or greater.

2. What is your recruitment strategy? 	

TBD from Lauren A and Perigean


## When?
