# Research Plan for VAOS Appointments Usability 


## Background

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

The VAOS team recently released features to help Veterans:
- Navigate between MHV on VA.gov and MHV.
- Navigate to My VA Health (Cerner).
- Navigate between the details pages and their appointment lists.
- Print their appointment lists.

This study will test that those features are meeting Veteran's needs.

Additionally, we want to generate some insights around how Veterans choose facilities or providers. This will help inform our approach to improving these flows in future initiatives.

### OCTO Priorities 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase ðŸ“ˆ

-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an after visit summary, a print functionality on the appointment list page, and ease of navigation with updated breadcrums.

Decrease ðŸ“‰

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it.

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

-   MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

-   MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
-   MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

-   Maintaining my emotional health
-   Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring

-   MTM: Taking care of my health
-   MTM: Managing my declining health

## Research goals

Primary: Verify via UAT that logged in Veterans are able to utilize recently added features and data is populating as expected.

Secondary: Understand Veteran's mental models as they choose a facility or provider when scheduling an appointment. 

### Research questions

1. Are participants able to navigate through the appointments feature?
1. Are the navigation changes displaying correctly?
1. Can participants easily print their appointments lists?

### Outcome

We will use the findings to:

- Validate breadcrumb and URL updates.
- Validate the changes to the navigation descriptive back link.
- To validate the print button design or make iterations based on feedback.
- To understand and validate assumptions around the current facility/clinic selection process for direct scheduling.
- To understand and validate assumptions around the current provider selection for community care appointments. 

### Hypotheses

When logged in Veterans are in the appointments feature on VA.gov:

-   They will be able to navigate their appointments as expected.
-   They will be able to print a list of their (upcoming, pending, past) appointments. 
-   They will be able to find the information they need to attend/join their appointments.

## Method

To meet our primary goal, we'll use a moderated user acceptance test. 

To meet our secondary goal, if time, we'll ask users to complete tasks related to selecting providers and clinics.

### Location

Remote, over Zoom.

### Research materials

For moderated *desktop* usability test 
- [Conversation guide](conversation-guide.md)

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

Perigean will recruit 16 total participants for this study. We will ask Perigean to treat each of three groups as a separate recruitment effort: mobile and desktop.

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria**
