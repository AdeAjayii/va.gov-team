## Research Goals
Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

Starting up

-   MTM: Attending to health needs

Taking care of myself

-   MTM: Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
-   MTM: Managing health issues

Putting down roots

-   Maintaining my emotional health
-   Engaging VA to access benefits and services

Retiring

-   MTM: Taking care of my health
-   MTM: Managing my declining health

This test helped us acheive two goals:

**UAT:** Verify via UAT that logged in Veterans are able to utilize recently added features and data is populating as expected.

**Mental Model Study:** Understand Veteran's mental models as they choose a facility or provider when scheduling an appointment. 


## Research Questions

**UAT:**
1. Are participants able to navigate between to the appointments feature from My VA and MHV on VA.gov?
1. Are participants able to navigate their appointments lists?
1. Can participants easily print their appointments lists?
1. Are users at Cerner facilities able to navigate to My VA Health?

**Mental Model Study**
1. Does the process of selecting a clinic (VistA) or provider (community care) meet participant expectations?
1. What other information would be helpful when scheduling with a provider or clinic?

## Methodology 

We ran a virtual moderated test in two parts: an evaluative UAT study and a generative mental model study.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypotheses or tasks for this research along with the conclusions you found If you conducted a usability test, list the success or task completion rate._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)_

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_

1. Participants will be able to easily navigate to the appointments tool from all entry points.

_Definitely False_

We didn't test all entry points with all participants. Results below indicate the number of participants who passed through the point listed:




2. Participants will be able to easily print a list of their appointments.

_Definitely True_

3. Participants at Cerner facilities will be able to easily navigate to My VA Health.

_Not enough information_

Two participants were at Cerner facilities, so we don't have enough information to draw a conclusion.

4. The process of selecting a facility, clinic, or provider during scheduling will meet participant expectations.




## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

5. Finding five

6. Finding six

7. Finding seven

Brief description

> _Supporting data: Quote here_

> _Supporting data: Quote here_


### All participants complained that logging in can be frustrating.

<abbr title="">About half</abbr> of our participants had trouble during the login process, and <abbr title="8 out of 12">most</abbr> reported that they generally find login to be frustrating.


Labels: label 1, label 2 


### <abbr title="8 out of 12">Most</abbr> participants were confused when navigating across multiple portals to find the appointments tool.

We started off by asking participants to go to VA.gov and find their appointments. Later, we asked them to find other health tools, then navigate back to appointments. 

Participants struggled when navigating across portals. 4 were confused as to why information was duplicated across portals.

Some paths to the appointments tool were more challenging than others.

**Cerner**
Our two Cerner participants easily navigated to Cerner using different paths [Which paths?]. Once they were in Cerner, they could not easily navigate back to VA.gov. This is by design, as Cerner opens in a new tab from VA.gov, and has no links back to VA.gov.


**My HealtheVet National Portal**
5 participants complained of information overload on the Manage your VA Appointments page and NP appointments list. Both pages required a lot of scrolling to get to the tool or call to action.

**Static landing page** 
<abbr title="9 out of 12">Most participants</abbr> navigated to the Appointments tool through the static landing page. 5 complained about information overload on this page, or that it was frustrating to land on it after logging in. 4 were frustrated that they had to click the same button twice to access the appointments tool. One said they would have abandoned the process at this page if they had to deal with it outside of the test.

**MHV on VA.gov home page.**
All but one participant were able to navigate to the MHV on VA.gov home page from the Appointments tool:
- 6 used the breadcrumb
- 9 used the My HealtheVet button on the navbar
- 2 used the dropdown in the Profile menu

The one who couldn't find a path to the page was on a mobile device.

2 participants expected to go directly to the appointments tool when they clicked the link to "Schedule and manage appointments" and were confused when they landed back on the static landing page. [Note how many participants took this path.]

**My VA**
We tested this path with 11 participants. 10 were able to navigate easily from My VA to the Appointments tool. 

The one who struggled was a Cerner user who didn't have a direct path to the appointments tool from My VA.

### All participants easily navigated details pages.

All participants quickly understood how to open details pages. 

Two users didn't use the descriptive back link. One was on a mobile device, and favored using the browser back button at the bottom of their screen instead. Another was on desktop and also used the browser back button. Neither showed any sign of being confused about navigating back to the list view.


### [#] participants struggled to understand their pending appointments.

- 2 participants expected that the number next to Pending (0) should refer to their upcoming appointments.
- 1 associated pending appointments with those requested through secure messages.
- 2 had a moment of confusion before selecting the Pending link


### [#] participants easily found their past appointments

Of those that had trouble: 
- 2 left the appointments tool to look for their past appointments in their health history.
- 1 didn't see the navigation links.


### All participants were able to easily find and use the print button.

Navigating multiple portals was a barrier to finding appointment information.

We asked participants to explore My HealtheVet fro the MHV on VA.gov home page. Most went to Secure Messaging, some to medical history. Afterwards, we asked them if they could find a way to schedule an appointment.



## Additional Insights

_Any additional insights that aren't "key findings." These can be powerful comments from users that don’t represent a pattern in this study, but may be part of one outside this study._

## Participants wanted a more personalized experience for selecting facilities.

3 participants reported seeing unfamiliar or unexpected facilities in the list, such as those that were very far away. 3 wanted to see the facility they currently go to listed first. And 2 were confused that their Primary Care facility wasn't the only one listed when they selected Primary Care. 

Another participant said that their provider changes much more often than location, they would prefer to choose from providers based on their availability here. 

And 1 mentioned they'd like to have availability as the first option to choose from.

2 mentioned that it was easy to find the distance to the facility, and 2 others easily found their desired facility.

## Participants were confused about the request calendar.

4 participants thought the request calendar was showing availability, and they would be able to schedule from there. 1 said they didn't trust that scheduling in this way would lead to an actual appointment.

## Participants were confused by the alert that told them Community Care was unavialable for podiatry.

2 participants said that they currently receive community care for podiatry, and were frustrated at this message.
