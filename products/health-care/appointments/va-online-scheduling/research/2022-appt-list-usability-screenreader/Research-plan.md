Research plan for VAOS appointments list screenreader usabilty test
=============

Background
----------

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans who are logged into VA.gov to schedule and manage their appointments.

The VA Online Scheduling and MyHealtheVet teams worked together to identify gaps between scheduling features in the two products. They completed an analysis [to identify gaps](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/HealthApartment/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B24A0A2A8-279E-42D1-B0E4-3C1C8EF5D5F5%7D&file=MHV%2BVAOS%20Gap%20analysis%20recommendations.docx&wdOrigin=OFFICECOM-WEB.MAIN.SEARCH&ct=1656340079030&action=default&mobileredirect=true) between the two products. Then, the VAOS team [tested a design concept](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/2022-MHV%2BVAOS-appts-list-discovery/report-MHV%2BVAOS-appts-list-discovery.md) that would meet the needs identified in the gap analysis.

The VAOS team also wants to evaluate potential changes to the appointment details page content and navigation.

Building on those activities, this research will evaluate:

-   The screenreader usability of the redesigned appointment list

Also see [Product's initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/initiatives/appointment-list/product-outline-appointment-list-2022.md).

### OCTO Objectives

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Increase ðŸ“ˆ

-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov: by providing an appointments list that meets Veteran expectations and needs.

Decrease ðŸ“‰

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution: by providing the right information about appointments when Veterans need it

### Veteran journey

Veterans may interact with VAOS at different stages across the [veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
