## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Peter and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about scheduling health care appointments. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **During this session we would like to see information about your appointments** This will mean logging into VA.gov and running through the scheduling process with your account. Anything we do in your account will not affect your VA health benefits. This information will not be used or shared outside of this research. Are you comfortable with sharing your health information with us today?
- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
