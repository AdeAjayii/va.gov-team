VAOS Requests Discovery - Research Plan [WIP]
=============================================

Background
----------

VA Online Scheduling allows Veterans to request and schedule health care appointments if they are logged into VA.gov. It is one [channel](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/design/scheduling-channels-touchpoints.md) Veterans can use to schedule appointments.

### Problem

Veterans are generally confused by requests:

[2019 Research](<https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/july-2020-user-research/2020-july-VAOSR-EC-research-report.md#findings>)

[2021 appts list usability](<https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/jan-2021-appts-list-test/report-out.md#appointment-requests-continue-to-create-confusion>)

We believe that:

-   It isn't clear to a Veteran when an appointment becomes a request (vs. direct scheduling).
-   It isn't clear to a Veteran what an appointment request is.
-   Veterans don't know where to find information about their existing appointment requests.

### OCTO-DE Objectives

[OCTO-DE objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) this research supports.

-   Increase: Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov
-   Decrease: 
-   Call center volume, wait time, time to resolution
-   Time to successfully complete and submit online transactions (?)

### Veteran Journey

[TODO] Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter?

Research Goals
--------------

1.  Learn how appointment requests are confusing to Veterans
2.  Validate concepts for reducing that confusion.

### Outcome

We'll use these findings to make appointment requests easier to understand so Veterans can make better choices when they can't direct-schedule an appointment.

### Research questions

-   How are requests confusing Veterans during the scheduling process?
-   How are requests confusing Veterans when viewing their appointments on the VAOS home page? 
-   What value do appointment requests provide Veterans?

### Hypotheses

We believe that requests are confusing to Veterans because there is no indication at the point when an appointment becomes a request during the scheduling process. If we clearly show when this transition happens, Veterans will be able to make better choices about whether to continue with requesting the appointment, or choose another scheduling option outside of VAOS.

We believe that, once an appointment is requested, Veterans expect to see them listed with their existing appointments. If we surface the number of outstanding requests on the VAOS home page, Veterans will be able to more easily understand what requests are, and how to find details about them.

Method
------

To get a better understanding of why Veterans are confused by the current state of requests, we'll run UAT with participants, focusing on:
-   Requesting an appointment, then canceling that request.
-   Finding their appointment requests.

Then, we'll run usability tests with a prototype of new features to help guide the eventual solution:

### Location

Remote, via Zoom.

Recruitment
-----------

### Recruitment approach

We will use Perigean to recruit Veterans for this research.

### Recruitment criteria

10-12 Veterans with VA health care established at facilities.

**Primary criteria**

- Has an active ID.me, MHV, or DS Logon account
- Is able to log-in to VA.gov
- Has established health care at a VA facility
- Are you willing to log into your VA.gov account and show information about your health care appointments to our research team?
- Which account do you use to log in to VA.gov - ID.me, MHV, or DS Logon?

Timeline
--------

### Prepare

Test materials will be finalised by TBD

Pilot Date/time is TBD

### Research sessions

Date/time is TBD

### Length of sessions

Sessions will be scheduled for 1 hour to account for difficulties logging in.

### Availability

TBD
