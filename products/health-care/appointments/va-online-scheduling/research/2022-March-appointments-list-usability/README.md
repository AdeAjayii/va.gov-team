## Appointments list usability

This study will evaluate our designs for an improved desktop and print view. This work started with a [gap analysis](https://dvagov.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/HealthApartment/Shared%20Documents/Appointments%20Analysis?csf=1&web=1&e=16txU2) between the MHV and VAOS appointment lists. See also the [appointments list concept test](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/research/2022-MHV%2BVAOS-appts-list-discovery).
