# VA Online Scheduling: VAOSR and "Express Care" Research Report

## Research Process

### Research focus

This user research and usability test focused on two products under the health care and scheduling umbrella, under development by the Digital Experience and Product Office (DEPO) at VA: VA Online Scheduling Request (VAOSR) and Express Care.

#### VAOSR

The VAOSR MVP has been in production and live on [VA.gov](VA.gov) since March 2020. Since it's launch, the tool has provided users the ability to submit feedback as well as captured data through Google Analytics. From these data sources and based on the timing of the tool being accessible to users, DEPO's team determined another round of user research and usability testing with Veterans was necessary. 

This research, in July 2020, focused on areas in the experience that we determined (through the aforementioned analytics and user feedback) are confusing or need iteration. Additionally, we wanted to collect general feedback and requests from Veterans for additional feature considerations for VAOSR, to be implemented in the future. This feedback from Veterans about feature requests is also helpful to validate current assumptions about DEPO's VAOSR product development backlog, to ensure the product is being designed with users, not for them. 

#### Express Care

VA developed Express Care to enable virtual access between Veteran patients and their medical providers ("PACTs"). However, Express Care as a service is not utilized by providers or patients, respectively. 

In [May 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/express-care-research/2020-may-research/express-care-research-report.md), DEPO conducted user research and usability testing focusing on understanding when, why, and how a Veteran seeks care that they deem "urgent", "immediate", and "now" through VA digital channels. This previous research also allowed us to learn from Veterans if they were aware of and would seek urgent, same-day, Telehealth care from VA for a COVID-19 screening, if they were experiencing symptoms.

The research conducted in July 2020 aimed to iterate on what we learned in the previous research study, in order to build and launch a product, immediately, on [VA.gov](VA.gov), incorporating feedback provided by users in the initial round of research, as well as new features and considerations from stakeholders. 

### Research methodology

For this study, we conducted remote moderated usability research and usability testing. Veterans were asked questions related to their current habits around scheduling medical appointments with VA providers. Next, Veterans were directed to a specific page on [VA.gov](VA.gov) with content about scheduling appointments online. From here, Veterans were asked to interact with VAOSR by logging into their accounts on [VA.gov](VA.gov), granting them access to the tool. Veterans were asked their opinion about their account and the information presented upon logging in and accessing their appointments page and navigating through the information. Finally, Veterans were asked to schedule and cancel an appointment using the tool, if possible and as necessary. 

After familiarizing with VAOSR, Veterans were asked general questions about Express Care, which were the same as the previous round of research ([May 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/express-care-research/2020-may-research/express-care-research-report.md)). Veterans were shown and asked to interact with a mid-fidelity, clickable prototype of the Express Care concept for [VA.gov](VA.gov). This research primarily focused on feedback around changes made to process of making an Express Care request and the content presented when doing so. 

### Who we talked to

DEPO conducted 15 60-minute remote research sessions over nine days. Not all users were able to conduct all portions of the proposed research. The majority of Veterans were able to complete the research in full (9; 60%). However, some Veterans were unable to log into their account on [VA.gov](VA.gov) to access VAOSR, either due to system outages or personal account access issues. 

Towards the end of the research effort, an update was made to the Express Care prototype. As a result, one (7%) Veteran tested a revised prototype for Express Care. Additionally, questions were also added to "Section 0: Warm-up questions", in order to learn more about Veterans' mental model to apply to the appointment scheduling/request flow. Two Veterans (13%) were asked these questions and were not shown the Express Care prototype.

A full breakdown of participant session coverage and their demographics are below:

* 9 (60%): Full research (VAOSR and Express Care v1)
* 1 (7%): VAOSR only
* 2 (13%): Express Care v1 only
* 1 (7%): Express Care v2 only
* 2 (13%): VAOSR only and additional scheduling questions

## Research Findings & Recommendations

### 1. Simplify, streamline, and make content consistent from one part of scheduling flow to another.

> 

Content presented the biggest burden to all users. Veterans indicated excessive trouble understanding, parsing through, and comprehending the information presented to them. For both experiences (VAOSR and Express Care), Veterans indicated not only was the amount of content a burden, but the variation throughout the content used to describe the same information difficult for them to manage. 

#### VAOSR Examples

- [VA.gov - Schedule and View VA appointment](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/) page
  - `"How do I know if my VA health facility uses online scheduling?"` section: Several veterans confused the bulleted list of locations *exempt* from online scheduling as the only locations that permit online scheduling
- Location selection * 
  - Veterans did not know which location to select from the list because there was no affiliated City, State with the affiliated VAMC
  - See more in *[#4: Location selection](#4-redesign-the-location-selection-process-in-vaosr)*
- Appointment request review screen * 
  - Time of appointment was confused with time requested for scheduler to call the Veteran to confirm/schedule the appointment

#### Express Care (version 1) examples

- Emergency content made several users think Express Care is intended for emergency care, despite reading a description of Express Care on the previous screen and identifying it as not for emergencies. 
- 

Most participants recognized a discrepancy in the terminology used for the tool they interacted with to "Schedule an Appointment" on [VA.gov](VA.gov). Throughout the process, as the users interacted with the tool and periodically read through the content, they began to recognize that they outcome would not be a scheduled appointment, but an appointment request. 

Taking this into account, content still presents a large burden to users throughout the process, beginning with the terminology used to describe VAOSR, as this does not *actually* an appointment for the user, as nearly every participant pointed out. The terminology used to describe the tool was misleading to users, misleading them from the start. This issue ties into recommendation *[#2: Clarify the purpose of using VAOSR](#2-clarify-the-purpose-of-using-vaosr-it-is-a-scheduling-request-tool-not-an-appointment-booking-tool)*. 

*** *Note:*** all Veterans during these research sessions said that it was unusual for them to spend as much time as they were reading content. Some also acknowledged they would likely give up or not get as far along in the process as they did had they not been in the research session. If this were the case, they said they would give up and call their provider's office or the scheduling line to complete their request. 



### 2. Clarify the purpose of using VAOSR: it is a scheduling request tool, not an appointment booking tool. 

> 

Veterans did not see a significant value in using VAOSR over their current method for scheduling an appointment (i.e. - calling the scheduling line or their provider's office directly, contacting their provider using Secure Messaging, or using MyHealth*e*Vet), due to VAOSR being a *request* system, not an actual appointment scheduling tool.


### 3. Incorporate more details about who, why, and when an appointment was cancelled. 

> 

All participants who were asked about appointment cancellations (60% total participants) said cancellations functioned as anticipated, were able to find this option, and were able cancel their appointment (if they chose to do so) with ease. However, there was significant concern expressed about *who* and *why* their appointments were cancelled.  

### 4. Redesign the location selection process in VAOSR. 

> 

Every Veteran participant that interacted with VAOSR (12; 80%) had more than one VAMC affiliated with their account and 100% of these Veterans struggled to find the location where they wanted to schedule an appointment.

### 5. Give Veterans sort and filter options when viewing their appointment lists.

>

Nearly every participant overlooked the color-coding appointment cards, until after going through the scheduling process (for both/either VAOSR and/or Express Care). Upon noticing status indicators (color coding, icons, terminology), Veterans showed a strong preference for these categorizations. 

### 6. Provide specific information about an appointment so that Veterans know who they saw, the type of care, the type of visit, and additional relevant information about their appointment. 

> 

Veterans indicated dissatisfaction with the information presented on appointment cards when viewing upcoming and past appointments. Participants said, much like the scheduling process, confusion when viewing a number of appointments in their account and attempting to discern which appointment was which. 

### 7. Reevaluate process for requesting an appointment flow to align with a user's mental model. This may require conducting additional user research.

> 



### 8. Create the ability to reschedule or request another appointment, based on an appointment the Veteran already has scheduled in their account.

>
