# VA Online Scheduling: VAOSR and "Express Care" Research Report

## Research Process

### Research focus

This user research and usability test focused on two products under the health care and scheduling umbrella, under development by the Digital Experience and Product Office (DEPO) at VA: VA Online Scheduling Request (VAOSR) and Express Care.

#### VAOSR

The VAOSR MVP has been in production and live on [VA.gov](VA.gov) since March 2020. Since it's launch, the tool has provided users the ability to submit feedback as well as captured data through Google Analytics. From these data sources and based on the timing of the tool being accessible to users, DEPO's team determined another round of user research and usability testing with Veterans was necessary. 

This research, in July 2020, focused on areas in the experience that we determined (through the aforementioned analytics and user feedback) are confusing or need iteration. Additionally, we wanted to collect general feedback and requests from Veterans for additional feature considerations for VAOSR, to be implemented in the future. This feedback from Veterans about feature requests is also helpful to validate current assumptions about DEPO's VAOSR product development backlog, to ensure the product is being designed with users, not for them. 

#### Express Care

VA developed Express Care to enable virtual access between Veteran patients and their medical providers ("PACTs"). However, Express Care as a service is not utilized by providers or patients, respectively. 

In [May 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/express-care-research/2020-may-research/express-care-research-report.md), DEPO conducted user research and usability testing focusing on understanding when, why, and how a Veteran seeks care that they deem "urgent", "immediate", and "now" through VA digital channels. This previous research also allowed us to learn from Veterans if they were aware of and would seek urgent, same-day, Telehealth care from VA for a COVID-19 screening, if they were experiencing symptoms.

The research conducted in July 2020 aimed to iterate on what we learned in the previous research study, in order to build and launch a product, immediately, on [VA.gov](VA.gov), incorporating feedback provided by users in the initial round of research, as well as new features and considerations from stakeholders. 

### Research methodology

For this study, we conducted remote moderated usability research and usability testing. Veterans were asked questions related to their current habits around scheduling medical appointments with VA providers. Next, Veterans were directed to a specific page on [VA.gov](VA.gov) with content about scheduling appointments online. From here, Veterans were asked to interact with VAOSR by logging into their accounts on [VA.gov](VA.gov), granting them access to the tool. Veterans were asked their opinion about their account and the information presented upon logging in and accessing their appointments page and navigating through the information. Finally, Veterans were asked to schedule and cancel an appointment using the tool, if possible and as necessary. 

After familiarizing with VAOSR, Veterans were asked general questions about Express Care, which were the same as the previous round of research ([May 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/express-care-research/2020-may-research/express-care-research-report.md)). Veterans were shown and asked to interact with a mid-fidelity, clickable prototype of the Express Care concept for [VA.gov](VA.gov). This research primarily focused on feedback around changes made to process of making an Express Care request and the content presented when doing so. 

### Who we talked to

DEPO conducted 15 60-minute remote research sessions over nine days. Not all users were able to conduct all portions of the proposed research. The majority of Veterans were able to complete the research in full (9; 60%). However, some Veterans were unable to log into their account on [VA.gov](VA.gov) to access VAOSR, either due to system outages or personal account access issues. 

Towards the end of the research effort, an update was made to the Express Care prototype. As a result, one (7%) Veteran tested a revised prototype for Express Care. Additionally, questions were also added to "Section 0: Warm-up questions", in order to learn more about Veterans' mental model to apply to the appointment scheduling/request flow. Two Veterans (13%) were asked these questions and were not shown the Express Care prototype.

A full breakdown of participant session coverage and their demographics are below:

* 9 (60%): Full research (VAOSR and Express Care v1)
* 1 (7%): VAOSR only
* 2 (13%): Express Care v1 only
* 1 (7%): Express Care v2 only
* 2 (13%): VAOSR only and additional scheduling questions

## Research Findings & Recommendations

In the section below, findings and recommendations are explored in greater depth, citing specific improvements, broadly as well as specific recommendations for the respective products, VAOSR and Express Care. 

#### Content

Content presented the biggest burden to all users. Veterans indicated excessive trouble understanding, parsing through, and comprehending the information presented to them. For both experiences (VAOSR and Express Care), Veterans indicated not only was the amount of content a burden, but the variation throughout the content used to describe the same information difficult for them to manage. 

Content about scheduling on [VA.gov](VA.gov) and throughout the tools and services on the platform are designed with Veterans. However, Veterans repeatedly expressed concerns in these research sessions about their constraints when interacting with the information online, due to a variety of factors, often including (but not limited to): PTSD, effects of combat-related injuries or conditions, technical ability, and/or age. Additionally, Veterans said that there is too much, albeit helpful, content, which contributes to and creates a sense of overload when they were interacting with both VAOSR and Express Care. For example, Veterans said the content on the subway map page for Express Care was important, made sense, and they understood that for emergency situations, they should proceed. This emergency content made several users think Express Care is intended for emergency care, despite reading a description of Express Care on the previous screen and identifying it as not for emergencies.  

Further confusion and frustration was created by content for Veterans when interacting with VAOSR, in particular. The content advertises the tool as an online scheduler, however the outcome of use is an appointment request. Veterans did not see a significant value in using VAOSR over their current method for scheduling an appointment (i.e. - calling the scheduling line or their provider's office directly, contacting their provider using Secure Messaging, or using MyHealth*e*Vet), due to VAOSR being a *request* system, not an actual appointment scheduling tool. Most participants recognized a discrepancy in the terminology used for the tool they interacted with to "Schedule an Appointment" on [VA.gov](VA.gov). Throughout the process, as the users interacted with the tool and periodically read through the content, they began to recognize that they outcome would not be a scheduled appointment, but an appointment request. 

***Recommendations:*** 

- VAOSR and Express Care content must be audited and tested with Veterans for consistency of voice, tone, and vocabulary throughout the products.
- VAOSR and Express Care content must be audited and tested with Veterans for readability and comprehension.
- VAOSR and Express Care content must be audited and tested with Veterans for understanding, accuracy, and consistency of information throughout their experience.
- VAOSR and Express Care content must be updated to include critical information to allow Veterans the information they need to make informed decisions.  
- VAOSR content must be changed to accurately describe VAOSR and the actions the tool allows the Veteran to accomplish.
- Express Care content must be both reduced for readability and ease of comprehension as well as audited for consistency. 
- Express Care content must be updated to reflect process for requesting this appointment type.

#### Context

Similar to content, providing context shapes a Veteran's understanding of the product or service they are interacting with and that experience determines their desire to use it in the future. Context comes through in the form of wayfinding, information, repeated and recognized patterns, and features that are developed closely alongside of the user. In this study, Veterans were asked to provide their opinions and feedback about the information provided on appointment cards about upcoming and previous appointments, how their appointments were displayed in their appointments list, the statuses of these appointments, and other indicators they may or may not have noticed or identified. Additionally, Veterans were asked to provide feedback about categorization and filtering of information on their appointments within their account, how the current format served them, and how it may work better. 

All participants who were asked about appointment cancellations (60% total participants) said cancellations functioned as anticipated, were able to find this option, and were able cancel their appointment (if they chose to do so) with ease. However, there was significant concern expressed about *who* and *why* their appointments were cancelled.  

***Recommendations:***

- Redesign appointment cards to include additional details about each appointment, to include: date, provider, location, type of care, status, type of appointment. 
- Consider reducing the size of each appointment cards, displaying imperative information in list view, with more details displayed upon expansion.
- Make indicators, such as color and icons more prominent and recognizable throughout the system.
- Redesign appointment page to include sorting and filtering options when viewing appointment lists, based on additional details incorporated into appointment cards (date, provider, location, type of care, status, type of appointment).
- Add additional details to appointment cards for cancelled appointments, to include: who cancelled the appointment, the reason for cancellation, and when the appointment was cancelled.
- Incorporate vaccinations, preventative treatments, and other appointments and treatments covered by the VA (non-VA medical providers), into appointment lists.
