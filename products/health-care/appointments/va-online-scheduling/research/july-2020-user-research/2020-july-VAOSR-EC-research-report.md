# VA Online Scheduling: VAOSR and "Express Care" Research Report

## Research Process

### Research focus

This user research and usability test focused on two products under the health care and scheduling umbrella, under development by the Digital Experience and Product Office (DEPO) at VA: VA Online Scheduling Request (VAOSR) and Express Care.

#### VAOSR

The VAOSR MVP has been in production and live on [VA.gov](VA.gov) since March 2020. Since it's launch, the tool has provided users the ability to submit feedback as well as captured data through Google Analytics. From these data sources and based on the timing of the tool being accessible to users, DEPO's team determined another round of user research and usability testing with Veterans was necessary. 

This research, in July 2020, focused on areas in the experience that we determined (through the aforementioned analytics and user feedback) are confusing or need iteration. Additionally, we wanted to collect general feedback and requests from Veterans for additional feature considerations for VAOSR, to be implemented in the future. This feedback from Veterans about feature requests is also helpful to validate current assumptions about DEPO's VAOSR product development backlog, to ensure the product is being designed with users, not for them. 

#### Express Care

VA developed Express Care to enable virtual access between Veteran patients and their medical providers ("PACTs"). However, Express Care as a service is not utilized by providers or patients, respectively. 

In [May 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/express-care-research/2020-may-research/express-care-research-report.md), DEPO conducted user research and usability testing focusing on understanding when, why, and how a Veteran seeks care that they deem "urgent", "immediate", and "now" through VA digital channels. This previous research also allowed us to learn from Veterans if they were aware of and would seek urgent, same-day, Telehealth care from VA for a COVID-19 screening, if they were experiencing symptoms.

The research conducted in July 2020 aimed to iterate on what we learned in the previous research study, in order to build and launch a product, immediately, on [VA.gov](VA.gov), incorporating feedback provided by users in the initial round of research, as well as new features and considerations from stakeholders. 

### Research methodology

For this study, we conducted remote moderated usability research and usability testing. Veterans were asked questions related to their current habits around scheduling medical appointments with VA providers. Next, Veterans were directed to a specific page on [VA.gov](VA.gov) with content about scheduling appointments online. From here, Veterans were asked to interact with VAOSR by logging into their accounts on [VA.gov](VA.gov), granting them access to the tool. Veterans were asked their opinion about their account and the information presented upon logging in and accessing their appointments page and navigating through the information. Finally, Veterans were asked to schedule and cancel an appointment using the tool, if possible and as necessary. 

After familiarizing with VAOSR, Veterans were asked general questions about Express Care, which were the same as the previous round of research ([May 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/express-care-research/2020-may-research/express-care-research-report.md)). Veterans were shown and asked to interact with a mid-fidelity, clickable prototype of the Express Care concept for [VA.gov](VA.gov). This research primarily focused on feedback around changes made to process of making an Express Care request and the content presented when doing so. 

### Who we talked to

DEPO conducted 15 60-minute remote research sessions over nine days. Not all users were able to conduct all portions of the proposed research. The majority of Veterans were able to complete the research in full (9; 60%). However, some Veterans were unable to log into their account on [VA.gov](VA.gov) to access VAOSR, either due to system outages or personal account access issues. 

Towards the end of the research effort, an update was made to the Express Care prototype. As a result, one (7%) Veteran tested a revised prototype for Express Care. Additionally, questions were also added to "Section 0: Warm-up questions", in order to learn more about Veterans' mental model to apply to the appointment scheduling/request flow. Two Veterans (13%) were asked these questions and were not shown the Express Care prototype.

A full breakdown of participant session coverage and their demographics are below:

* 9 (60%): Full research (VAOSR and Express Care v1)
* 1 (7%): VAOSR only
* 2 (13%): Express Care v1 only
* 1 (7%): Express Care v2 only
* 2 (13%): VAOSR only and additional scheduling questions

## Findings & Recommendations Overview

### Findings 

Overall, both VAOSR and Express Care were well received by most of the Veterans who interacted with each product, respectively. Taking into account the fact that there were several Veterans that only interacted with one or the other and/or different iterations of the Express Care prototype, both products were generally usable and made sense to Veterans. Only one Veteran who interacted with the Express Care prototype did not understand the concept. 

However, there were a number of significant challenges presented in both experiences. Veterans expressly stated that had they not been participating in a research session, able to ask questions, and had someone to provide assistance and guidance through either a hypothetical task or a task they were interested in completing, that they would have given up attempting to use the respective tool, opting to call their provider to complete the task, or more realistically, given up entirely. 

In addition to, and likely contributing to their difficulty in completing their tasks, Veterans struggled significantly with understanding both VAOSR and Express Care, conceptually. Most notably, Veterans stated a significant frustration upon initiating scheduling a request in VAOSR, only to learn and/or realize after interacting with VAOSR that the tool does not *actually* complete the scheduling request. Veterans indicated this to be especially frustrating since content throughout VAOSR and on VA.gov referred to the tool consistently as a self-scheduling option. Likewise, when interacting with the first version of the Express Care prototype, Veterans read the service warning and consent information as what Express Care *could*  provide, rather than the alternative. 

Despite this frustration, 10 of the thirteen (3 participants did not interact with VAOSR) participants stated they would utilize VAOSR in the future to attempt to request/schedule an appointment with their VA medical provider in the future, now that they are aware of the option (none of the participants who participated in this research previously used VAOSR or were aware of this tool on VA.gov).

To summarize, Veterans were content overall with the product improvements, indicating that a self-service option was by-in-large preferable to their current method for scheduling an appointment, even though VAOSR did not result in a scheduled appointment, today. Additionally, of those participants who interacted with Express Care, most were extremely interested in utilizing this service, not only during the current pandemic, but under ordinary circumstance when in need of treatment, rather than seeking an appointment from a VA medical provider, or going through private insurance, as VA often takes too long and isn't timely enough for treatment of a common cold, for example. 

### Recommendations overview

There are some recommendations that are applicable to one or both products. In the section below, findings and recommendations are explored in greater depth, citing specific improvements, broadly and for the respective product. The following are areas that are addressed in the next section:

- Content (instructions, static content, and voice/tone/vocabulary for product) 
- Context on user's appointment view (appointment lists, cards, appointment list, filtering, and categorization)
- VAOSR "request an appointment flow" (selecting: type of care, location/choosing a facility, type of visit, providing details)
- Rescheduling (and scheduling) options
