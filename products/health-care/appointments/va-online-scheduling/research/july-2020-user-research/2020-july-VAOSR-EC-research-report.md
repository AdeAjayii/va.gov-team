# VA Online Scheduling: VAOSR and "Express Care" Research Report

## Research Process

### Research focus

This user research and usability test focused on two products under the health care and scheduling umbrella, under development by the Digital Experience and Product Office (DEPO) at VA: VA Online Scheduling Request (VAOSR) and Express Care.

#### VAOSR

The VAOSR MVP has been in production and live on [VA.gov](VA.gov) since March 2020. Since it's launch, the tool has provided users the ability to submit feedback as well as captured data through Google Analytics. From these data sources and based on the timing of the tool being accessible to users, DEPO's team determined another round of user research and usability testing with Veterans was necessary. 

This research, in July 2020, focused on areas in the experience that we determined (through the aforementioned analytics and user feedback) are confusing or need iteration. Additionally, we wanted to collect general feedback and requests from Veterans for additional feature considerations for VAOSR, to be implemented in the future. This feedback from Veterans about feature requests is also helpful to validate current assumptions about DEPO's VAOSR product development backlog, to ensure the product is being designed with users, not for them. 

#### Express Care

VA developed Express Care to enable virtual access between Veteran patients and their medical providers ("PACTs"). However, Express Care as a service is not utilized by providers or patients, respectively. 

In [May 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/express-care-research/2020-may-research/express-care-research-report.md), DEPO conducted user research and usability testing focusing on understanding when, why, and how a Veteran seeks care that they deem "urgent", "immediate", and "now" through VA digital channels. This previous research also allowed us to learn from Veterans if they were aware of and would seek urgent, same-day, Telehealth care from VA for a COVID-19 screening, if they were experiencing symptoms.

The research conducted in July 2020 aimed to iterate on what we learned in the previous research study, in order to build and launch a product, immediately, on [VA.gov](VA.gov), incorporating feedback provided by users in the initial round of research, as well as new features and considerations from stakeholders. 

### Research methodology

For this study, we conducted remote moderated usability research and usability testing. Veterans were asked questions related to their current habits around scheduling medical appointments with VA providers. Next, Veterans were directed to a specific page on [VA.gov](VA.gov) with content about scheduling appointments online. From here, Veterans were asked to interact with VAOSR by logging into their accounts on [VA.gov](VA.gov), granting them access to the tool. Veterans were asked their opinion about their account and the information presented upon logging in and accessing their appointments page and navigating through the information. Finally, Veterans were asked to schedule and cancel an appointment using the tool, if possible and as necessary. 

After familiarizing with VAOSR, Veterans were asked general questions about Express Care, which were the same as the previous round of research ([May 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/appointments/va-online-scheduling/express-care-research/2020-may-research/express-care-research-report.md)). Veterans were shown and asked to interact with a mid-fidelity, clickable prototype of the Express Care concept for [VA.gov](VA.gov). This research primarily focused on feedback around changes made to process of making an Express Care request and the content presented when doing so. 

### Who we talked to

DEPO conducted 15 60-minute remote research sessions over nine days. Not all users were able to conduct all portions of the proposed research. The majority of Veterans were able to complete the research in full (9; 60%). However, some Veterans were unable to log into their account on [VA.gov](VA.gov) to access VAOSR, either due to system outages or personal account access issues. 

Towards the end of the research effort, an update was made to the Express Care prototype. As a result, one (7%) Veteran tested a revised prototype for Express Care. Additionally, questions were also added to "Section 0: Warm-up questions", in order to learn more about Veterans' mental model to apply to the appointment scheduling/request flow. Two Veterans (13%) were asked these questions and were not shown the Express Care prototype.

A full breakdown of participant session coverage and their demographics are below:

* 9 (60%): Full research (VAOSR and Express Care v1)
* 1 (7%): VAOSR only
* 2 (13%): Express Care v1 only
* 1 (7%): Express Care v2 only
* 2 (13%): VAOSR only and additional scheduling questions
