# Themes [DRAFT]

A meta-analysis of past research to identify recurring themes. Improvements in these areas would likely have greater impact than others.

## Data needs

*Veterans need to understand what an appointment is for, who it's with, and where it is. Often this information is missing from the appointment.*

---

Missing, confusing appointment information makes the lists difficult to use.

[Appointment List Screenreader Usability Study](./2023-02-appt-list-usability-screenreader/research-findings.md#missing-confusing-appointment-information-makes-the-lists-difficult-to-use), 2023-02

Participants wanted to be able to easily differentiate between appointments. The most helpful data for this:  
* 7/9 Type of care
* 4/9 Clinic name - as it is called at the VA facility.
* 2/9 Whether the appointment was for, or connected to, labs.

[Appointment List Usability Test](./2022-09-appts-list-usability/research-findings.md#3-access-to-secure-messaging), 2022-09

Small text is a challenge.

[Appointment List Usability Test](./2022-09-appts-list-usability/research-findings.md#4-small-text), 2022-09

Participants were most confused that two different sites list their appointments.

[MHV and VAOS Appointments List Discovery](./2022-01-mhv-and-vaos-appts-list-discovery/research-findings.md#participants-were-most-confused-that-two-different-sites-list-their-appointments), 2022-01

Some participants were confused to see unfamiliar facilities when navigating from MHV to VAOS

[MHV and VAOS Appointments List Discovery](./2022-01-mhv-and-vaos-appts-list-discovery/research-findings.md#some-participants-were-confused-to-see-unfamiliar-facilities-when-navigating-from-mhv-to-vaos), 2022-01

Participants wanted to easily understand how and where they would attend their appointments.

We saw similar findings in these studies:
* [2021 requests discovery](../2021-11-request-clarification-research/research-findings.md#appointment-list-and-details-pages-data)
* The Check-in Experience team's [October 2021 Usability Study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/phase2-usability/research-findings.md#seeing-a-list-of-all-the-days-appointments-is-valuable-to-veterans)


Participants wanted tools to help them contact their provider

5/9 participants said they don't use the appointment list in MHV often - talks about how they use the appointment list:
* 5/9: Verify that their upcoming appointments are properly scheduled by VA
* 3/9: Check if they have upcoming appointments
* 2/9: Check against their personal calendar to make sure they're not double-booked
* 2/9: Use past appointments information to plan for annual appointments

(Next - request clarification research)

During the prototype test, 7/8 participants understood that they were requesting an appointment. 4/8 participants indicated frustration when they saw that the facility "doesn't allow self-scheduling online."

[Request Clarification Study](./2021-11-request-clarification-research/research-findings.md#78-participants-understood-that-they-were-requesting-an-appointment), 2021-11

4/8 participants indicated frustration when they saw that the facility "doesn't allow self-scheduling online." After reading further, all realized they could still complete the process online. This reduced frustration for 3 of them - the other participant (P2) previously had a bad experience requesting appointments through VAOS and hadn't used the tool since then.

[Request Clarification Study](./2021-11-request-clarification-research/research-findings.md#78-participants-understood-that-they-were-requesting-an-appointment), 2021-11

During the prototype test, Most participants chose "have the facility call me back" as their preferred option.

[Request Clarification Study](./2021-11-request-clarification-research/research-findings.md#most-participants-chose-have-the-facility-call-me-back-as-their-preferred-option), 2021-11

During the prototype test, no other participant indicated a preference for calling the facility to schedule. Participants reported the same pain points around wait times and navigating the phone tree that we've heard in other studies.

[Request Clarification Study](./2021-11-request-clarification-research/research-findings.md#most-participants-chose-have-the-facility-call-me-back-as-their-preferred-option), 2021-11

When we presented an option to send a secure message instead of a request, 3/8 said they had used secure messaging before but had to send multiple messages before they received a response, if they received one at all. None of these chose secure message as their preference.

3/8 expected to be able to send a message directly after selecting the option.

[Request Clarification Study](./2021-11-request-clarification-research/research-findings.md#most-participants-chose-have-the-facility-call-me-back-as-their-preferred-option), 2021-11

3/8 participants indicated they would have preferred the option to self-schedule over all of the other options presented.

[Request Clarification Study](./2021-11-request-clarification-research/research-findings.md#most-participants-chose-have-the-facility-call-me-back-as-their-preferred-option), 2021-11

In the prototype, most participants found their requested appointments in the status dropdown

[Request Clarification Study](./2021-11-request-clarification-research/research-findings.md#most-participants-found-their-requested-appointments-in-the-status-dropdown), 2021-11

Appointment list and details pages navigation.

Requested appointment detail page:

* 6/8 clicked the "back" link  
* 2/8 used the back button on their browser 

Upcoming appointment detail page:

* 4/8 clicked the "back" link  
* 2/8 used the back button on their browser 
* 1 skipped this step

[Request Clarification Study](./2021-11-request-clarification-research/research-findings.md#appointment-list-and-details-pages-navigation), 2021-11

Related appointments section. Most participants were pleased to see their related appointments in this context.

Along with wanting to see instruction for labs and x-rays, participants said it would be helpful to see:

* 3/8 - appointment type
* 3/8 - time
* 3/8 - clinic location

[Request Clarification Study](./2021-11-request-clarification-research/research-findings.md#related-appointments-section), 2021-11

Contact and best times to call pages

* 7/8 participants easily understood and completed the best times to call page.
  * One thought they were indicating best times to call on the request calendar, so found the page to be redundant.
* 8/8 participants reviewed the contact info page 
  * 4/8 expected their info would be updated across all VA systems if updated here.
  * 1 said he would prefer the option to do both.
