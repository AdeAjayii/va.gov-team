## Data needs

*Veterans need to understand what an appointment is for, who it's with, and where it is. Often this information is missing from the appointment.*

Missing, confusing appointment information makes the lists difficult to use.

[Appointment List Screenreader Usability Study](./2023-02-appt-list-usability-screenreader/research-findings.md#missing-confusing-appointment-information-makes-the-lists-difficult-to-use), 2023-02

Participants wanted to be able to easily differentiate between appointments. The most helpful data for this:  
* 7/9 Type of care
* 4/9 Clinic name - as it is called at the VA facility.
* 2/9 Whether the appointment was for, or connected to, labs.
