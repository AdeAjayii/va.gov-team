# Research Plan for [Appointments team, Appointment notifications, 9-27-2023]

## Background
The appointments team is thinking of ways to better the future appointment notifications, which is a crucial part of the authenticated experience for managing their health. We know that Veterans rely on different forms of notifications to be on top of managing their appointments, and staff at VA facilities use different systems to send out notifications. There could be excessive notifications, no notifications, or inconsistent notifications about the same appointment. From past studies, we know that systems are disconnected, and we need to streamline how we send out notifications, which requires additional technical discovery. The focus of this research is to understand Veterans’ preferences on appointment notifications, define the desired future state of appointment notifications, and prioritize what notifications experience the appointment team should build first.

### OCTO Priorities 
This research supports:

•	Integrate health portal features into VA.gov
•	Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran’s journey: 

•	Starting up 
•	Taking care of myself 
•	Retiring 
•	Aging

## Research Goals	
The focus of this study is to figure out what notifications Veterans find the most helpful for them when managing their appointments and appointment-related tasks so that our team can prioritize what to build and test first among the list of notifications below.

Here’s a list of appointment notifications that include what exists today and what we expect Veterans might need: 

•	Routine reminders to schedule appointments (e.g., annual physical exam) 
•	Request submitted
•	Appointments successfully scheduled confirmation (with dates, time, and location and how to modify)
•	Referral 
•	Appointments denied or for some reasons could not be scheduled (with next steps, and why (e.g., community care eligibility requirements)
•	Unable to contact Veterans to discuss the appointment
•	Reminder for upcoming appointments
•	Notify early appointment slot openings
•	Confirm and fill out pre-check-in and any questionnaires
•	Cancellation by VA
•	Cancellation confirmation by Veterans
•	Any changes about appointments
•	Reschedule confirmation
•	Updates on pending appointments
•	Check-in reminder
•	Checked in confirmation
•	Next steps for failed check-in
•	File for travel reimburse
•	Travel claims submission confirmation (submission confirmation and failed submission with next steps)
•	Travel claim approved
•	AVS ready to view 
•	Outstanding co-pay bills

The second goal is to find out how Veterans would like to receive notifications, for example, notifications can be sent separately, or notifications can be combined and sent in one email. 

### Outcome
This research will inform updates to the appointment notifications experience and help prioritize what appointment notifications to build first.

### Research questions
1.	Which appointment notifications are helpful for Veterans the most and the least? 
2.	How do Veterans prefer to receive their notifications? 
3.	What formats (text, email, phone call, or push notifications) do Veterans prefer to receive and for which notifications? 
4.	How do Veterans feel about receiving appointments and appointment-related notifications?

### Hypothesis
•	Some Veterans might not know how to manage their notifications, which causes them to receive no notifications or too many notifications. 
•	For a straightforward appointment (without canceling or rescheduling or other difficulties), Veterans only need 4 notifications, which are a reminder, check-in, AVS, and money-related (e.g., copay and travel pay) notifications. 
•	Veterans expect to receive email, text, and phone call notifications. 
•	Veterans might want to add their caregivers’ emails and phone numbers to receive notifications. 

## Methodology	
Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a survey activity that contains, respectively, 20-25 questions  (or less than 15 mins) for Veterans that may experience when getting appointment notifications. 
There are a total of 71 questions, and we will divide them up into 3 surveys due to the length of the questions. So, two of the surveys have 23 questions, and one survey has 25 questions. 
We would like to get complete responses from at least 35 Veterans for each survey, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA). Each cohort will access the study using a unique URL. 

### Location
This will be a survey that participants fill out remotely and asynchronously.

## Recruitment	
We will work with Perigean to handle the recruitment, scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**


## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

- 9/28: Kristen reviews for approval
- 9/28: Submit to research ops for approval
- 9/29: Pilot session (scheduled)
- 10/13: Kick-off meeting with Perigean

### Prepare
A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email: stephen.barrs@va.gov
* Date and time of pilot session: 9/29/2023

### Research sessions
* Survey will be open for 2 weeks, with the starting date TBD. 

### Length of sessions
* This is an asynchronous online survey. Participants are expected to spend no more than 20 minutes.
