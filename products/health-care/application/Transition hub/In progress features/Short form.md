## Feature background
The sign as a representative feature enables a representative with authority to make health care decisions for the Veteran to sign the application on behalf of the Veteran. A representative must upload a document that proves that they have legal authority to make health care decisions for the Veteran.

**Key notes:**
- We don't want to cause a blocker for application completion (avoid Caregiver applicants thinking that they also must be a legal health care representative of the Veteran)
- This feature is only shown to 50% of applicants because before the latest iteration, the program team was seeing about a 33% acceptance rate of documents uploaded. When a document can't be accepted, it must be followed up with a staff member. Too many unacceptable documents puts too much additional work on their team. 
- The latest iteration in production is showing improvement (still awaiting full report)
