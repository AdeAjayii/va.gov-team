CG Team is building feature for sign as rep
What attribute can they use/reference?
We haven't added flag for POA for payload
Online Health app team can tentatively add this in next sprint (6/15-6/28)
Staging environment can be used for testing
Ranga will share the schema with Lisa/Online Health app team

Planned Outages
Emails and a Slack message for planned outages would be great!
We can schedule these far in advance, so whenever we know something is coming up, we can set it up!
We will start the scheduled ‘maintenance window’ 15 minutes before scheduled outage
This will help avoid anyone coming back to submit during the window
We will use this for MPI outages as well
Messaging can be customized for more specific details, if needed

Potentially set up alerts in a dedicated channel with CG team
Real time
Look at our current alerts and see how to feed in to shared channel

Concern on vets-api retry
Central mail process can take time, and may mislead the applicant. If they call in for status, it will not be available and VA would not have it in the system to report on.
Unlikely to have API failure for 24+ hours
How long will it take to go thru central mail process?
Need to define user experience
Need to map out technical process flow before defining user experience
Where could it pass, fail, why and what happens (success codes, error codes, etc)
