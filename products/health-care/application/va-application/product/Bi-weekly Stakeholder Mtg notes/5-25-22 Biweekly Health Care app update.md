- I am preparing for a leadership briefing and wanted to know, how do I save the screenshots on the VA Form 10-10EZ mural page? : [10-10EZ screenshot flow](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.mural.co%2Ft%2Fadhoccorporateworkspace2583%2Fm%2Fadhoccorporateworkspace2583%2F1632923531828%2F474bfdde942c22a0df26ad416a0b23e36b834d4a%3Fsender%3Du6ad375c1c8425e5bfec67027&data=04%7C01%7C%7Caf25b8f042cd467237ae08d997bd1b4d%7Ce95f1b23abaf45ee821db7ab251ab3bf%7C0%7C0%7C637707660726820620%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=dk%2FIz5eg5ozGaZa4P0caP7sBN%2B4J2KCRK8vIqIWuJWk%3D&reserved=0)

Also these are the questions I will need to discuss at today’s meeting.  It will basically be like an update.  I have to brief upper Member Services leadership on the project timeline and progression.

- DEFINITIONS
     - Definitions are needed to clarify which path can be taken - Enrollment or Registration
     - 10-10 team clarified that we only have Enrollment pathway, not Registration pathway
     - Stacey Echols states that we should have the Registration path available online.
          - Requesting that a LOE be estimated
     - FYI - Per Stacey, there is less information needed for a Registration
     - The ES would need to be set up and ready to accept this information before online form implementation
     - Lauren requested HEC team to identify which fields are required for Registration vs Enrollment

- SHORT FORM -
     - What platform are we pulling the Veteran data from to pre-populate the fields on the short form?
          - MPI - Master Person Index, potentially other data sources
               - 10-10 team to confirm data sources we use to pre-populate the information on the form
          - Tarsha to check with Leadership on any concerns for Data Integrity
          - Dene’ to send spreadsheet showing the fields that are being pre-populated for logged in applicants

     - Have we performed a progression test to verify that it works correctly?
     - As part of the short form, have we implemented automatic qualifiers to skip sections within the application?
     - Is the short form active? If not, what is the estimated Go Live Date?
          - The Short Form is not live yet. Working through QA and Usability testing in the next few weeks.
     

- NOTIFICATIONS –
     - Define & implement a notification process such as, email or text reminder, if application was saved, but not completed.
          - We are in the process of implementing in-progress notifications emails with VA Notify team
     - Send an Email/text confirmation on final submission to Veterans preferred mode of communication.
          - ES sends confirmation email when submitted
               - Lauren & Patrick will check with Joshua Faulkner to confirm this
          - We send email if an error occurred
     - What is the estimated Go Live Date?
          - 2-4 weeks for In-progress Reminders

- ADDITIONAL SECTIONS –
     - SIGI - remains on the backlog with medium priority and has not been scoped into an ES release yet.
           - Tarsha verbally confirmed this today, informing Lindsey Peace (who asked if we were ready)
     - AMERICAN INDIAN HEALTH – This section is ready for production on the front end by the Digital Services team.  Josh Faulkner informed me that the back end is ready to receive data as well.  Can proceed with turning on this feature.  What is the estimated release data this feature will Go Live?  August 2022
          - Confirmed we are ready for this to deliver in August
     - After August release, we should compare paper and online form to make sure we are collecting the same info
