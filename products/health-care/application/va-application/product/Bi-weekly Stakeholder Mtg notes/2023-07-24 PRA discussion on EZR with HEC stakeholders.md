## 2023-07-24 Notes from HEC Stakeholder - PRA call on EZR

- Jessica Soza - Hosting
- Fran - PRA Liason for VHA
- Grant Bennett - Fran's supervisor
- Laura Arcadipane - Deputy director

### EZR - still focusing on the Form being online like the EZ

- Patrick
     - We are providing an update where the Veteran updates other stuff, we dont want to recreate the form online

- Fran
     - Requirements have to be approved through OMB 
     - Would be necessary to recreate
          - Require OMB
          - Require PRA review
          - Etc
- Patrick sum up
     - if we have a digital version of the form, we can take a subset and put it on VA.gov profile

- Fran
     - Considering separate OMB for Profile data collection
     - OMB says have to establish system of record to protect 
     - Information collection - own OMB control number
     - Not yet completed, engaging in next steps in the process to possibly implement this

- Fran 
     - There are reqs under PRA that limit using Profile to update forms
     - Mentioned that they didnt want to block Veterans from filling out the form because they are being forced to create a VA.gov profile
- Simone
     - Advocating for creating an account to update
- Patrick
     - We shouldnt forego authentication/fraud prevention just because it doesnt exist via US Mail
     - We will provide a link to download the form online for those who do not have an account

- Patrick
     - Demo of how Direct Deposit exists today
     - Options provided
          - Change online
          - Call
          - Go to office
          - Download form
          - Log in and update on Profile page

- Fran
     - Concern about OMB number & exp date not being on Profile page
     - Legal requirements must be met to collect the data, no matter which way
          - PRA
          - Privacy Act
          - Etc
     - Fields need to be roughly the same
- Shana
     - We are not re-creating anything
     - We planned to have the OMB, Privacy statement, etc on the screen
- Patrick
     - Agrees that we would pull in that required information
- Fran
     - Directive 6309 out there (coming?) with reqs for all VA forms
     - (summarizing) as long as we meet requirements, we should be ok
     - Would be a good idea to have OMB desk officer on call to review for meeting reqs after/during development
- Simone
     - Why is this not being done the same as EZ?
 - Patrick
     - We got more info about the requirements, and our demo tomorrow should provide clarity
