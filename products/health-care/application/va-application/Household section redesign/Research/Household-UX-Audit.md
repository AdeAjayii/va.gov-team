# Household Info UX Audit

Following up on the [Household info design discovery suggestions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/Household%20info%20design%20discovery.pdf), the team deciced to take the opportunity to conduct a broader UX audit, rather than immediately start solutioning based on the suggestions.

This UX audit focuses on broader issues with the form design of the 10-10EZ overall, using the household info section as a representative cross-section. The expectation is that some of the design suggestions from the previous discovery, and from this audit, be applied to the 10-10EZ (and possibly 10-10CG) overall.

## UX Best Practices

There are a number of form UX best practices that could benefit the household information section, and possibly the 10-10EZ overall.

### Nielsen Norman Recommendations

The [Nielsen Norman Top 10 Form Usability Recommendations](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/) is a list of common form UX principles, some of which can be applied to the household information section of the 10-10EZ.

- **Keep it short**
  - "Remove fields which collect information that can be (a) derived in some other way, (b) collected more conveniently at a later date, or (c) simply omitted."
- **Visually group related fields**
  - "Labels should be close to the fields they describe (immediately above the field for mobile and shorter desktop forms, or next to the field for extremely long desktop forms). Avoid ambiguous spacing, where labels are equidistant from multiple fields, and make sure to include the label attribute for screen readers."
- **Distinguish optional and required fields**
  - "First, eliminate as many optional fields as possible (see the first recommendation above). If some fields truly are necessary, but only apply to a subset of users, don’t make users find out through trial and error. Limit the form to only 1 or 2 optional fields, and clearly label them as optional."
- **Avoid *reset* or *clear* buttons**
  - "Provide a ‘Cancel’ button to support those users who abandon the form and want to delete their information. But make sure that the Cancel button has significantly less visual prominence than the Submit button, to avoid accidental clicks."
