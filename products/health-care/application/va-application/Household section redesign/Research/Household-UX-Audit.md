# Household Info UX Audit

Following up on the [Household info design discovery suggestions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/Household%20info%20design%20discovery.pdf), the team deciced to take the opportunity to conduct a broader UX audit, rather than immediately start solutioning based on the suggestions.

This UX audit focuses on broader issues with the form design of the 10-10EZ overall, using the household info section as a representative cross-section. The expectation is that some of the design suggestions from the previous discovery, and from this audit, be applied to the 10-10EZ (and possibly 10-10CG) overall.
