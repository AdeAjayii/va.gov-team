## Problem
Veterans are either not completing the application due to additional information that is required but may not be necessary; or may not be completing due to the amount of time required to complete the application.
The introduction of the short form will remove questions that are not necessary for a given Veteran's circumstances, and reduce the amount of time and effort required to complete the initial form.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Shorten the amount of time taken to complete the application.
- Reduce the number of visits required to complete the application.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Confusion about what information needs to be provided and what doesn't.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Fewer applications are abandoned.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Confusion on what information needs to be filled out, leading to Veterans abandoning applications.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - The value risk is that applicants will ignore the reminders. They could also route these emails to their spam/junk folder without realizing what it is for.  
  - There is also a risk that an email cannot be sent, if the Veteranâ€™s profile does not include an email address.
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - There is a risk that, if the applicant is routed to My VA (via a link in the email when there is more than one in-progress application), they can be confused as to why they were not routed to the application itself.
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
   - TBD
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Increase in applicant returns and submissions of in-progress applications


### Solution Summary
- In-scope:
     - Reminder Email to be sent through VA Notify template process for applications that are still in progress
     - Email will be sent using the profile ID of the logged in applicant
- Out of scope:
     - Confirmation emails
     - Any other email notifications
     - Using data within the application (such as the email address entered)
     - Applications started while unauthenticated, which would not be saved in progress
