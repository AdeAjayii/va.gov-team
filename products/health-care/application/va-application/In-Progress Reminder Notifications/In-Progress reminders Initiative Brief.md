## Problem
Veterans are not able to complete applications, and may be forgetting that they have an application in progress.  They may also not know how to return to it.
The reminders will encourage the Veteran to submit the application in order to receive benefits sooner. The link in the reminder email will take them back to the in progress application.


## Desired User Outcomes

- Shorten the time the application remains "in progress"
- Fewer expired applications
- More returns and submissions of saved applications

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Frustration in overcomplicated notifications or too many notifications
- More complex application workflow to get to "in progress" application

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Veterans are reminded of in progress applications and return to complete them

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Confusion on submission status that leads to more expired applications
