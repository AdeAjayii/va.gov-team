_recording accepted_

M: Do you currently have VA health care?

P: Yes

M: Do you remember that process of how you got it?

P: Vaguely, I got into the system and didn't use it for a long time and then got back into it a couple of years ago.

M: Curious if you'd applied online or not and if this would be a familiar experience or not.

P: I think I applied online, I was living in Cincinnati and going there and kind of signed up online when I got to Jacksonville, I live here now. I'm using VOC (Vocational)rehab. So I got setup to see all of my doctors down here and setup the VOC rehab.

M: Feel free to let me know if this looks familiar or not.

P: ok

M: According to my intake paperwork, it says that you are screenreader user, is that right?

P:Yeah, it's not like a requirement for me, it's just that I get distracted easily, so I use a reader to digest the knowledge, not for a vision thing.

M: That makes sense, feel free to do what you'd normally do for this study. If you'd use it, feel free. 

M: link in zoom chat, if you do decide to use screenreader, please make audio available for us to hear as well, if that's ok. And if you don't want to use it that's ok too, it's your choice. 

M: How long have you been using a reader?

P: For about two years. I just finished my associates. I hadn't been to school in a long time, a lot of the educational resources and books are online so it's easier to use a reader.

(share screen)

M: Do you plan to use a screen reader?

P: Just depends if I have to read all of that, because if I have to read all of that, then maybe, but if it's just pecking around, I probably won't have to use it.

M: Sure, feel free to use as you want, and you don't have to make a decision right now.

M: Ok, to get us started, let's say that you don't have VA health care, and found out you could apply online, walk me through what you'd do once you got here.

P: Well I'm kind of looking for apply, so I guess I'd click this blue button (sign in to check your application status button) but it says sign in to check your application status. There's no button...

M: You're looking for?

P: Yeah I thought there'd be a big blue button that says "start application" vs. the sign in...I mean there are steps to get started, so I start with reading through all these steps...(reading) start your application, so I assume that I'd choose one of these two (sign in to start your application button or start your application link). 

M: Do you have a VA login?

P: I should, but I couldn't tell you my login, I'd have to look it up. haha

M: No problem we're not going to sign in today, let's continue in the application as if you were going to sign up, but without signing in.

M: You're here. Go ahead and start filling it out, if you notice anything tell me, and I'll stop you if I have any questions. 

P: It asked for a middle, but it's not required

M: What were you think ing when you got to that last page? (Veteran name in application, after screener)

P: That it kind of looked exactly like the page before it, it's kind of redundant, but I guess I'm used to it.

M: Oh really? from what?

P: Like the VA or anything medical related, even Amazon. Give your information billing info and mailing it's redundant. 

P: I do find it kind of odd that it has the progress bar and we're still on step 1 and the blue progress bar hasn't moved and I've clicked like 6 times. It's different, not bad, but I'd expect it to advance each time I click continue.

M: You said different, not bad, can you explain that?

P: I've done tons of training in my last job and to me if I was an older person, I'd think I'm doing something wrong, but it's not changing. But it's not bad, because nothing has gone wrong and I can still fill out information, so I'd have to assume it's ok.

M: What's your expectation on how long it's going to be?

P: I'd say I wouldn't have an expectation or that it's going to be long, because I've already pushed continue 3-4 times and it hasn't...even at school I like to know how many questions a test is when I get into it. Like am I answering 20 or 60, because then you have an idea of how to regulate your time. Here, it hasn't told me how many pages I have to click through to get to the end.

M: making sure I capture you right, it doesn't provide you with any indication of how long or how many questions, right?

P: Right, I wouldn't know how many steps, even thought I've clicked 3-4 times, each step could be 1 question or 20 questions. It doesn't really tell you.

P: I always click to the bottom to see if I need the info, but so far it has been all the same.

P: (on birth sex question): I mean, not that it bothers me, but at this point, I'm kind of surprised they don't have an "other" or "non-binary."
 Just because, going to college right now, everything says like female, male, non-binary, or prefer not to say/choose, something like that.
 
 M: Yeah definitely.
 
 P: Prefer not to answer- that's what it'd normally say.
 
 P: (on address) Oh see, "is your home address same as your mailing address" just like I was saying with Amazon, so yes, yes it is.
 
 M: Right
 
 P: (on benefits page Yay I'm on step 2
 
 P: (on military service) See one question for step 2
 
 M: What were you thinking about right then.
 
 P: Just like what we were talking about before.
 
 M: You called it
 
 P: Yeah it's kind of a crapshoot
 
 M: Which it is if it's not indicating
 
 P: I don't remember my start date, i mean it doesn't matter
 
 M: (on upload discharge papers) You don't have to upload, just curious if this was real, would you have that or have to stop to go get it?
 
 P: Like my DD214?
 
 M: mmhmm
 
 P: Um, I'd have to go...well I'm on the fence on that one, I'm sure I have a digital copy somewhere, but I'd have to go find it. I do have an electronic copy, but everything got moved so I have to go find it. I also have a scanner if I had to. I could do this, but it wouldn't be an immediate thing.
 
 P: Do you need me to upload a document?
 
 M: Curious, if this was real and you were signed in and could save it. Would you save it and then come back? or would you pause, go get it, and continue within same session?
 
 P: "I would definitely pause and go look for it. That's one thing I wish with the VA, I wish it was more streamlined, I wish that there was some kind of  way ...almost like ID.me or other things, where I could just use that, because there is somewhere a record of my dd214 or my disability rating and all that stuff, versus me always having to find my disability rating letter or an electronic copy of dd214. Because to me, if I were to complain, which I am, it doesn't make sense that the people that use those two things, don't have that readily available for Veterans who are trying to use the benefits that they have through the VA.

M: Makes total sense.

P: So here (financial disclosure page) I want to know what recently means. (Bullet list "recently discharged combat Veteran) It should say in parentheses what the threshhold should be.


M: Like how many years is considered recent?

P: Yeah that's what I mean, is it a year? Is it less than a year?

M: Yeah, makes sense. What's your assumption. 

P: I assume I don't fall under this, just assuming with the government, I'd guess 60-90 days or at most a year, because at a year, you're pushing it with "recently."

M: Noting that it's not clear.

P: Yeah. 

P: (selects yes to financial disclosure) See here, I would expect it to dropdown after click yes, as opposed to continue to the next page.

P: It's not bad, it's just adding another step when you're already here.

M: Yeah, good to hear your expectations, and as far as that page, overall do you have any thoughts. 

P: For me, I think it's about as straightforward as it can be, it's just kind of weird because I read all of that in terms of financial disclosure and then I click that, yes, and then it never asked about financial disclosure, and then I click continue and it asks me about household information. But I would think, that it'd immediately ask me for my household income. 

P: (clicks on yes to dependents to report, dropdown opens) See like that.

M: That's what you expected on the..?

P: Yeah, it asks me if I have dependets, I click yes, and the it immediately asks me for the stuff.

M: And this is what you thought it'd do on that financial page, right?

P: Right.

P: (on when did they become your dependent question) "See now this one, I mean it's... I don't want to say...I mean it is straightforward, but then it makes me stop and pause because it says what their birth date was and then it asks me when they became a dependent, and that's another thing that I really honestly couldn't remember when I put them in as a dependent to the VA, like I don't think I even have a document stating when I added them as a dependent. Like I remember it happening, like I think I talked to someone on the phone versus like getting a letter, like if it was a month or two after he was born or something like that, I don't really remember.

M: Makes sense, so if you were really filling this out, what would you do?

P: "Kind of panic, because like I said, I don't know where I'd get this information, I'd guess and put his birthday, but that might not be accurate." So I think for my second son it was pretty immediate. Because I was in school and someone said if you're planning to have any more kids, be ready to add them immediately to your thing because they're a dependent. Because with my first son, it was likely a good while before I added him into the system, it's not something I thought about, because I wasn't married in the military, I got married way after.

P: (on Veteran's other income amount) So this one always get me too. I get a stipend, like VA, like a month dollar amount, then from my disability and then I get a stipend from VOC rehab so I never know if this goes in here. And I don't necessarily think that's a form problem, it's jsut an organizational problem, because I never know when to add them together, when to not include my disability. Or if I do need to include this, because it says other income, so I would assume that I would add my VOC rehab in here, but I never really know.

M: Right...but it's not clear...So if you were really filling it out you would add the VOC rehab in but not the VA compensation, is that right?

P: Yeah only because that one is basically for my medical disabilities so it's to cover the medical side of it, so I don't really consider it an income. Whereas VOC rehab is a work program and an educational program so I do kind of consider it an extra income, it's what we use it for. So like I'm not working, my spouse works fulltime, so that's like my contribution. So that's why I'd consider it an other income.

M: I hear you, maybe we should be more clear on what to include.

P: Yeah and I mean it gets tough on the other hand, I've done this type of thing before, and you don't want to put too many entry blocks. I just wonder if this is important for someone. If I'm filling this out for medical reasons, is that other income important for someone. and if it is, do you have a line for VA compensation, VOC rehab. or GI bill, you'd have a million lines. Very user dependent. I don't know, "but like my complaint, when it comes to filling things out in terms of income with the VA, I've never really understood what they consider an income. In terms of compensation adn VOC rehab- which is what I consider an income. 

P: (on amount you or your spouse paid in non-reimbursable medical expenses this past year.) So this one right here, I don't feel like I'd have that readily available. Very user specific, but my wife deosn't use the VA for anything, so I wonder why they need to know that, like is it important to someone? Clearly since it's required, because I use both. Like I use the VA for my disability stuff, but I don't use them for like wellness visits or anything like that. That was always unclear for me, and I think some things changed, but i was told that anything related to my service-connected disability, I wouldn't pay for, but now because I provided my insurance card to them, because they asked for it, and now my doctor's visits and prescriptions, I'm now paying for it. Which I don't complain because I get that disability compensation so that's my assumption that I pay for it with that, but no one ever told me that that's the case. So that's what I'm saying, I don't understand what the outide of the VA has to do with me applying for medical benefits. 

M: So knowing what you know now, but still filling this out, what would you put in here?

P: A real answer is I'd ask my wife. Because she keeps track of that. I'm not working, in VOC rehab, so I think she has a website through her insurance where she can check that, so I'd probably get that number, because they're asking for it. But still not sure why they need it.

M: Do you think it'd be helpful on this page, if it gave maybe a reason why it's asking and how it'd be used.

P: Yeah I guess. Because to me it doesn't make sense why my outside medical, I know they're trying to integrate, so that anything they do wouldn't be conflicting with your regular doctors, but yeah. As my expectations as a Veteran, I don't know what any of my outside stuff has to do with the VA, because I kind of think anything with the VA is strictly based on what I did in my time in the military. 

P: (Amount your paid for educational expenses) "This one is kind of tough for me. Because like VOC rehab, not to complain about it all the time, but they hypothetically pay for everything, but then they don't. Like, the VOC rehab is a benefit for a Veteran, but the biggest problem with VOC rehab, is like when you're trying to get benefits from the VA, you have to fight for it, which I find asinine. They want to say VOC rehab is a benefit, but then I have a VOC counselor, and I don't expect the government to just give me anything I ask for, but if I need anything it's usually denied. Because they have a framework that they utilize. Trying to think of an example. Something stupid, but they provided me with this computer that I'm on now, because I didn't have a working computer to attend a class online, and my entire associate's was online because of covid. And they provided an older, cheaper computer for a technology program, and what I've had to do, because this computer got really slow, even to the point where it'd tell me it was going to kick me out when I'd be in a quiz or test because it didn't have enough RAM becuase it's so slow, and I reached out about getting upgraded RAM and was immediately denied, so I went ahead and paid for it and installed it myself, because I can, but if it were someone else
