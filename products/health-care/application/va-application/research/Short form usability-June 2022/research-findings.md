## Research Goals 

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Determine whether or not the short form flow is usable and understandable when it is pre-populated at start of authenticated application
- Determine whether or not the short form flow is usable and understandable when it is based on a self-reported, service-connected disability pay for a 50% or higher rating
- Confirm that no changes were made to the full application due to out short form updates
- Determine whether or not the flow and copy sets proper expectations for the application experience

As a secondary goal, we will also take special note of any participant feedback throughout the application. 

## Research Methodology 

**Task analysis**

We conducted 1 pilot + 10 participant remote, task-based usability studies, with Zoom, using the Perigean contract. Each moderated session was approximately 1 hour long for non-screen readers and approximately 1.5 hours for screen reader users, in which we asked participants to talk about their health care application experience and fill out one of our 10-10EZ short form flows. The moderator began with introduction questions and prompted participants with guiding questions (from the [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/Short%20form%20usability-June%202022/conversation-guide.md). Participants were shown one of three staging prototyped flows:

1. 3 participants: Short form based on pre-populated disability rating of 50% or higher at application start (Signed in to fake staging account and moderator share screen)
2. 3 participants + 1 as a task: Short form based on self-reported disability rating of 50% or higher on VA compensation question 
3. 4 participants: Full application, this is our control group, thy had 40% or less disability rating and

## Research Questions

The research questions we sought to address: 
- Are users able to navigate through the pre-populated short form easily and without confusion?
- Are users able to navigate through the short form based on self-reported information easily and without confusion?
- Does the green expandable alert cause annoyance or feel repetitive?
- Do users understand what the short form is?
- Do users understand why they can fill out a short form?
- What is the overall sentiment about this short form experience?
- Has anything changed on the full application due to the short form (it shouldn't)?


## Key Findings

**General**
1. 100% of participants who received the short form (6) were able to move through the application without indication of a block
2. All paeticipants who recieved the short form expressed that it exceeded their expectations of time (shorter than they expected)
3. Most participants who recieved the short form expressed that is was simple and easy. 
4. A couple of participants worried that if they filled out a shortened application that they would later be asked to provide that information. This sentiment was also shared by some participants who recieved the full application had wondered the dame thing if they were not to provide their DD214 and financial information, but short form participants didn't indicate that this would block them from completion. 
5. Some participants think that there's no reason to tell the user that they are getting a shorter application.


**Specific to short form**
1. Wrapping on green alert on mobile looks a little weird
2. The Blue confirm box could be improved to provide more transparency (a couple of the participants expressed worry that they would be missing something)
3. Many self-disclose participants missed the alert after confirmation (the "you are now on step 3 of 4)
4. Not all participants opened the green alert, but the majority acknowledged its existence. Those that opened, received it positively, especially because it indicated the specific sections that would be skipped (military and income).
5. Some participants wondered why it was for 50% but not 40%.
6. The edit compensation flow from review page is not ideal, but didn't indicate signs of drop-off.

**Specific to screen reader users**
1. The screener is very confusing and both participants indicated that they think something is wrong or they made a mistake, this is compunded by the progress bar/stpes, not advancing as expected.
2. One particpants screen reader kept reading many fields as "date" when it had nothing to do with a date
3. One participant's screen reader didn't read many of the question labels on the first time, so often the particpant would guess at an answer (resulting in some misinformation) or they would have to start and reread from the top.
4. As the particpants advanced through the form by pushing the continue button, sometimes they would land on the next screen at the top, other times at the bottom. (this is not consistent)
5. One question per page might not be ideal for screen reader users.

**Other observations**
1. The screener at the beginning is very confusing for participants (3). Some participants think they made a mistake. This is amplified for screen reader users. 
2. The progress bar continue to be confusing and doesn't set proper expectations or give indicator of how many questions exist/ remain
3. The majority of participants (8) expect that a confirmation email will be sent with everything that the application confirmation screen has. Email is the preffered contact method.
4. The start application buttons and links cause confusion
  - At top participants are wondering what to do if they haven't already filled out an application
  - In the save time, save your work in progress, this is not a proper header, and doesn't support natural finding of the start application (both for authenticated and unauthenticated users). Some users struggle to even get into the application.
5. The majority of participants (5) struggled to answer the Medicaid question, they felt that they should be provided with what the eligibility is for Medicaid, some indicated signs of drop-off.
6. The VA facility page caused confusion in the majority of participants (5).
  - The list is not in alphabetical order (makes it difficult to find in a long list)
  - The list is mixed with some locations having a name and some having a city (not a consistent way to find)
  - 1 Participant used the VA locator, but found it there, but then it wasn't on the application list to select
  - 1 Participant expected it to cross state lines because those are closer (expected a radius search)
7. The minimum essential coverage question caused some confusion, especially because it is under the VA facility header (this is amplified even more for screenreader users)
8. Other insurance page continues to be a pain point with the majority (5) of participants indicating some signs of confusion
  - Why does the VA need this? and am I going to be charged?
  - Should I include Tricare, Medicare Advantage
  - What is a significant other?
9.  The financial and greater household information section continues to be a pain point
  - Why does VA need to know this?
  - Confusion about gross/net- isn't this just before and after tax?
  - Confusion as to if they should include VA benefits as income, 
  - What to put for education and health-related costs when it is _supposed to be_ fully covered by VA, but it isn't
  - Dependents- when they becamse a dependent - is this for official VA denpendent or just when they became a dependent of the Veteran?

10. The majority of participants interacted with the review page very positively
  - Found it easy to scan information
  - Found it easy to edit


## Key Findings - (to be updated)

### T - (to be updated)







## Recommendations

**Content changes**
1. Remove the text on the authenticated immediate alert page (usually place of birth) that says: " You don't have to fill in all of these fields. But we can review your application faster iof you provide more information. <img width="582" alt="Screen Shot 2022-06-24 at 8 57 28 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80857940/175540646-5585893c-402f-4e06-b2bd-eee73ec705b4.png">

**Short form-specific screens**

1. Authenticated immediate alert
     - Consider adding which sections are skipped (similar to the green alert)- military and income
     - Check mobile for wrapping

2. Blue alert
  - Consider editing the more info component to be less vague

3. Step 3 of 4 alert
  - (maybe) consider styling more like the green alert because that one was seen more than this one

4. Green expandable alert
  - Check mobile for wrapping

## Next Steps

1. Update short form-specific content
2. Publish short form
3. Monitor comparative now vs. after completion and drop-off rates


###  In the future
* Update how compensation question can be edited from review page
* Redesign the beginning "screener" flow
* Update Medicaid page- consider adding who is eligible
* Update VA facility page
  - Remove minimum essential coverage from VA facility header
  - Provide a way to search by distance/radius
  - Make list consistent with name of clinic and location
  - Alphabatize the list
* Consider adding more context to the other information page
* Update household information section, integrating above findings as much as possible
* Update intro page- especially the buttons/links to start (placement and heading content)
* Check all fields with screen reader to ensure that the question is read properly
* Check each page with screen reader to ensure that it moves people to expected region on every page
* Conduct more mobile testing (noticed screen moves from right to left, and some alerts/content wrap visually strangely)
