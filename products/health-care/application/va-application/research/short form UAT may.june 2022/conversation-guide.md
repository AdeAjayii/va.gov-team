## Intro - 2 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Den√© and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. We're working on adding a new feature that reduces the length of the health care applications for Veterans. The purpose of our session today is to make sure that the feature is working as expected in your account and that you're able to interact with it as intended.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* **We will be able to see your real information today.** This may include some personal information such as address, phone number,and Social Security numbers as well as your date of birth and marital status, military service history, and income. During any of the tasks if you feel uncomfortable sharing your screen with any of your information on it, feel free to stop screensharing and start again when you feel comfortable.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

_(I don't plan to record these sessions)_

As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked what your service-connected disability rating is. According to the info I got, you have a service-connected disability rating of %. Is that correct? _The % determines which flow they will go on_
