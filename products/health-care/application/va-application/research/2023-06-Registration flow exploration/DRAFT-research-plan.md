# DRAFT Research Plan for health care application Priority Groups/financial updates research study [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, June 2023]

## Background
The online health care application (10-10EZ) and update form (10-10EZR) both can impact a Veteran's eligibilty and placement in a Priority Group. This is more so impactful for those who need to have income information considered for copays or Priority Group placement.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
- Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims 


### Veteran Journey
- This fits accross the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from getting out to aging.
- This impacts a **key moment that matters** in that Veterans need to select the health care coverage according to their individual needs and preferences and that is the best fit for them. 


## Research Goals	

Learn more about Veteran's mental model when applying for health care benefits including the terms they use and how they see levels of benefits/Priority Groups/copays impacting them during the health care application process, during and ongoing after.

Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about applying, discovering eligibility and getting the most health care benefits they qualify for and what amount of information they feel they need to provide in that process. 

Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about providing updated information, especially financial and dependent updates, that could impact their health care benefits post-application/initial enrollment.


### Outcome
We will use these findings to:
- Check assumptions and terminology used to remain Veteran-centric 
- Develop insights into an ideal state and how Veteran would prefer to navigation the health care benefits application journey
- Develop insights early during initial design discovery phase and iterate 


### Research questions



Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about applying, discovering eligibility and getting the most health care benefits they qualify for and what amount of information they feel they need to provide in that process. 
- What is the Veteran's mental model of discovering, getting and keeping health care benefits as they go through the application process?
- What is the Veterans perception of eligibility and Priority Groups when they are completing the application?
- Do Veterans feel most information the VA has and they should not have to provide?

Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about applying, discovering eligibility and getting the most health care benefits they qualify for.
- What are the Veteran's current pain points with how the health care application impacts the overall benefits journey?
- What is the order and process expectations of Veterans when they are applying (registering or enrolling) for health care benefits?
- When does it make sense to Veterans to go thorugh eligibiltiy based questions? (before, during or after application)


Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about providing updated information, especially financial and dependent updates, that could impact their health care benefits post-application/initial enrollment.
- Do Veterans call out the VA profile or MyHelatheVet or the mobile app or (enter here) as their ideal way to provide this updated information in an online setting?
- Do Veterans prefer to provide updated information in person at appointments?
- Would Veterans prever to be prompted to provide updated financials?




### Hypothesis
- We assume the overall process of determining eligibility and being placed in a Priority Group is somewhat unclear to Veterans today.
- We assume not all Veterans go through the enrollment process in one go, there is often stops, such as an exam and other claims filed in between. 
- We assume that Veterans who have health care regularly login to VA.gov / Profile 
- 

## Methodology	
- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research


Additional desk research will be conducted to supplement these interviews:
- Google analytics path and keyword study
- VSignals analysis around keywords (?)


### Location
Remote via Zoom for the interviews

### Research materials

## Timeline

Thursday July 6 -  Wednesday July 19




### Prepare
* Pilot participant email: 
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:
* Cohort 1: Thursday July 6 - Friday July 7
* Cohort 2: Monday July 17 - Wednesday July 19
* Cohort 3: Wednesday July 26 - Friday July 28

### Length of sessions
* Session length:  < 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
* Maximum Sessions per day: 4

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
