## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about the health care application process.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Cohort 1) - 3 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

## First Topic: [Cohort 1 - Current Process] - 5 minutes

- What was your experience like getting setup for that appointment beforehand or did you just walk in?
- Can you describe your experience with any forms or sign up information that you had to complete to apply to be seen for care? [Not saying your "registration experience, but would they have filled out an EZ?]

- Would you rather do the research yourself or be told what you qualify for?
- Did you want to only get care for one specific health concern, or were you interested in getting full health care coverage?
- Looking back now after you have been using health care benefits, is there anything you wish you would have known during the application?

### Things to watch for:
- [How does the Veteran descirbe the process of figuring out what they are eligble for - are they frustrated, do they find it easy, do they just expect the VA to have the data and figure it out for them?]
- [Is there a mix or preference for wanting to be told what they get or search it out on their own?]

- [Do they know and mention their Priority Group during these questions?]

- [What do they mention or call out as information that is helpful in making decisions about health care benefit choices?]





## Fourth Topic: [Scenario 1 - Cohort 1] - 10 minutes
**Scenario setup**
- For this first scenario, let's imagine you are want to apply and sign up for health care, but you don't know what you qualify for or know what benefits you would get. You do some online research and arrive at a page where you can apply for health care benefits, still being uncertain of your eligibility.
- At the start of the application, you are presented with a choice where you can pick one of these options or both. The choices are 1. enrollment for full medical benefits or 2. registration for care or for the full medical benefits. 

**Questions**
- What would you choose? Can you explain your thinking to us?
- What information would you need to confidently make a choice on what type of benefits you are choosing to apply for?
- What are your thoughts on how this is worded? Would you like to call the steps in this process something else?
- How would you feel if you selected one of these benefits and found out after the application that you are not elligible and should have chosen the other benefit option?

## Fifth Topic: [Scenario 2 - Cohort 1] - 10 minutes
**Scenario setup**
- For this second scenario, let's imagine again you are applying for health care online and you arrive at a page that explains the process and outlines the various health care benefit packages and levels clearly. 
- You start the application by answering a few basic questions about who you are, where you live and how you can be contacted. You then complete some basic questions about any health care coverage you may already have as well as confirming your military service history. 
- Next you are preseneted with a series of yes/no questions that walk you through an eligibility screening basically. Once this is completed, you are told what benefit package you could possibly qualify for or it is determined you need to continue on with more questions and provide additional info such as your income and how many dependents you have. But if you are told you qualify based on the initial screening, you don't have to answer these other questions.
- Once you are done, you are told a benefit type and level (or range) that you might qualify for. 

**Questions**
- What are your initial reactions or thoughts on this process?
- Does anything stand out to you as helpful or annoying?
- Would you find a lot of yes/no questions that could be related to your service connected disability or medical situation in the middle of the application intrusive?
- Would you want to know on the spot during the application what level (Priority Group) you might be eligible for or are you fine with waiting to hear from the VA?
- What information do you think you need to provide to get placed into the correct type and level of benefits?



## Fourth Topic: [Scenario 1 - Cohort 2] - 10 minutes
**Scenario setup**
- For this scenario, let's imagine you are applying for health care online and you arrive at a page that explains the process as registering for care and then deciding to enroll to receive the full medical benefits package after an eligibility screening. During the initial application you are registering for care and you create a profile, enter some basic information about yourself and answer if you currently have any other health care coverage as well as your military service information.  
- After you complete the questions to register for care, you are then given the option to wait to hear about your initial eligibility screening or you can enroll for the full medical benefits package right away and answer some additional questions. However, if you decide to complete enrollment at a later time, it is easy for you to sign back in and complete the enrollment questions. 

**Questions**
- What is your perception of this scenario and what issues, if any, do you see in this for yourself?
- Would needing to return later and complete more questions be frustrating to you? 
- Would you rather complete all tasks/information needed in one sitting even if you have to provide more information than you may need to?



## Fifth Topic: [Scenario 2 - Cohort 2] - X minutes
TBD - the preferred scenario from cohort 1

## Fourth Topic: [Scenario 1 - Cohort 3] - X minutes
TBD
## Fifth Topic: [Scenario 2 - Cohort 3] - X minutes
TBD




## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Out of the 2 scenarios that were talked through with you, what one would you prefer out of those and why?
- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
- Any questions for me? 


## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
