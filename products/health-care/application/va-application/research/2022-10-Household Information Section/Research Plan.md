# [DRAFT] Research Plan for 10-10 Team, Health care application 10-10EZ household information section, October 2022

## Background
> Briefly describe the background of your product. Consider:
> - What problem is your product trying to solve?
> - Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)
> - What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?


The Health Care Application (10-10EZ) enables Veterans to access and apply for VA Health care easily with any device at any time, with or without assistance. Veterans can do this both as an unauthenticated user or as an authenticated one where they can also check their application status once signed in. This is an existing product and this research study is focusing on an iteration of one specific section, household information, which includes adding both financial information and dependents. 

The household information section, step 4 out of 6 in the application progress flow, has been identified as a problem area through past research (discovery research findings link and/or short form usability?) and page analytics. Initial problem discovery



- Product | [10-10EZ Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/10-10EZ%20Health%20Care%20Application%20Product%20Outline.md)
- UX audit link? Ticket or Mural?
- User flows link



### OCTO Objectives 

> Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

**Increase**
- Usage of digital, self- service tools
- Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)
- Completion rate of online transactions

**Decrease**
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
- Time to successful complete and submit online transactions
- Time to process online applications (vs. paper)


### Veteran Journey
> Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
> Are there moments that matter? 



## Research Goals	
1. Optimize the order and flow of questions within the household information section
2. Determine if the questions and contextual information is clear and actionable
3.  Esablish a qualitative baseline to aid in measuring the usability impacts of changes made


### Outcome
> How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

The outcomes of this research will help in ensuring the content and flow of the household information section questions is clear and easy for the Veteran/applicant to follow along and complete without abandonment.


### Research questions
> Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
> - What will I do with what I learn from this question?
> - Does this question serve the goals of my study?
> - Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

- Within the household information section (step 4) of the 10-10EZ health care application, do the questions occur in an **order that is logical** to Veterans/applicants?
- Are the questions worded and explained with additional context in a way that is **clear and understandable** to the Veterans/applicants?
- What is **easy or difficult and why** for the Veteran/applicant as they work through the household information questions?


### Hypothesis
> What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
> - What do you already know about this problem space?
> - What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
> - Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
> - Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

The new pattern to add and edit dependents 
The content explaining the various financial areas (gross income, net and other) is easy to digest now that it is broken up into sections and placed in relation to the corresponding text field. 

## Methods

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: TBD - 30 minutes to 1 hour (need to test once conversation guide ready)
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 2

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
