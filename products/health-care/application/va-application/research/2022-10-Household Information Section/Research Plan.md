# [DRAFT] Research Plan for 10-10 Team, Health care application 10-10EZ household information section, October 2022

## Background
The Health Care Application (10-10EZ) enables Veterans to access and apply for VA Health care easily with any device at any time, with or without assistance. Veterans can do this either as an unauthenticated user or as an authenticated user. This is an existing product and this research study is focusing on an iteration of one specific section, household information. This section includes questions on:
- Financial Disclosure
- Marital Status
- Spouse's Information & Dependents
- Annual Income
- Deductible Expenses

The household information section, step 4 out of 6 in the application progress flow, has been identified as a pain point through [past research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/Household%20info%20design%20discovery.pdf). [Page analtyics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/april-may-2021/end-user-discovery/10-10EZ%20Discovery%20Research%20readout.pdf) indicating it is the area of the form with a high drop-off rate. Initial discovery of this problem space began with an [UX audit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/Household%20section%20redesign/Research/Household-UX-Audit.md) that included looking at usability best practices and competitive research lens, prior to starting design. The [propsed new flow](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/p/AE225764-D5BB-4CE6-9577-38E8F570392B/canvas) and designs include rearranging the order of the questions, updating the content to plain language standards and design pattern updates around multiple responses (list and loop) used when adding dependents.


- Product | [10-10EZ Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/10-10EZ%20Health%20Care%20Application%20Product%20Outline.md)


### OCTO Objectives 
**Increase**
- Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)
- Completion rate of online transactions

**Decrease**
- Time to successful complete and submit online transactions
- Time to process online applications (vs. paper)


### Veteran Journey
The Health Care Application fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) at the following stages:
- Getting out
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself

## Research Goals	
**1. Optimize the order and flow of questions within the household information section**

**2. Determine if the questions and contextual information is clear and actionable**

**3. Esablish a qualitative baseline to aid in measuring the usability impacts of changes made**


### Outcome
The outcome of this research will help guide what changes should be made to the household information to make it easier for Veterans/applicants to complete this section without leaving the application. A secondary outcome is providing a qualitative baseline of the current usability of the household information pages. 


### Research questions
- How do the **proposed design and content changes compare to the existing** pages in the opinion of the Veteran/applicant?
- Within the household information section (step 4) of the 10-10EZ health care application, do the questions occur in an **order that is logical** to Veterans/applicants?
- Are the questions worded and explained in a way that is **clear and understandable** to the Veterans/applicants or is additional context and explanation needed?
- What is **easy or difficult and why** for the Veteran/applicant as they work through the household information questions?


### Hypothesis
- The new pattern to add and edit dependents has less cognitive load for the applicant and takes less time to complete.
- The content explaining the various financial areas (gross income, net and other) is easy to digest now that it is broken up into sections and placed in relation to the corresponding text field. 
- The financial information question is well received and the onboarding page provides the Veteran/applicant with the information they need to proceed easily through this section of the applicaiton.
- In comparision to the existing pages, participants will prefer the new designs with content changes. 



## Methods

### Baseline Analysis
- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research

Establishing a qualitative baseline by asking questions with visuals/screen captures showing focused parts of the existing site and new designs.


### Task Analysis
- Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research

The usability test for task analysis will be on a desktop prototype that is built to only include the household information section and will skip over other sections of the form but provide context for the participant.


### Location
Remote: Zoom

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
> Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

We will recruit Veterans for this research and use Perigean to recruit participants. 

> Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.


### Recruitment criteria
|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
|      15       |          10      |10       |             |          |               | 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
> What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

> Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
> What criteria would strengthen your results? 



## Timeline
> Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

October - November 2022 

### Prepare
> When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

> A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: TBD


### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 2

### Availability
> When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
