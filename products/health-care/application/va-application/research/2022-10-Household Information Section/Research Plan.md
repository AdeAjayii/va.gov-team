# [DRAFT] Research Plan for 10-10 Team, Health care application 10-10EZ household information section, October 2022

## Background
The Health Care Application (10-10EZ) enables Veterans to access and apply for VA Health care easily with any device at any time, with or without assistance. Veterans can do this either as an unauthenticated user or as an authenticated user. This is an existing product and this research study is focusing on an iteration of one specific section - household information. This section includes questions on:
- Financial Disclosure
- Marital Status
- Spouse's Information & Dependents
- Annual Income
- Deductible Expenses

The household information section, step 4 out of 6 in the application progress flow, has been identified as a pain point through [past research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/Household%20info%20design%20discovery.pdf) and [page analtyics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/april-may-2021/end-user-discovery/10-10EZ%20Discovery%20Research%20readout.pdf) indicating it is the area of the form with a high drop-off rate. Initial discovery of this problem space began with an [UX audit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/Household%20section%20redesign/Research/Household-UX-Audit.md) that included looking at usability best practices and competitive research lens, prior to starting design. The [propsed new flow](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/p/AE225764-D5BB-4CE6-9577-38E8F570392B/canvas) and designs include rearranging the order of the questions, updating the content to plain language standards and design pattern updates around multiple responses (list and loop) used when adding dependents.

### OCTO Objectives 
**Increase**
- Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)
- Completion rate of online transactions

**Decrease**
- Time to successful complete and submit online transactions
- Time to process online applications (vs. paper)


### Veteran Journey
The Health Care Application fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) at the following stages:
- Getting out
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself

## Research Goals	
**1. Optimize the order and flow of questions within the household information section**

**2. Determine if the questions and contextual information is clear and actionable**

**3. Establish a qualitative baseline to aid in measuring the usability impacts of changes made**


### Outcome
The outcome of this research will help guide what changes should be made to the household information to make it easier for Veterans/applicants to complete this section without leaving the application. 


### Research questions
- Within the household information section (step 4) of the 10-10EZ health care application, do the questions occur in an order that is logical to Veterans/applicants?
- What is easy or difficult and why for the Veteran/applicant as they work through the household information questions?

- Are the questions worded and explained in a way that is clear and understandable to the Veterans/applicants or is additional context and explanation needed?
- What struggles do participants encounter with the process of adding and editing multiple dependents?
- How do the proposed design and content changes compare to the existing pages in the opinion of the Veteran/applicant?


### Hypothesis
- The new pattern to add and edit dependents has less cognitive load for the applicant and takes less time to complete.
- The content explaining the various financial areas (gross income, net and other) is easy to digest now that it is broken up into sections and placed in relation to the corresponding text field. 
- The financial information question is well received and the onboarding page provides the Veteran/applicant with the information they need to proceed easily through this section of the applicaiton.
- In comparision to the existing pages, participants will prefer the new designs with content changes.



## Methods

### Task Analysis
Moderated usability testing for task analysis will be on a desktop prototype (conducted in staging

We will test both flows - new and existing - via 2 cohorts and using desktop prototypes. We will capture qualitative comments and task usability ratings to a/b test. 


### Location
Remote: Zoom

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We will recruit Veterans for this research using and leveraging Perigean to recruit participants. 
We will request partipants with critera that were not covered in the studies conduced on 10-10EZ in the past year ([10-10EZ short form usability](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/Short%20form%20usability-June%202022/research-findings.md#who-this-study-excludes)).



### Recruitment criteria
|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.

### Screener

- Do you have children (biological or adopted)? [answer should be yes to qualify]
- Do you have children (biological or adopted)? [answer should be yes to qualify]


## Timeline
> Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

October - November 2022 

### Prepare
> When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

> A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: TBD


### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 2


### Availability

Team Availability | Time (ET)

> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
