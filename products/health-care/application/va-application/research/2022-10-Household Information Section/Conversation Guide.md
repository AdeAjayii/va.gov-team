## Moderator logistics

Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).


### Starting the session
- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*


## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jessica and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple additional observers during this session?

- If participant does not consent, use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
- If participant consents, admit observers. 
   - Ask notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

**Today we're going to talk about the Health Care Applcation but specifically are looking to get your feedback on the section of the form that asks about household information such as your spouse, dependents and financial information.**

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Do you frequently use VA.gov and regulary sign in to your account? How often would you 
- Have you applied for health care recently and if so did you use the online form? (screener questions?)
- Do you have multiple dependents (screen question?) and if so, is there an application experience, good or bad, that stands out in your mind you can tell us more about?

## Setup - 5 minutes

For the context of this session, you are applying for health care using the online apllication found on VA.gov.

I'm going to ask you to open a prototype from a link I'll post in the chat and have you share your screen. Just a reminder - it'll be very helpful if you think out loud and share what's on your mind as much as possible as you're looking at the prototype.

- [Send link to prototype in Zoom chat]
- [If user is on mobile, tell them to tap the three dots that say "More" and then select Chat from the menu to access the link that was sent]
- [Ask participant to share their screen by selecting the green Share Screen button in the middle of the bottom menu]
