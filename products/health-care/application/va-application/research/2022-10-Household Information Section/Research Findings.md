## Research Goals

### Background

The household information section, step 4 out of 6 in the application progress flow, has been identified as a pain point through [past research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/Household%20info%20design%20discovery.pdf) and [page analtyics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/research/april-may-2021/end-user-discovery/10-10EZ%20Discovery%20Research%20readout.pdf) indicating it is the area of the form with a high drop-off rate. Initial discovery of this problem space began with an [UX audit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/Household%20section%20redesign/Research/Household-UX-Audit.md) that included looking at usability best practices and competitive research lens, prior to starting design. The [propsed new flow](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/p/AE225764-D5BB-4CE6-9577-38E8F570392B/canvas) and designs include rearranging the order of the questions, updating the content to plain language standards and design pattern updates around multiple responses (list and loop) used when adding dependents

The Health Care Application fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) at the following stages:
- Getting out
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself

### Goals

**1. Determine if the questions and additional information within the household information section is clear and actionable.**

**2. Determine if the financial onboarding page content is helpful and understandable.**  

**3. Optimize the order and flow of questions within the household information section.**

These research goals support key results from the [initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/Household%20section%20redesign/ReadMe.md#key-result-3-veterans-feel-prepared-when-they-begin-the-household-section):
- Key Result #3: Veterans feel prepared when they begin the Household section
- Key Result #4: Veterans understand what is being asked of them and why, feeling comfortable in providing the information.

## Research Questions

**Goal 1 - Clear and actionable**
- Are the questions worded and explained in a way that is clear and understandable to the Veterans/applicants or is additional context and explanation needed?
- What is easy or difficult and why for the Veteran/applicant as they work through the household information questions?

**Goal 2 - Helpful and understandable content** 
- Is there information missing that could help the Veteran/applicant complete the annual income and deductible information questions?
- Does the Veteran/applicant seem to struggle or indicate they have to pause and return to the application to get income information?

**Goal 3 - Logical order**
- Within the household information section (step 4) of the 10-10EZ health care application, do the questions occur in an order that is logical to Veterans/applicants?
- What struggles do participants encounter with the process of adding and editing multiple dependents?
- Is there clear error recovery and easy editing ability when adding multiple entries for a question?

## Methodology 

A moderated usability study using an interactive prototype of the 10-10EZ Healthcare application. The study included separate versions of the prototype for desktop and mobile users.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

1) The financial information question is well received and the onboarding page provides the Veteran/applicant with the information they need to proceed easily through this section of the applicaiton.
   - **Conclusion 1: Maybe true**
   - Most participants rated the introduction page favorably (giving it 4 or 5 out of 5 rating) in that it prepared them for the application, however some mentioned that they needed more context and help to be able to provide this information and some also mentioned not wanting to provide it at all, but having to.

2) The content explaining the various financial areas (gross income, net and other) is easy to digest now that it is broken up into sections and placed in relation to the corresponding text field.
   - **Conclusion 2: Maybe true**
   - 	Some participants said the questions on the page about annual income were clear and easy to understand, but most gave an example of where extra explanation could be really helpful when answering these questions. 

3) The updates to the multiple responses pattern to add and edit dependents has less cognitive load for the applicant and is easy for them to complete.
   - **Conclusion 3: Not enough information**
   - 	Most participants were successful with the task to add dependents to the form easily. This study used a prototype with limited functionality there was not enough information to determine if editing dependents information had less cognitive load. Most participants did mention it would be easier to review the dependent information when they were editing or a way to view all pages of information at once during editing.

## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

### Key Finding 1: Additional explanation needed
There were a some areas of the application where participants mentioned examples **where more information would be helpful for them to understand** what they were being asked.

- 6/10 interacted with or had questions on eligibility guidelines on the financial disclosure page (Disclosure Task)
- 7/10 participants mentioned the dependent question could use more clarification (Add Dependents Task)
- 5/10 interacted with who does VA consider a dependent or had questions on this topic (Add Dependents Task)
- 7/10 participants said extra explanation could be helpful for what counts as income, business income and how gross and net are combined (Income Task)
- 4/10 non-reimbursable medical expenses explanation is needed (Deductibles Task)


### Key Finding 2: Document and information gathering 
Most participants mentioned the process of gathering documents, one example the DD214, and/or adding numbers correctly to complete the annual and deductibles section and that this process could be a **potential reason to pause the application or for it to take extra time**.


- 7/10 participants mentioned the process of gathering documents, specifically the DD214, and the time and steps that would take them  (Start Application Task)
- To upload a document on the military service page, 3/10 participants said they would scan the document with a printer to upload and 4/10 said they would take a picture with their device to upload to the application. (VA benefits/Military service - upload task)
- One participant mentioned this should be automated as this information should be available already. (VA benefits/Military service - upload Task)
- 2/10 participants reported they would need to pause for the income information and need help from their wife to complete. (Annual income Task)
- 4/10 participants felt the deductible information would take a half hour or more to gather as it was asking a lot for a health care application (Deductibles Task)


### Key Finding 3: Multiple responses and editing information 
Most participants thought **adding a dependent was clear overall with nothing they would change or add**, overall participants were successful to complete adding dependents. 
And most participants also mentioned **it would be easier if they could review all their dependent’s information at once when editing** instead of having to go through a series of screens again.

- 8/10 participants could successfully edit and remove a dependent from the application
- 6/10 said adding a dependent was overall clear and there is nothing they would change

- 2/10 participants attempted to use the browser back button or missed the edit link initially


### Key Finding 4: Spouse information and live with/address questions

There were a some areas of the application where participants mentioned examples **where more information would be helpful for them to understand** what they were being asked.


> I guess this could be more clear, Like my initial look at it I thought veteran pension but is that disability or pension. I am not sure. It could be more specific. [P6-014] (VA Benefits / Military Service Task)

> Um, I guess maybe for these two put links to what they are (travel and copay) I wouldn’t know what they are or what I would need for those. The rest seems fine. [P6-019] (Financial Onboarding Task)

> Where it says 'the financial information you will need', when it's asking for last year's gross income, before taxes and any other deductions - you could 'i.e. pay stub' something like that so service members know what they can use. Just to get their mind thinking 'oh ok I can use this' - something like that. [P13-019] (Financial Onboarding Task)

> No. I assume this is for a dependent over the age of 18. I was asking for expenses because under 18 there are always expenses. I guess this is fine. I guess this is fine, I am just trying to read through the jargon is all
