# [DRAFT] Research Plan for 10-10 Team, Health Care Application (10-10EZ), Baseline Tasks, November 2022

## Background
The Health Care Application (10-10EZ) enables Veterans to access and apply for VA Health care easily with any device at any time, with or without assistance. Veterans can do this either as an unauthenticated user or as an authenticated user. This is an existing product and this research study will focusing on getting an overall baseline on usability of key tasks. 

- Product | [10-10EZ Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/10-10EZ%20Health%20Care%20Application%20-%20Product%20Outline.md)


### OCTO Objectives 

The [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) this research supports are:

**Increase**
- Usage of digital, self- service tools
- Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)

**Decrease**
- Time to successful complete and submit online transactions



### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 


## Research Goals	
1. Test the main tasks within the application to get a qualitative baseline. 
2. Overall, what is easy or difficult and why related to the form.
3. Are there any areas that cause confusion that need further exploration.


### Outcome

We will use the results from this research to esablish some baseline to compare against in future research studies specific to these key repeatable tasks. 

### Research questions


- What tasks are consistently completed by participants with ease?
- What tasks do the majority of participants struggle with or have some level of difficulty?
- What tasks have a range of participant reactions



### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so donâ€™t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Method	
- Usability testing task analysis- appropriate for evaluative research


### Location
Remote: Zoom

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
> Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

> Pro tip:
> - For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
> - Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
> - Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

> Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment approach
We will recruit Veterans for this research using and leveraging Perigean to recruit participants. 




### Recruitment criteria
|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
|               |                  |        |             |          |              | 


**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
> Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 



### Prepare
We will be testing what is currently approved in staging.

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 

* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: 

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
* Maximum Sessions per day: 3

### Availability
Team Availability | Time (ET)
------------------|--------------
TBD         | TBD
TBD         | TBD
TBD         | TBD


_Only use if necessary_ | Time (ET)
------------------|--------------
TBD         | TBD
TBD         | TBD


> Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
