# DRAFT Research Plan for health care application generative research study around Priority Groups and Financial Disclosure [Health Enrollment Team, 10-10EZ, June 2023]

## Background
The online health care application (10-10EZ) and the update form (10-10EZR which is only paper form today) both can impact a Veteran's eligibilty and placement when applying for and managing their health care benefits. This is more so impactful for those placed in a Priority Group who need to have income information considered for copays and travel reimbrusment in addition to eligibility. The 10-10EZ is the initial application that then places a Veteran in a Priority Group for enrollment into the full medical benefits package. The 10-10EZR is used to proivde personal, financial or insurance information updates after enrollment. 

The outcome of this generative research study will help in understanding the Veteran's mental model around health care benefits - as it pertains to getting, understanding and maintaining those benefits - to gain a broad, holistic view and iterate on various hypotheses as the team works towards designing an MVP.

### OCTO Priorities 

Which [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience


### Veteran Journey

- This fits accross the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from **getting out to aging**.

- This impacts a **key moment that matters** in that Veterans need to select the health care coverage according to their individual needs and preferences and that is the best fit for them. 


## Research Goals	




Learn more about Veteran's mental model when applying for health care benefits including the terms they use and how they see levels of benefits/Priority Groups/copays impacting them during the health care application process, during and ongoing after.

Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about applying, discovering eligibility and getting the most health care benefits they qualify for and what amount of information they feel they need to provide in that process vs. what the VA should have already. 

Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about providing updated information, especially financial and dependent updates, that could impact their health care benefits post-application/initial enrollment.


### Outcome
We will use these findings to:
- Check assumptions and terminology used to remain Veteran-centric
- Develop insights into an ideal state and how Veteran would prefer to navigate the health care benefits application journey
- Develop insights into how a Veteran would like to find personalized information about Priority Groups and copays online
- Develop insights into where and how a Veteran would expect to be able to update their financial information online
- Get initial feedback on early wireframes and hypothetical scenario storyboards

  

### Research questions


Learn more about Veteran's mental model when applying for health care benefits including the terms they use and how they see levels of benefits/Priority Groups/copays impacting them during the health care application process, during and ongoing after.
- What are the Veteran's current pain points with how the health care application impacts the overall health care journey?
- What is the order and process expectations of Veterans when they are applying for health care benefits in regards to revealing Priority Groups and copay levels?
- Do Veterans seem confused by Priority Group transparency?
- Is there frustration about steps or processes after the initial application process in regards to providing more information, filling out additional forms?


Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about applying, discovering eligibility and getting the most health care benefits they qualify for and what amount of information they feel they need to provide in that process vs. what the VA should have already. 
- What is the Veteran's mental model of discovering, getting and keeping health care benefits as they go through the application process?
- What is the Veterans perception of eligibility and Priority Groups around their health care benefits?
- What information do Veterans feel most that the VA has and they should not have to provide?



Learn more about how Veterans would like to go about providing updated information, especially financial and dependent updates, that could impact their health care benefits post-application/initial enrollment.
- Do Veterans call out the VA profile or MyHelatheVet or the mobile app or (enter here) as their ideal way to provide this updated information in an online setting?
- Do Veterans prefer to provide updated information in person at appointments or over the phone?
- Would Veterans prefer to be prompted to provide updated financials?




### Hypothesis
- We assume the overall process of determining eligibility and being placed in a Priority Group is somewhat unclear to Veterans today.
- We assume not all Veterans go through the enrollment process in one go, there is often stops, such as an exam and other claims filed in between that could impact their enrollment and Priority Group placement. 
- We assume that Veterans who have health care regularly login to VA.gov / Profile 
- We assume that the VA.gov Profile would be a place that Veterans would natuarlly think to look for financial update information.


## Methodology

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

Our intended audience for this reasearch are Veterans and we will be using and leveraging Perigean to recruit participants.

### Recruitment criteria

10 completed sessions / **15 requested**


**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

**Screener Questions**

- Have you applied for health care benefits within the past 5 years and are now enrolled and using these benefits? [answer should be yes to qualify.]



**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 


- At least 4 participants are female
- At least 4 participants with a cognitive disability
- At least 4 participants over the age of 55
- At least 3 participants who are living abroad or immigrant origin


## Timeline

Thursday, July 13 -  Thursday, July 19




### Prepare
* Pilot participant email: 
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:


### Length of sessions
* Session length:  < 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
* Maximum Sessions per day: 4

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
