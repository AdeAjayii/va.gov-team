## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about the health care application experience but mostly focusing on what happens after around benefits and updates.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 


## Warm-up Questions  - 3 minutes

Letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you currently enrolled and using health care benefits from the VA? 
- How often do you visit a VA facility for medical care? 
- How often do you visit VA.gov online? And do you sign in every time or how often do you sign in?


## First Topic: [Current Process] - 10 minutes

- Can you explain to me in your own words the process when you applied for health care benefits?
- [If they don't specify] Did you complete this online, in-person or via paper application by yourself?
- Was it clear to you as you were applying, what benefits you would qualify for?
- What resources did you use to understand what you might qualify for during this process?
- How would you describe the process that happened after you applied, such as things you had to do, additional information you had to provide, communications from the VA, your first appointment, etc.?


### Things to watch for:
- [What terminology does the Veteran use as they talk about their experience?]
- [How does the Veteran portray the overall process - easy, difficult, uneventful?]
- [What pain points or areas of confusion are revealed?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group] - 5 minutes

- Do you know what Priority Group you are in for your health care benefits now?
- Can you please describe how this was communicated to you and how you understood the impact to you and what health care you could get?
- Before you completed enrollment, were you aware of Priority Groups or copays as part of the health care benefits package?

### Things to watch for:
- [How does the Veteran descirbe the process of figuring out what they are eligble for - are they frustrated, do they find it easy, do they just expect the VA to have the data and figure it out for them?]
- [Is there any confusion about their benefits within the health care benefits they recieve?]
- [Do they know confidently know their Priority Group and what that means to them and their benefits?]


## Second Topic: [Priority Group - SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- I'm going to share my screen and show you a couple of hypothetical options on how you might be able to view your health care benefits online after enrollment.

- Mural board


- What kind of benefit would being able to view your Priority Group online provide you?
- Out of these two options, is there one that would be more useful to you?
- Is there anything here you would consider noise and not want to see on these examples?
- Can you talk me through where you would expect to find this information on VA.gov so today?


## Third Topic: [Financial Disclosure- SCENARIO] - 10 minutes

- Now I would like to transition to you sharing your screen and have to go to the link in the chat:
- https://staging.va.gov/
- For this next scenario, you completed that application and enrolled for health care benefits.
- You get a bill in the mail saying you owe for copays and you need to submit your financial information from the last calendar year to keep that benefit.
- Now from the link sent to you, walk me through where you would expect to be able to provide your updated income information so you can go back to qualifing for no copays as you used to.
- You can stop screen sharing now, thank you.


## Third Topic: [Financial Disclosure] - 10 minutes

- Have you had to provide updated information since you have been enrolled, like changes in income or adding dependents?
- If so, can you tell me more about how this process went for you?
- How would you like to go about providing various updates that could impact your health care benefits?
- How would you see a change in income impacting your health care benefits?
- If you have copays, when during the enrollment process were you clear on what you qualified for and what you would have to pay? 
- In a perfect world, how would you like to discover what copays you qualify to pay?


## Fourth Topic: [Ideal State] - 5 minutes
- Could you describe how - in a perfect world - you would **want** the health care application process to go for you? From learning what you qualify for, applying and using and updating your information to keep your benefits. 
- What tools, communication, people could make this the best process possible in your mind?
- What information would be important to you so you feel confident when having to apply for and use your health care benefits?


### Things to watch for:
- [Are there any terminology used that stand out as the Veteran is describing their ideal process?]
- [What steps do they call out?]
- [What steps do they leave out?]
- [What do they mention or call out as information that is helpful in making decisions about health care benefits?]





## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes

- Is there anything else you would like to add about what we talked about today?
- Any questions for me? 


## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
