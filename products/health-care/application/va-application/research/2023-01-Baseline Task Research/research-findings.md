## Research Goals
The Health Care Application (10-10EZ) enables Veterans to access and apply for VA health care easily with any device at any time, with or without assistance. Veterans can do this either as an unauthenticated user or as an authenticated user. This is an existing product and this research study will focusing on getting an overall baseline understanding of usability for key tasks. We will be focusing on the unauthenticated path using the staging environment for testing.

The health care application product fits into the Veteran journey during the phases:

Taking care of myself
Starting up
Retiring
Attending to health care needs during the starting up phase of the journey is a defined moment that matters, as is taking care of my health during the retiring phase.

**Research Goals**
1. Obtain a qualitative baseline for tasks within the application to use in comparrison with future studies and iterations.
2. Overall, what is easy or difficult to complete within the form and why.
3. Uncover pain point areas that cause confusion and need further discovery and research.



_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-goals)_



## Research Questions
* What tasks are consistently completed by participants with ease?
* What tasks do the majority of participants struggle with or have some level of difficulty?
* How successufl are participants in completing the household information section questions?



_[See an example ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-questions)_


## Methodology 

_Brief description of method chosen_
**Usability testing Post-task and post-testing participant questions


_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#methodology)_


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypotheses or tasks for this research along with the conclusions you found If you conducted a usability test, list the success or task completion rate._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)_

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_



The baseline study will help establish that the insights and pain points from previous studies are still consistently an issue with participants in this study.

**"Not enough information"**

[Wireflow showing previous research insights in application flow]()


The baseline study will show that there are areas of the form that most participants complete tasks easily (entering personal information or when going through short form flow) or areas that they consistently struggle (household information and insurance).

**"Maybe True"**


The baseline study will show that the current household information section is a pain point due to the order of the questions and the content supplying additional context.

**"Not enough information"**



## Key Findings

1. There were unfavorable perception towards providing certain information, specifically reporting income and insurance information.

2. The review pattern at the end of the application is easy-to-use to check answers and make changes prior to submitting.

3. Stopping points for information gathering occured frequently around discharge papers (DD-214) and income or deductible information. 

4. There was confusion and missing information around the VA Benefits and Military Service questions.

5. Who qualifyies as a dependent, that definition and general question confusion existed for participants who answered yes to having dependents.

**Unfavorable perception towards providing certain information, especially reporting income and insurance details**

Brief description


> No, I would not want to provide financial information for any reason. You get your check from the government, so they know how much you get anyways. (P4-15)

>  I think the VA should be for Veterans who can not afford insurance. Now disability is different then using the VA because if that is something you are entitled to you are entitled to it. Me, personally, am in a good financial situation so I would not provide that information because I want these funds to be used for those who are not.
(P9-11)
