## Research Goals
The Health Care Application (10-10EZ) enables Veterans to access and apply for VA health care easily with any device at any time, with or without assistance. Veterans can do this either as an unauthenticated user or as an authenticated user. 

Product | 10-10EZ Product Outline


The purpose of this study was to: 

1. Obtain a qualitative baseline for tasks within the application to use in comparrison with past studies and future iterations.
2. Overall, what is easy or difficult to complete within the form and why.
3. Uncover pain point areas that cause confusion and need further discovery and research.



## Research Questions
* What tasks are consistently completed by participants with ease?
* What tasks do the majority of participants struggle with or have some level of difficulty?
* How successufl are participants in completing the household information section questions?


## Methodology 

We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on **January 27 - Feburary 10, 2023**. We had participants go through the entire application/form in the staging environment as they would if they were completing as they would.

**Usability testing**
**Post-task and post-testing participant questions**


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypotheses or tasks for this research along with the conclusions you found If you conducted a usability test, list the success or task completion rate._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)_

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_



The baseline study will help establish that the insights and pain points from previous studies are still consistently an issue with participants in this study.

**"Not enough information"**

- [Wireflow showing previous research insights in application flow](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/a/dlJob5E)
- 


The baseline study will show that there are areas of the form that most participants complete tasks easily (entering personal information) or areas that they consistently struggle (household information and insurance).

**"Maybe True"**
- The participants generally had took more effort to answer questions in the household information section around income and the insurance questions, however participants were also confused in the VA benefits or military service sections as well.


The baseline study will show that the current household information section is a pain point due to the order of the questions and the content supplying additional context.

**"Not enough information"**
- We did not have many participants who went through all of the household information flow elements including spouse and multiple dependents. 
- More participants in this study suggested they would not want to provide this information or it should be collected by other means.



## Key Findings

1. There were unfavorable perception towards providing certain information, specifically reporting income and insurance information.

2. The review pattern at the end of the application is easy-to-use to check answers and make changes prior to submitting.

3. Stopping points for information gathering occured frequently around discharge papers (DD-214) and income or deductible information. 

4. There was confusion and missing information around the VA Benefits and Military Service questions.

5. Who qualifyies as a dependent, that definition and general question confusion existed for participants who answered yes to having dependents.

### Finding 1
**There were unfavorable perception towards providing certain information, specifically reporting income and insurance information.**

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare] [TREND: Content]

4/9 of the participants indicated they did not want to provide their financial information or insurance or they answered no on the financial disclosure page.

*Income*
> No, I would not want to provide financial information for any reason. You get your check from the government, so they know how much you get anyways. (P4-15)

>  I think the VA should be for Veterans who can not afford insurance. Now disability is different then using the VA because if that is something you are entitled to you are entitled to it. Me, personally, am in a good financial situation so I would not provide that information because I want these funds to be used for those who are not. (P9-11)

> If you didn’t have your paperwork, but the IRS has it anyways, so they have it anyways. It tells you they will verify with the IRS anyways. So, in this case you don’t have to do it anyways. (P11-14)

> I just read this section here, they are saying this information is used to see what benefits are given. I make pretty good money, so I am now annoyed by that. I would probably not continue at this time because I would have to gather the information. Some of this stuff I would need to find a copy because someone them I do not have a copy. (P2-3)

Some participants noted the mention of IRS or verifying with and assumed they would have to upload or connect to their tax return or that this should be verifyied automatically and they should not have to provide on the application. 

> If I were to upload my tax information would this auto populate? If it was there I would appreciate it because I already went through the trouble of uploading it so it would be nice if it did it. (P12-19)
> Yes, do we just have to download taxes? (goes back to first paragraph to read through)(P14-21)
> This just gets my goat. IRS is not nice word. (P2-20)

*Insurance*
> I don’t see it why putting the little bit of health insurance I get from my employer. Those two things should not meet. My other insurance should not be charged for anything. (P4-18)
> I will never agree with the insurance question, but that may just be me. They want to connect so they can charge my healthcare insurance for something they will not cover themselves. Is it fair they can tax onto my other insurance. (P4-37)

### Finding 2

**The review pattern at the end of the application is easy-to-use to check answers and make changes prior to submitting.**

Brief description

> [P1-34] It is easy to use. If you have two brain cells you can fill it out. I really like that you can edit instead of going back through to correct something. 

> [P2-31] Makes me feel very confident…I love that it’s in sections…I’m very confident that I would use this, I think it’s great.

> [P7-30] It is very good I like it...It is letting me look at all my information I put in and there is also an edit button if I need to change anything.

> [P12-24] Because it makes everything else [easy] to verify all my information, edit information right here on the spot, you do not have to go through the whole application again to make any changes. It is all on one page.
