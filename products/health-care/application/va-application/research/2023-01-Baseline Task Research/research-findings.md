## Research Goals
The Health Care Application (10-10EZ) enables Veterans to access and apply for VA health care easily with any device at any time, with or without assistance. Veterans can do this either as an unauthenticated user or as an authenticated user. This is an existing product and this research study will focusing on getting an overall baseline understanding of usability for key tasks. We will be focusing on the unauthenticated path using the staging environment for testing.

The health care application product fits into the Veteran journey during the phases:

Taking care of myself
Starting up
Retiring
Attending to health care needs during the starting up phase of the journey is a defined moment that matters, as is taking care of my health during the retiring phase.

**Research Goals**
1. Obtain a qualitative baseline for tasks within the application to use in comparrison with future studies and iterations.
2. Overall, what is easy or difficult to complete within the form and why.
3. Uncover pain point areas that cause confusion and need further discovery and research.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypotheses or tasks for this research along with the conclusions you found If you conducted a usability test, list the success or task completion rate._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)_

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_



The baseline study will help establish that the insights and pain points from previous studies are still consistently an issue with participants in this study.

The baseline study will show that there are areas of the form that most participants complete tasks easily (entering personal information or when going through short form flow) or areas that they consistently struggle (household information and insurance).

The baseline study will show that the current household information section is a pain point due to the order of the questions and the content supplying additional context.


## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

1. Unfavorable perception towards providing certain information - reporting income and insurance information

2. Finding two

3. Finding three

4. Finding four

5. Finding five

6. Finding six

7. Finding seven
