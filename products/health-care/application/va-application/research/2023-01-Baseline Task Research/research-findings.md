## Research Goals
The Health Care Application (10-10EZ) enables Veterans to access and apply for VA health care easily with any device at any time, with or without assistance. Veterans can do this either as an unauthenticated user or as an authenticated user. 

- Product | [10-10EZ Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/10-10EZ%20Health%20Care%20Application%20-%20Product%20Outline.md)

The purpose of this study was to: 

1. Obtain a qualitative baseline for tasks within the application to use in comparrison with past studies and future iterations.
2. Overall, what is easy or difficult to complete within the form and why.
3. Uncover pain point areas that cause confusion and need further discovery and research.



## Research Questions
* What tasks are consistently completed by participants with ease?
* What tasks do the majority of participants struggle with or have some level of difficulty?
* How successufl are participants in completing the household information section questions?


## Methodology 

We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on **January 27 - Feburary 10, 2023**. We had participants go through the entire application/form in the staging environment as they would if they were completing as they would.

- **Usability testing**
- **Post-task and post-testing participant questions**



## Hypotheses and Conclusions

### Hypotheses 1
The baseline study will help establish that the insights and pain points from previous studies are still consistently an issue with participants in this study.

**"Not enough information"**

- [Wireflow showing previous research insights in application flow](https://www.sketch.com/s/da85cf44-4503-4e98-834e-ff068b242ef6/a/dlJob5E)
- 

### Hypotheses 2
The baseline study will show that there are areas of the form that most participants complete tasks easily (entering personal information) or areas that they consistently struggle (household information and insurance).

**"Maybe True"**

- The participants generally had took more effort to answer questions in the household information section around income and the insurance questions, however participants were also confused in the VA benefits or military service sections as well.

### Hypotheses 3
The baseline study will show that the current household information section is a pain point due to the order of the questions and the content supplying additional context.

**"Not enough information"**

- We did not have many participants who went through all of the household information flow elements including spouse and multiple dependents. 
- More participants in this study suggested they would not want to provide this information or it should be collected by other means.



## Key Findings

1. There were unfavorable perception towards providing certain information, specifically reporting income and insurance information.

2. The review pattern at the end of the application is easy-to-use to check answers and make changes prior to submitting.

3. Stopping points for information gathering occurred frequently around discharge papers (DD-214) and income or deductible information. 

4. There was confusion and missing information around the VA Benefits and Military Service questions.

5. Who qualifies as a dependent, that definition and general question confusion existed for participants who answered yes to having dependents. 




## Details of Findings 


### Finding 1
**Participants expressed unfavorable perceptions towards providing certain information, specifically reporting income and insurance information.**

Labels: [AUD: Veterans], [BNFT: Healthcare], [TREND: Content]

4/9 of the participants indicated they did not want to provide their financial information or insurance or they answered no on the financial disclosure page.

*Income*
> No, I would not want to provide financial information for any reason. You get your check from the government, so they know how much you get anyways. (P4-15)

>  I think the VA should be for Veterans who can not afford insurance. Now disability is different then using the VA because if that is something you are entitled to you are entitled to it. Me, personally, am in a good financial situation so I would not provide that information because I want these funds to be used for those who are not. (P9-11)

> If you didn’t have your paperwork, but the IRS has it anyways, so they have it anyways. It tells you they will verify with the IRS anyways. So, in this case you don’t have to do it anyways. (P11-14)

> I just read this section here, they are saying this information is used to see what benefits are given. I make pretty good money, so I am now annoyed by that. I would probably not continue at this time because I would have to gather the information. Some of this stuff I would need to find a copy because someone them I do not have a copy. (P2-3)


Some participants noted the mention of IRS or verifying with and assumed they would have to upload or connect to their tax return or that this should be verifyied automatically and they should not have to provide on the application. 

> If I were to upload my tax information would this auto populate? If it was there I would appreciate it because I already went through the trouble of uploading it so it would be nice if it did it. (P12-19)

> Yes, do we just have to download taxes? (goes back to first paragraph to read through)(P14-21)

> This just gets my goat. IRS is not nice word. (P2-20)


*Insurance*
> I don’t see it why putting the little bit of health insurance I get from my employer. Those two things should not meet. My other insurance should not be charged for anything. (P4-18)

> I will never agree with the insurance question, but that may just be me. They want to connect so they can charge my healthcare insurance for something they will not cover themselves. Is it fair they can tax onto my other insurance. (P4-37)


### Finding 2

**The review pattern at the end of the application is easy-to-use to check answers and make changes prior to submitting.**

Labels: [DSP: Form feedback], [DSC: Accordions]

Overall participants reacted favorably on the review page and were able to intuitively open, review and change their information as needed. 
There was one sugestion of being able to also upload their DD-214 on the review page.

- 8/10 participants were able to successfuly comment on how to edit and make updates on the review page.
- 8/10 participants rated the review page 5/5 and the other 2 participants did not provide a rating at all, but provided positive comments. 


> It is great. It has all the information here for you, and if you need to fix a mistake it has the edit button here that you do not have to go back. (P9-15)

> Well, it says edits, so I would go ahead and edit it like that. Then I would update page and it changes it. (P7-29)

> 5, it is easy to use. If you have two brain cells you can fill it out. I really like that you can edit instead of going back through to correct something. (P1-34)

*Potential Pain Points*
> It brought over all the information from earlier. There is an edit button if you want to change anything. I don’t see an option to upload or change the document on this page. You should add that on this page. (P11-28)

> Say if I needed to go back to the financial part to verify I may not, but I would be worried because there is nothing here that says it would save my progress. (P12-25)


### Finding 3

**Stopping/pausing points for information gathering occured frequently around discharge papers (DD-214) and income or deductible information.**

Labels: label 1, [DSP: Files] 

Brief description

> So far everything is pretty simple. I am assuming based on this statement that I have already applied to disability and have received a rating. If I tried to enroll in this without a rating. I want to go back and get into that.

*Upload file task / DD-214*
> It could take anywhere from 5 minutes or 5 days. I could have it in a safe or maybe I have a scanned copy somewhere in my email. If it were in my email 10 minutes, if I didn’t receive it yet it could take months. (P12-14) 

> I would have to contact the VA in St. Louis and request a copy of my DD-214. (P9-9) 

> Young veterans would be fine with this but idk you still have old veterans. They are eligible to use VA benefits but they don’t know what they qualify for or how to find it….my husband runs into a veteran who doesn’t re…these older people might not know how to do the technical part. (P14-18)



*Income and deductibles*
> It seems cut and dry. It does throws me off if this is worker’s comp. Now I have to round up more information on stocks, so it would make me want to go back and click on that I do not want to provide this information. (P2-21)

> Depending on sites if they have the information available. Maybe 20 minutes. (P13-12)

> This is enough information to get me started. The only thing I would need to look at is this gross household income because that would be through my husband. (P14-6)

> I would need clarity on this one because are they just talking college? I sometimes attend different events to future my education for my career. I attend other things that I would considered educational. I am taking an educational course on Google Sheets, so would that count? (P2-25)




### Finding 4

**There was confusion and missing information around the VA Benefits and Military Service questions.**
Labels: label 1, [TREND: Content] 

Brief description
- 7/9 (excluding short form participant) mentioned some item of confusion or noted that they thought something was missing when they completed the questions in these two setions. 

*VA Benefits*
> There is just a lot of unnecessary information on here. I don’t know the difference between the compensation/pension. If they could just do a dropdown box, or even have a definition somewhere on the page telling us what the difference is. (P12-11)

*Military Service*
> Question on this one, should I just use my first retirement date? I went back on a recall after my first retirement date. You never know which date they want you to use. (P4-12)

> I'm confused because it tells me that I need to click all that apply, but none of those apply to me. I just want something that states 'none apply to me'. (P2-17)


*Missing information*
> At some point they will put in something about the burn pits too and stuff like that, the burn pits were awful for people. (P7-17) 

> I don’t see anything in regard to the burn pits. I would add that in there definitely. (P9-7)

> Right here it says up to 40% and above 50%, is there nothing between that? (P11-10)


 
### Finding 5

**There was some confusion around dependents - who qualifies and how some questions were understood.**
Labels: label 1, label 2 


Brief description
- 5 participants mentioned there was confusion or missing information around the dependent question. 


> That is just an odd question. I feel there should be a N/A option because that is stating that you do have a dependent between that age frame. If you click no or N/A you should not have to fill in a dollar amount. (P11-17)

> I grew up thinking a dependent is a kid, but my ex-wife is a dependent by military standards. (P1-24)

> Old military dependent. I have a 19-year-old so she is over the age of dependent but she can be on Tricare until she is 25. Now they say family member they don’t say dependent. It made me pause because I was used to being a dependent for so long. (P14-22)

> I am curious, you should have a checkbox that says they became your dependent on the same day as birth. I do understand why that is there in case you adopted or have a stepchild. (P12-17)



## Additional Insights

**1. Most participants indicated they would sign in or create an account prior to completing the application**

> I have ID.me so I would use that to start the application. I have signed into the site, but not recently. (P9-2)

> It said at the bottom to sign in to start the application so I would click that to start my application. I am assuming that it is connected to all the normal logins so I could use the normal sign ins.(P4-4)

**2. Introduction page made participants feel prepared but some had additional suggestions:**

> I would recommend that this section right here, you may enroll in healthcare if this is true. I would say to move this to the top and bolding the entire the whole statement or it may be glossed over like I did. If that is separated you it would be more clear that you just have to meet one of the requirements rather then all of them. (P1-4)

> I would want to see how this would work with my private health insurance on this page. (P2-5)
  
**3. Particpants called out birth sex question and expectation of gender identity options**

> no, not me, somebody might have a problem with there only being two genders. i am used to seeing the other option. (P12-6)

> Unless there were two questions where one says what you were assigned as birth and then another that says what do you identify as because if someone is applying for mental health issues and that had anything to do with it, they would need to know.
(P14-10)

>  This bothers me because I am transgender so I would like more options than just male or female. I would hope later they would ask our pronouns instead of what our gender at birth is.(P1-15)


**4. Progress bar**

> I am still thrown off by step 1 of 6. I have gone through all this and I am still on step 1. I would think as I am clicking continue I would go through steps as I clicked. Maybe add an estimated time on how long it would take to fill out the form. Maybe label it step 1a, 1b…..(P2-13)
