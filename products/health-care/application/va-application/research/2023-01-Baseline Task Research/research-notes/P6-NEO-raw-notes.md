### Start application
-	[Reads over information] 5/5 rating; “Because it’s self-explanatory…it’s dummy proof.”

### Pre-check
-	Inputs middle name, states that it might help verify more thuroughly

### Veteran information
-	[Anything clear/unclear] “Everything is fine so far.”
-	Includes mother’s maiden name
-	[Native American question] “Self explanatory”
-	Includes email address

### VA benefits
-	50% or higher – shortened form!; stated that form seemed clear and self-explanatory

### Military service
- [none]

### Household information
- [none]

### Insurance information
-	Stated that is clear and self-explanatory
-	Does have health insurance coverage; goes through fields and enters info/policy number
-	States she picks facilities base on which one is closest; would look up that information before starting the application (or at least knew it beforehand)

### Review
-	[Edit info] clicks edit in the field that she would need to change; stated it’s clear how to remove something – “Unless It doesn’t have an asterisk – that means it’s important”
-	Feels confident it’s going to get submitted correctly; no reason at this point to not submit application
-	[Confirm page] “Everything is clear”; expects to receive a confirmation in the mail that VA has confirmed their enrollment
-	10/10 would recommend – “Faster, quicker to verify, and eliminates paper trails for the Veteran in need of service”
-	Same rating as initial onboarding page
-	No unnecessary questions; seemed to be in logical order
