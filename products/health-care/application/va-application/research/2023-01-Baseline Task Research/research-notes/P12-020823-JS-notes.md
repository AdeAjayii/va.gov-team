- Scroll to make sure I am on the right page
- Verify the web address is dot gov, then I would just sign in
- (change add) based on first impressions, no, nothing stands out to me I guess


**Participant questions:**
- On a scale of 1-5 (1 being very poorly and 5 being very well) - how prepared does this page make you feel about the application you are about to begin? Why did you give it that rating?

**Quotes, notes and observations:**
- no, not me, somebody might have a problem with there only being two sexes/genders. i am used to seeing the other option
- (quickly reads through American Indian page)
- (backs to American Indian) nothing seems unclear, i see you guys went thorugh extra effort to make sure groups are represented
- I know this doesn't apply to me so I just moved on
- (preferred method of contact) by the VA? probably email

**Quotes, notes and observations:**
- So just trying to undersand. I understand the different rating systems, I am not going off of it. 
- That is in the back of my mind, it is a simple yes or no questions in the moment I may have complicated it in my head. Percentages
- I don't receive any compensation
- The explanation of monthly payments
- (( check recording)
- It would have decluttered the screen a bit
- to me this asks the same question, just in a different way
- I don't know the difference between compensation and pension, but I know it doesn't apply to me

## Task: [Dates] - 3 minutes
**Quotes, notes and observations:**
- (used fake dates, was getting errors putting in dates for)
- Go back and read that, wasn't sure what that screen was
- Would I get more compensation if these things apply to me?
- (helpful context?) For me, these are not, to me these are not synonymous. Purple heart does not.. when I think of service history I think of time in service, rank
- I don't think of awards, that is just me
- Service history means something in the Air Force, for () and things like that

- It is not required, 
- I don't have a scanner and wouldn't go thorugh the trouble
- It is just a couple extra steps, I would just skip it and provide later if needed
- As far as instructions go, it is clear
- If I did not have them, it took me 5 minutes to 5 days, it depends. 
- Like the DD214, if I had one, it would be in a portfolio printed in a safe somewhere like that
- Or maybe I would have a digital file saved perhaps,
- What mailbox it is in, I have multiple emails 
- It just depends. 


### Things to watch for:

- (why) The only thing I can think of comparring it to is my taxes

[NPS Question]
- How likely are you to recommend this online application to another Veteran? [Scale of 0 - 10]

- Thinking back on the question about the first page you saw and you rated it a [x on a scale of 1-5 (1 being non very poorly and 5 being very well)], would you keep or change that rating after going through this application? Why?
Oh... it is kind of difficult to say. There was stuff it said I needed offhand and I didn't use that stuff.
I would say 5

- Did any of the questions stand out to you as unnecessary?
- Did anything seem to be missing?
