P4 Baseline usability study
2/1/2023 @ 1:00 PM ET

### Start application
-	[Stated would click sign in to start the application at the bottom]
-	Mentioned that #1 step is check eligibility; that could save you time if it “cancels you out”; “I think I would feel pretty prepared to start this – about a 4”
-	“I’m taking it that this is connected with all the other things that you sign in for – with ID.me etc…I would be hoping that it’s the same” [comments on blue sign in button as being similar to other government websites]
-	Suggested something stating “you can sign in with your this or this” [other ID.me etc sign in options] as additional context; would prefer to sign in if she knew it takes one of the familiar government sign in options; [after seeing sign in options] “I would have been hesitant on the other page” because she didn’t see these familiar options
-	Mentioned that if it’s connected to other sites “I would think [that it would pull in that other information]”

### Pre-check
-	[seemed straightforward]

Veteran information
-	[went back to put middle name in]
-	Commented on needing to put in social security number again, wondering if they are asking for verification; suggested “Since this is the information you just put in, why not just ask us to verify it?”; being asked to put it in again made her wonder if something was wrong (post screener duplicate info fields)
-	[Fills out mother’s maiden name
-	[Native American question page – reads over page and gives impression of understanding] Suggests simpler question: “Are you an Indian or protected group?” and suggested skipping over the more detailed info if you know it doesn’t apply to you
-	Seems to suggest generally having simpler questions that allows you to skip over more detail info if you know it doesn’t apply to you

### VA benefits
-	Stated current compensation page has something unclear: stated “Why we ask…” appears soon on the page; would want to know why we’re providing that instead of just answering the question first
-	Service periods page: mentioned multiple service period dates and confusion of how to input that; “You never know which date they want you to use” [updating to paper form specific date might help this]

### Military
-	Stated she would upload her DD214 from her computer; states most people have an electronic copy somewhere so it’s relatively easy to obtain/upload;
-	[Would change anything on upload page?] “Maybe they should ask for more than one set of DD214s” [mentions the ability upload multiple documents]; suggests something that indicates multiple documents can be uploaded “Upload all your DD214s for multiple service periods”

### Household information
-	[Reads over financial disclosure page] States she would not want to provide financial information because the government already knows this especially if you get retirement/etc from the gov already
-	Commented on the need to ask about other health insurance as a means to charge them instead of the VA covering; [answers no to health insurance question]; wondering why it was a concern of the VA what other coverage she had, if the VA only covers service-connected issues anyway

### Insurance info
-	[Facility locator part] Commented on not being able to go to the closest clinic due to the closest clinic not having the services she needed, especially because she is female; commented on it being frustrating that the system between the clinics near her aren’t necessarily connected
-	Stated that the VA contacting you is frustrating; the number isn’t necessarily updated when it is updated on new forms; VA picks old numbers
-	Preferred method of contact is cell phone or email

### Review
-	[Changing/editing answer task – is it clear?] Points out blue edit button; “I’m taking it that if I hit the edit button and I wanted to update in some way then I could”
-	[How prepared to submit does this make you?] 
-	[Any reason you would not submit?] No reasons to not submit; states that she hopes that if she had forgot to upload discharge papers for example, it should prevent submission so that it doesn’t trigger a long back-and-forth with the VA to get the DD214 info; “I would hope that if you haven’t attached some type of proof…whatever other discharge papers there are…that it just doesn’t accept it, because it’s kind of wasting everyone’s time.”
-	Stated she liked to see the confirmation page with some of her details; confirmation of submission was appreciated; 
-	Would like to know a time frame for when she would expect an answer, or some verification that someone is working on it, or something that indicates the process has started; would like confirmation on which contact method the VA will reach out with, email vs phone; prefers email message saying “It’s in the works” instead of a long wait time wondering what’s happening

### Post interview
-	[Recommend?] 9/10; would want to make sure that anyone she recommend this to was able to use the computer proficiently; computer literacy is an issue; program literacy is a issue; stated that this was pretty simple, but suggest font size could be larger
-	[How prepared vs first rating?] “The information flowed pretty smoothly”; suggest making sure the process to uploading documents be made clear, or maybe onboarding people to the need to have an electronic copy of a document before getting into the application
-	Stated that the insurance question is frustrating, still wonders why it matters since the VA covers service-connected stuff
-	Stated that onboarding people to electronic version of other documents, like household info stuff, would be helpful
