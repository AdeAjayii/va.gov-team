P11 notes – 2/7/23

### Start application

-	Stated nothing seemed unclear; “Self-explanatory”
-	[1-5 rating] “Very confident”; clicked on the “Why we ask…” dropdowns
-	Didn’t think it would take him long to gather his information; “Deductible expenses might take a little more homework than then rest”
-	Would normally sign in to start application; would use ID.me

### Pre-check

-	“All pretty basic”; Suggested putting middle name page/field in the beginning; stated he understood that it was just validating social/names, etc.

### Veteran information

-	Stated that dropdowns for state/city were useful; “That’s kind of standard stuff” to questions in general;
-	Stated that Native American info doesn’t apply to him; “It’s pretty self-explanatory”
-	[anything unclear?] “No I didn’t see anything at all”

### VA benefits

-	Asked if there was anything between 40 – 50% on the disability rating; seemed strange that between 40 – 50% seemed to be excluded based on how it was worded

Military service
-	Overall thought the questions were “pretty simple”; stated he would need DD214 for service date specifics
-	[Upload page] Stated he has a scanned copy of DD214 – would be able to upload it easily; keeps copy in Google docs

### Household information

-	Would prefer to provide financial information, but stated that since it says we will verify with the IRS, “It’s almost like it says you don’t need to do that [provide financial info]”;
-	[would you need to pause on spouse info?] “I would probably need to pause – I could find it fairly quickly but I imagine most people [wouldn’t be able to]”
-	“Pretty self-explanatory”
-	[Does have dependents] Had a question about “dependent relationship to you”: stated he’s raising his grandson – would expect to see something to that effect in dropdown; stated he keeps dependent’s info available (SSN, etc) so he would be able to get it relatively easily; “It’s all pretty simple”;
-	State he’s not sure why “permanently and totally disabled” question is being asked; “That seems like an odd question”
-	Suggested “N/A” option on “between 18 and 23 years of age” question; suggested something more clear for a resonse, like “yes I do have a dependent between…”; put “no” but seemed to think you shouldn’t have to enter an education amount; “Should kind of default to 0 if you select ‘no’ or ‘n/a’”
-	[more than on dependent?] clicked additional dependent button; [fix an error on dependent?] found edit button after some searching, fixed error and clicked update; seemed to figure that process out quickly
-	Stated he wouldn’t change/add anything necessarily on income page; suggested underlining “employment only” in the term definitions; suggested something to emphasize info in case you’re moving quickly through form
-	Stated “gross” income means everything to him, so it might be confusing if details are overlooked; read over gross income definition – through “include dependent’s income” meant include it in the dependents section; stated first sentence was kind of confusing
-	[deductible info page] opened up “what if my expenses…” info; stated the questions were very simple; “I think this is good, I think this is very clear”

### Insurance information

-	“About as simple as it gets”; thought initial insurance questions were “pretty straightforward”
-	[facility search page] [what criteria on how you would search for a clinic?] Suggested it might help if the dropdown was in alphabetical order; suggest building the full Facility locator function into the simple dropdown search page somehow; would prefer to have the more fleshed-out search tools
-	[Clicks link to Facility locator page – explore facility locator a bit]

### Review

-	[it is clear how to add/change answers?] stated yes and points out the edit button
-	Stated there’s no option to upload or change something to uploaded stuff on review page; suggest allowing to upload/change uploaded stuff on the review page
-	5/5 page makes him feel prepared to submit
-	[wouldn’t submit?] “Not unless I was questioning something I had put in there. That would be on me.”

### Confirmation
-	Suggest something indicating whether you can print the confirm page later on; maybe a warning saying you will not be able to print this page again if you leave

Post-interview
-	4/5 rating relative to first onboarding page; (same rating as first one?)
-	Didn’t think anything needed to be removed
