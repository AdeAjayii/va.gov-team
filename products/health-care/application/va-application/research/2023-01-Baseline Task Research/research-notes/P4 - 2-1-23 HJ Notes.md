# HJ Notes - Jan/Feb-2023 10-10EZ Baseline Tasks

Participant #4

Using IPhone
Would sign in to start the application
Intro page rating = 4

- Intro page
     - Suggests to add additional info about what signing in options (ID.me, Login.gov, etc) to the intro page - that would encourage signing in with confidence
     - Being hesitant on Intro page to hit the Sign In button before knowing what to expect

- Screener
     - Seems confusing, why not say “Verify these items” otherwise it makes you feel like you put something in wrong

- Compensation
     - Would feel compelled to read the “Why we are asking” details before moving on
     - Feels like it is a stop and prohibits the feeling of “Answering and moving on” 

- Military history
     - Unsure of what dates to enter, since there are multiple service periods

- Financial information
     - Would not want to provide financial information

- Marital status
     - Dont know what difference it would make but ok

- Insurance Information
     - Dont understand why they ask about other health care, why should it matter what other coverage I have
Why would it be a concern of VA if they only cover service connected, and i need other coverage to manage the rest of my care

- Facility selection
     - you can pick all you want, but they [VA] will tell you if you can even use that clinic
     - VA contacting you - They only use a number from years ago, they dont update their systems.

- Review page
     - Feels pretty good about submitting
     - Felt like it should throw an error message without uploading dd214
     - Would hope that is the case, better than waiting 4 months to hear they [VA] are waiting for that.

- Submission page
     - Would like a timeline to expect processing to be done
     - Perhaps an email with that info
     - Have How they will contact you and what timeline to expect

- Likely to recommend = 9
     - I would want to make sure they would be able to use a computer
     - Would suggest to have a document, take a picture of your dd214

- Intro page re-rating = 
     - Would recommend having details on the DD214 document upload preparation [clearly did not read the intro page]

- Miscellaneous
     - I would like to see it larger - font size
     - the smaller words would cause us (older people) not to do something
     - I am never going to agree with the additional insurance questions
