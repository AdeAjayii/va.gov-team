Baseline study P2 notes
1/27/23 @ 1pm ET

### Start application
-	Mentioned the red Veteran crisis link at top (so did P1)
-	Stated that asking for income/deductible information and tax info made him “a little bit thrown off”, “kind of intimidating”; “makes me uncomfortable that they want that information”; was confused as to how this related to health care
-	Stated he thought the determination was made on disability, not how much money you make
-	Probably wouldn’t continue at this time because he would need to gather information
-	Expected to see something about how private insurance works with / affects VA healthcare (then saw the note under “Why we ask…”); stated that cleared it up for him
-	Would sign in to start application; clicks bottom blue button [IE probably blocked popup]

### Pre-check
-	[None]

### Veteran info
-	Commented on what he’s heard about how long the approval process takes; mentioned the “we can review your application faster is you provide more information”
-	Spends some time reviewing “Need help?” section
-	Mentioned the progress bar staying at step 1 of 6 as something he doesn’t like
-	Uneasy about giving mother’s maiden name; was worried about previous lost/stolen laptops with personal info, so including such detail made him uneasy
-	Stated it “would be nice if they provided the reason why” the VA wants race/ethnicity information
-	Native American info question: stated “Indian” is probably not politically correct; 
-	Mentions progress bar step 1 or 6 “throwing him off” still; makes it seem like form is going to take much longer; suggests an estimated time at the beginning of form; suggest something like “step 1A, step 1B…this is something I might need to take home [and complete] when I have some free time” [due to expected length]
-	“In my experience there’s a link to add another box like this [for additional address lines]”

### Disability & benefits
-	Stated he likes the “Why do we ask…” dropdown; 
-	Mentioned quick change between step 2 and step 3 between benefits and military service

### Military service / upload
-	Stated he was still waiting to receive his DD214
-	Stated service history was pretty straightforward; 
-	[Asked about how he would upload] “I would scan it and send it to my email. If I’m accessing it from a website I would save it as a pdf.”
-	Stated he expected it to confirm the upload if he had uploaded something

### Financial disclosure
-	Mentioned move to step 4
-	“IRS is not a nice word, right” – uneasy at the mention of the IRS/tax stuff; [reading through on boarding stuff]
-	[Unclear?] “No, pretty cut and dry” [for explanatory info]
-	States he was thrown off – couldn’t remember if in the beginning the application told him he would have to provide tax info etc.

### Marital status
- [None]

### Dependents
- [None]

### Annual income
-	[Reading through stuff – seemed to make sense for the most part]
-	Mentioned stock dividends he gets,  but wasn’t sure if he was made aware he would need to get that info; stated that would make him want to go back and decline to offer financial info because of the work involved

### Deductible info
-	Mentioned the need to stop and gather specific information; has most of this information scanned; [Time estimate for gathering info?] “10 – 15 minutes”
-	Stated he would need more clarity on education question; sometimes he attends one-off career building events/seminars/webinars; wanted to know if these counted, or how they factored in

### Insurance info
-	Mentioned the change to step 5 of 6
-	Impression of facility search: “Pretty cut and dry…This is great, I love dropdown boxes”; [Asked about thought process] Stated he has a lot of friends that are Veterans, and they talk about which clinics are good vs which are horrible; has had friends tell him to go with certain clinics over others (didn’t see the facility he was looking for in list);
-	Clicked on facility locator tool link (new tab); stated he would use the location search tool in a real situation [took some time to explore facility locator]

### Review page
-	Stated he’s glad this page has the option to edit things; looking to verify his information
-	[1-5] “Makes me feel very confident…I love that it’s in sections…I’m very confident that I would use this, I think it’s great.”
-	[Wouldn’t submit?] “If I see some information that’s missing…or if I change my mind about some of the information.”
-	Mentioned he liked editing on the page

### Confirmation page
-	“Check mark green tells me it’s a go.”
-	Stated he would print this screen; (actually printed something); stated the print out is a little different than what’s on the page, but overall it’s what he would expect

### Post interview
-	Would recommend the online application; stated that most Vets think they don’t have a choice and they just have to go through whatever application process they have to go through regardless
-	Same rating for intro page (4) post application
-	Overall stated it doesn’t make sense how providing tax info factors into healthcare, based on his previous experience
-	Stated he thought the application would request info from his current physician/therapist; thought he might have needed to provide that
