## Research Goals
The online health care application (10-10EZ) and the update form (10-10EZR which is only paper form today) can both impact a Veteran's eligibility and placement when applying for and managing their health care benefits. This is more so impactful for those placed in a Priority Group who need to have income information considered for copays and travel reimbursement in addition to eligibility. The 10-10EZ is the initial application that then places a Veteran in a Priority Group for enrollment into the full medical benefits package. The 10-10EZR is used to provide personal, financial or insurance information updates after enrollment.

The outcome of this generative research study will help in understanding the Veteran's mental model around health care benefits as it pertains to understanding and maintaining those benefits - specifically around awareness of their Priority Group and that impact as well as updating financial information after initial enrollment.

## Methodology 
We conducted hour-long moderated usability tests on Zoom from August 14-August 21, 2023.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. Hypothesis
   1. **TRUE or FALSE**: Reason
2. Hypothesis
   1. **TRUE or FALSE**: Reason
3. We assume not all Veterans go through the enrollment process in one go, there is often stops, such as an exam and other claims filed in between that could impact their enrollment and Priority Group placement.
   1. **MAYBE TRUE**: Several Veteran participants conflated the disability claim process with the health care enrollment process. Because disability rate is important for some Priority Groups and not for others, it's difficult to come to an 
4. We assume there is a desire from Veterans for the Priority Group placement to be more clear as it pertains to benefits, copays, costs and travel reimbursement.
   1. **MAYBE TRUE**: Most Veterans responded positively to the idea of Priority Group info being more conveniently placed and more clear, but some were ambivalent or did not consider Priority Group info important to their own access of health care benefits.
5. We assume that Veterans would like to update their financial information online if it was available but need a clear way to be communicated to or notified that they have to do so.
   1. **TRUE**: All 12 participants responded that they would prefer notification (email, push notifications in the app, a letter) to update their financial information if/when they needed to do so.
6. We think that Veterans will go to the VA profile to update personal information like financial updates annually.
   1. **TRUE**: 11 out of 12 Veterans navigated to or mentioned the VA Profile when prompted to go to the part of VA.gov where they would expect to update financial information.


## Key Findings

### Primary Findings
1. Veterans were able to edit and remove dependents with relative ease using the new experimental pattern.
2. Finding dependents from review page can be a challenge.
3. Veterans take their time and are careful when completing form fields.
4. It's unclear to Veterans why they need to submit data that IRS later verifies.

### Secondary Findings
1. Veterans want transparency into lengthy, messy VA processes.
2. Login is still a frustration for Veterans who want the benefit of an authenticated experience.



## Details of Findings 


**Veterans were able to edit and remove dependents with relative ease using the new experimental pattern.**


Participants seemed to have no trouble editing and removing dependents from their application, stating they found both the interaction with this new pattern to be clear and intuitive.

**Finding dependents from review page can be a challenge.**


Some participants struggled with finding their dependents within the bulk of information on the Review page. Nearly every participant stated they would expand every section to review their submission, resulting in a large amount of content to search through.

**Veterans take their time and are careful when completing form fields.**


Our Veteran participants mentioned want to get things correct, reading content cautiously and checking their work.

**It's unclear to Veterans why they need to submit data that IRS later verifies.**


Several Veterans mentioned they know their income and household information will be verified by the IRS. Filling out this portion of the form that the IRS already has data on seemed unnecessary.

**Veterans want transparency into lengthy, messy VA processes.**


Participants mentioned wanted transparency around how long the application process might take, acknowledging that VA processes can take longer than expected.

**Login is still a frustration for Veterans who want the benefit of an authenticated experience.**


Some Veteran participants expressed frustration with the cumbersome login experience. The ability to login is valuable, allowing them to save their work and pre-fill information—this login tension dilutes their over VA.gov experience.

> P#: "Quote.”



## Recommendations

* Continue using and monitoring the usability of the experimental pattern for adding, editing, and removing dependents.
* Explore ways to lessen the burden of submitting information that IRS has available already.



## Next Steps

We will work with the rest of the 1010 team, our stakeholders, and the Authenticated Experience team to pilot a new online version of the 10-10EZR, making the form accessible (either through a link or other means) where it makes the most sense for Veterans to find.
