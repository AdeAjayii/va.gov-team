# Analytics
This directory contains analytics and associated reports tracking the performance and kpi's for the HCA Duplication Submission effort.  Pre launch data is the week of 6/7/19 - 6/13/19, each week after launch is represented as a week #.

## Goals
Reduce the number of duplication applications

## Measures
Currently measuring 

* Total # of applications submitted
* Total # of new application (gives reflection of total duplicate)
* Anonymous (logged out) vs. Authenticated (logged in)

Giving us good insight into 

* % of duplicates
* Changes in total # of applications overall
