# Initiative Outline - Improve Facility Selection on the 10-10EZ

## Overview
* We want to simplify the process for a Veteran to select their VA facility when applying for health care by ensuring that they can select the correct one, whether it be based on distance from them or looking for a specific facility.


### Problems to Solve
* Facility names change often and Veterans may know a facility based on location and not name.
* Veterans may also be unaware of other VA locations that are actually closer to (and potentially more convenient for) them.
* The current layout of the page is complicated and unintuitive.


### Desired User Outcomes
* Facility selection becomes easy and simple.
* Veterans can select the specific facility they want based on knowledge, location, etc..


### Undesired User Outcomes
* Facility selection becomes complicated or difficult.
* Veterans face _analysis paralysis_ due to volume of information presented to them.


### Desired Business Outcomes
* Veterans select the correct facility and book appointments at the location they actually intend to visit.


### Undesired Business Outcomes
* Veterans select the incorrect facility when applying for health care and need information/appointments manually changed/updated.

 ## Measuring Success
 We are still determinng the best ways of measuring succes via metrics for this update.  We currently have the following ideas:
 * User feedback (Medallia)

### Baseline KPI Values
* TBD

### Objectives and Key Results
* Objective: Make it easier for Veterans to apply for healthcare and select the facility that's correct for them.
  * Key Result: TBD

## Assumptions
* Veterans want to select the facility that's best for them.  This selection may be determined based off: location; size; distance from them; or other/multiple factors.
 
### Initial Goals 
* Update the current search functionality with an updated API service for a more complete and accurate facilities list (and with locations).
* Update the current UI to be easier to use and understand.

### Risks
* Applicantsa may not understand the reason for selecting a facility.
* Applicants may not understand how to use the facility selector/search.
* Applicants may be given too much information about facility, location, and so on and feel overwhelmed when making a decision.
* API dependencies may cause unplanned outages, causing the facility selector page to be unresponsive,

 ## Solution Approach
 * Provide an updated facility selection page that is easy to use and understand.
   * Connect with active Facilities API in place of the current static JSON file
   * Revisit UI against the current Facilities selection page on VA.gov and otehr private sector locator search pages
   * Condust research/usability sessiosn with Veterans to determine the best, easiest to use design
   * Redesign facility selection page
 * Provide Veterans with an idea of location/distance of any given facility to ensure they can select the one that is correct for them.
