# Initiative Brief - 10-10EZ Registration Path

## Outcome Summary
Provide Veterans who will be transitioning out of service in the near future and allow them to fill out the 10-10EZ form in advance of their separation date, so that the application can be processed at that time.

- Epic | [Registration Path #43221](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/43221)

## Problem
There is an interest from the HEC (Health Eligibilty Center) and VEO (Veteran Experience Office) stakeholders to include a registration-only pathway for the online 10-10EZ application.

## Desired User Outcomes
- Provide Veterans the ability to complete the 10-10EZ form prior to their separation date and be confident the application will be processed once they have left service.
- 

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Confusion between what it means to register vs. enroll, and whether the online application should be used for one or the other.

## Desired Business Outcomes
TBD

## Undesired Business Outcomes
TBD
