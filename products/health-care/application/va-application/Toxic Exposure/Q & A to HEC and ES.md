# Questions and Answers to HEC Stakeholders and Enrollment System teams 

### Veteran behavior/staff processing
- [ ] What is the main goal?
     - [ ] **Jessie** - VBA/VHA working together. Benefit is gather as much info as possible, to get Veteran in higher priority group.  If VHA cant determine TERA, VBA will assist with research to get Veteran in better PG.  VHA can determine - PG6, if not, then VBA will get a request to assist.  Target Audience - Veterans in PG7 or PG8, or Veterans who may not be eligible at all (Deferred).
- [ ] Do we need to gather all the applicable data for these questions?
     - [ ] 
- [ ] Are all the questions *required?
     - [ ] Jessie Questions are optional
- [ ] Can the Veteran only answer one of the questions that meets eligibility criteria without having to fill out everything that applies?
     - [ ] Jessie - Need one qualifying event to get into PG6
     - [ ] Jessie - May want to encourage to answer all that could apply - the more info provided is better
     - [ ] Taccara - Each question is directed to a diff cohort (location, exposure, contingent), Answer any of them can validate them to move to a higher PG
     - [ ] Tacarra - almost like a safeguard, a fallback in case any other status is lost.
- [ ] Will answering all the questions/data provide a different outcome for the Veteran applying for health care?

- [ ] What about impact to existing short form flow?
     - [ ] Do those who answer yes to having a rating of 50% or higher need to answer these new Toxic Exposure questions going forward?
          - [ ] Need SME advisement
     - [ ] How does that impact the outcome for the Veteran getting health care?
          - [ ] 
- [ ] Same question, but for those with 10-40% - should they answer the exposure questions or will that not impact their enrollment prioritization?
     - [ ]
