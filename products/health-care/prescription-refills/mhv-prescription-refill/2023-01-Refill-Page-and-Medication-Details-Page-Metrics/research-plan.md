# **Research Plan for Refill Page and Medication Details Page Metrics**

This research plan is being submitted on behalf of the Human Center Design (HCD) team at By Light Professional IT Services. The team is currently conducting discovery research for a better understanding of the uses of the VA Refill Prescriptions and Medication Details pages, the roles they hold for Veterans, and analytics pertaining to those pages.

**Background**

Significant changes have been proposed to the Medication Details page found on My HealtheVet including UI design, informational fields, and more. Before such changes are iterated on, it is critical to get a better understanding of the relationship Veterans have with those pages so a more satisfactory experience can be developed.

This research will also provide useful information for the upcoming merger between My HealtheVet and VA.gov. While findings from this research might not apply to My HealtheVet directly, it will be useful for development under VA.gov.

OCTO Objectives

This research applies to multiple OCTO objectives, including:

1. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.

2. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

Veteran Journey

This research directly relates to providing Veterans with the tools they need to take care of their health.

**Research Goals**

1. Have a better understanding of why Veterans visit the VA Refill Prescription Page.
  1. Define actions Veterans expect to take on the page.
  2. What do Veterans do when they are on the page? Are there any actions they wish they could take?
    1. How can we facilitate those actions?
2. Discover why Veterans open the Medication Details page to prepare for any necessary redesign.
  1. How many Veterans are aware of this page and utilize its resource?
  2. What information are Veterans looking for when they open the Medications Page?
  3. What actions do Veterans take on the Medications Page? Are there any actions they are unable to take but wish they could?
    1. What information are Veterans expecting on a Medication Details page? How can we provide Veterans with that information?

Outcome

The results of this research will directly affect all future design decisions regarding the Refill Page and Medication Details page. This information will give us a solid foundation of understanding for what Veterans need, expect, and want from these pages.

Hypothesis

We believe that the Refill Prescriptions page and Medication Details page need adjustments to better fit Veteran needs and that this research is critical to discover what needs to change. Furthermore, we believe that this research will provide crucial information for future design changes.

**Methodology**

We are planning to gather data through contextual inquiry with an interview structure. This will include moderated remote interviews over Zoom, where Veterans who are familiar with My HealtheVet and refilling prescriptions will walk through their routine and answer questions related to their experience.

Location

These interviews will be conducted remotely through Zoom.

**Recruitment**

We will be utilizing Perigean for our interview pool.

Recruitment criteria

We are looking for a minimum of 20 Veterans who are comfortable refilling prescriptions online on My HealtheVet. It does not matter if they use a smartphone, tablet or computer.

We are looking for Veterans of all demographics, experience and age. We are more concerned about their proficiency at refilling medications on My HealtheVet or if they are comfortable with the Refill VA Prescription's page.

**Timeline**

We would like to begin conducting interviews as early as January 4th, 2023 if possible.

Prepare

Research sessions

Research will begin on January 4th, 2023 and will continue until 20 interviews have been completed.

Length of sessions

We are expecting each interview to last no longer than 1 hour. These interviews are low stress and should consist of Veterans taking us through their routine and answering questions we have. As such, we expect to be able to conduct 3 interview sessions per day.
