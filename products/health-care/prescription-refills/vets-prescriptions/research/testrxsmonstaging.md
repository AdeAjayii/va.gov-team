### Do you want to see what Rx and SM look like? Below are instructions:

Go to https://staging.vets.gov/healthcare/prescriptions (you may be prompted for a username/password before the site will load; use username: `veterans` and password: `am3rica`). 

Click Sign In and use username: `vets.gov.user+264@gmail.com` to log into ID.me.

You can obtain the password for `vets.gov.user+264@gmail.com` from the [Test User Dashboard](https://tud.vfs.va.gov). If you do not have the required [SOCKS proxy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Request-access-to-tools.969605215.html#Requestaccesstotools-SetuptheSOCKSproxy) set up to view the Test User Dashboard, a full list of staging test users is in [mvi-staging-users.csv](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/vagov-users/mvi-staging-users.csv), though the accounts on this list will not be as up to date as those managed through the Test User Dashboard.

That login has @ayaleloehr's phone number attached to it, but in staging the 2FA code automatically populates instead of needing to be entered manually, so that won't be a problem. Click Continue to send the code, click Continue again once the code has been auto-populated, and then Allow, and you should be logged in. 

That should get you into prescriptions. The only request is that you don't actually click "confirm" to actually refill a prescription, as we only have a limited of those and have to keep asking MHV to get more.

That user also has access to secure messaging. Go to https://staging.vets.gov/healthcare/messaging to see this application as well. Feel free to send as many messages as you want with this one (and if you want a response, select that you're sending them to the group with name "SLC" in it and ping @ayaleloehr and I can respond).

Let me know if you have any questions/issues with any of those steps or any feedback.

### Feedback?
