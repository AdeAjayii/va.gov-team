# Call with Carnetta Scruggs on My VA Treating Facilities
June 14, 2023

Attendees: Carnetta and Florence McCafferty

## Knowns
- This field is user-defined ONLY
- The dropdown options given to the user are created through a call to the IM System Office, which tracks for each Veteran the VAMC(s) with the Veteran's medical record

## Is the data from this field used elsewhere in MHV?
Yes, in one place: the helpdesk. 

If this field were to disappear and no longer be available from VA.gov My Health, this would limit the helpdesk's ability to identify the correct VAMC for the Veteran calling (according to Carnetta, identifying the correct VAMC is a significant bottleneck for helpdesk calls) 

When helpdesk has a call with a Veteran, the data in this field enables helpdesk employee to transfer Veteran to the exact person in the exact VAMC they need to talk to (which allows Veteran caller to avoid making another call to get an answer)
