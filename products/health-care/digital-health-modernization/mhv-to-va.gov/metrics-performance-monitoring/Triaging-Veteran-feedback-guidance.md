# MHV on VA.gov Veteran Feedback: Triaging feedback and strategizing response
Last Updated: 07/18/2023

# Goal of document: 
To outline a strategy to monitor Veteran feedback through the MHV Feedback email (email) and other feedback mechanisms. This strategy can be applied to any of the health services on MHV on VA.gov (Secure Messaging, Medical Records, Appointments, and Medications). 

## Who is responsible? 
Delivery teams are responsible for monitoring Veteran feebdack, in line with their broader feedback strategy, and facilitating the process of triaging what feedback gets acted upon. 

## Steps 
1. Identify if the feedback is a user support issue, product feedback, or other type of feedback.
2. If feedback is determined to be user support issue, create a Jira or ZenHub ticket and route as needed.
3. If feedback is determined to be product feedback, group feedback and flag for review my product managers, who will decide whether a ticket needs to be made to address feedback. Product managers can reach out to OCTO Product Owners if unsure.
4. If feedback determined to be "other" (not user support, not product feedback), discuss the feedback in product-specific channel and tag OCTO Product Owners to decide how to route.
