# Meeting with Susan Haidary
Date: June 5, 2023
Attendees: Susan Haidary, Florence McCafferty, Patrick Bateman

## How do users primarily get support?
- Number 1: Call help desk
- If lucky, user can access coordinator at a CBOT and coordinator gets the info needed to address the issue
- If the issue is technical, it is escalated to tier 3 (POC re: tier 3: Sean Good)

## What are the different contact centers/help desks that serve MHV?
### MHV Help Desk
- POC: Patty Henry
- Run by HRC (Health Resource Center)
- Veterans call into this help desk, as do Coordinators on Veterans' behalf (user issues)
- Concern/issue is associated with a ticket

### "Contact us" form on MHV
- This goes into IRIS system
- No ticketing system when they use this form 

### Secure messaging support
- Help desk does not offer user support around Secure Messaging
- Instead, there is a secure messaging field questions group that communicates via email listserv

### MHV Neighborhood on Teams
- Help each other with questions about problems users are running into

### Coordinators
- If users reach out to a coordinator at a CBOT, the coordinator will chase down answers for them
- At this point, we haven't been able to learn how coordinators are tracking or reporting back the issues that they are helping users with 

## Remaining questions
- How can we get access to data from the HRC-run MHV call center? (Patty Henry might be able to answer this question)
- Is it possible for us to get access to the Secure Messaging user support email listserv?
- How do central office folks keep track of what coordinators are hearing from Veterans (specifically about using MHV)?
