|**Last Fill Date**|This field is used to indicate the last date the prescription was filled. The dates in this field will be the date of the last renew from a previous rx, and any subsequent fills. VistA field name is FILL DATE.||||Questions: Need clarity around "filled." Is this related to a prescription status or a refill status? Does it mean the last time a prescription was ordered/renewed or last time it was refilled? How are Veterans using this date and do they have an accurate understanding of what it actually means?
|**Expiration Date**|This date is the date on which the prescription is no longer fillable. VistA will always have an expiration date ( unless the RX is pending)|expirationDate |||Questions: Does "no longer fillable" mean "renewable" or "refillable?" Can we confirm this doesn't relate to the pills expiration use? Why would a prescription expire? Who determines this date (doctor, pharmacist)? Why is this date important to Veterans? How are they using this date?

|**CMOP Date Shipped**|The date/time the prescription was shipped to the patient from the CMOP.||||Questions: Does this actually mean a prescription was shipped (on the truck out for delivery)? Or does that mean a tracking label was created (prescription could still be sitting in the pharmacy bin waiting to be picked up, could also mean it is actually out for delivery, and could also mean it's already been delivered but we still have the tracking number assigned to it)? Why is this date important to Veterans? How are they using this date?
