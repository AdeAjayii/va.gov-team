## Intro

Thank you for joining us today! My name is <>. I am a user researcher with the VA within the office of the CTO. I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 

I work primarily on VA.gov and currently I’m part of a team exploring what it would take to bring MHV products to VA.gov. I work with Coulton, Lauren, and Kay on this project, who you might have heard or worked with them before. For this meeting, I want to hear about everything you know about we will MHV pharmacy and ask some of usability questions since you have worked on that as a <>. The purpose of this work is to integrate MHV more tightly with VA.gov so that we are able to deliver a more unified and complete product and service experience to Veterans.

Lastly, a few things I want to mention before we dive in:

This entire session should take about an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. It's not a problem. 

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you? Great! Any questions before we get started?
