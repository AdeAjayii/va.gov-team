# Background

Today patients can access their medication data from Blue Button report and MHV’s pharmacy section. Patients can download their entire VA medication data including self-report medications and supplements through Blue Button. For all active medications and medications that have been inactive for fewer than 180 days, patients can view and take actions under pharmacy section on MHV. We know that there are policies governing what medication data should be displayed and constraints for how it should be displayed, but we don’t know which data source is the most reliable, how data is stored, how exactly pharmacy functionality in MHV work, and some of the intricate challenges that limits va.gov to have complete and accurate data. This research will help us deeply understand those questions, and most importantly give us insights on creating a standardized and consistent medication data for Veterans.  

# Veteran Journey

* Taking care of myself 
  * Managing primary care and chronic health issues - This moment matters because there’s knowledge transfer between providers leads to Veterans experiencing discontinuity in healthcare.
  * Maintaining my health 
* Aging

# Research goals

Pharmacy and medications data plays an important role in Veterans health management. Understanding the usability and source of the data, pharmacy and medications functionality, and the data policies will help our team improve the pharmacy and medication functionality and create a Veterans centric experience on va.gov.  
 
The purposes of this research are:  
- To deeply understand the pharmacy and medciation functionality today in MyHealtheVet. 
- To deeply understand the pharmacy and medciation functionality today for VA mobile app. 
- To understand how active, expired, and discontinued prescriptions are refilled and renewed. 
- To understand what medication treatment plan and pre-visit summary are, how they are used, and why they are important to Veterans and providers. 

# Outcomes

By the end of this research effort, we will be able to:

- Deliver requirements for how to transition MyHealtheVet pharmacy functionality to VA.gov
- Deliver comparison analysis among MyHealtheVet pharmacy and VA mobile app and RxRefill app in order to make sure medications on VA.gov align with other tools.
- Deliver task flows for an optimized user experience of renewing and refilling medications. 
- Deliver wireframes to present the changes for improving the user experience of pharmacy functionlity for Veterans. 
- Deliver recommendations for implementing medication treatment plan and pre-visit summary on VA.gov in the near future.

# Research questions 

## Clinical:
- What are the limitations of medication data on MHV from a clinical point of view? 
- What are all the use cases for medications data, such as viewing, refilling, and renewing?  
- Are there limitations to how a patient can renew a prescription?  
  - How does this apply to different types of drugs (e.g., controlled vs not controlled substances)?  
  - How do these limitations impact the user experience? 
- Why do allergies need to be shown on the same page as medications? 
- What is the difference between a medications list and a medications treatment plan? 
  - Do users have access to a medication treatment plan, why or why not? 
- Is there anything Veterans need do to receive correct medications when they move or switch facilities? 
- What are the medications requirements for CHAMPVA patients?  
- What are the differences in requirements between medications for refills and medications for renewal?  
- How long before medications expire or discontinue a user should be notified? 
- How is pre-visit summary currently used?  

## Usability:
- How do Veterans access their medication data today? 
- What actions can Veterans take on their medication list today (e.g., request a refill)? 
- How do Veterans track the status of their medications? 
- How do Veterans learn when a medication has been shipped that they requested a refill for? 
- How do Veterans request changes to their medication list or enter medications that aren’t present?  
- What are the use cases for Veterans to download medication data that’s 180 days past dispense date? 

# Hypotheses 

- Allergies on MHV pharmacy page might not be useful or important information for users. 
- Users might not know the differences between RxRefill app and VA mobile app and MHV medication on VA.gov.
- It's challenging for users who take lots of medications to keep track which medications need to refill or renewal on time. 
- There are a lot of different prescription statuses, and users might not know what all those mean and what actions they should or shouldn’t take regarding their medications’ status. 
- There is no clear reason on why Veterans need to access active and inactive medication data separately from MyHealtheVet and Blue Button report. 
- Users don’t manage their self-reported medications often.
