## Intro

Thank you for joining us today! My name is <>. I am a user researcher with the VA within the office of the CTO. I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 

I work primarily on VA.gov and currently Iâ€™m part of a team exploring what it would take to bring MHV products to VA.gov. I work with Coulton, Lauren, and Kay on this project. You might have heard or worked with them before. For this meeting, we will primarily focus on MHV pharmacy. The purpose of this work is to integrate MHV more tightly with VA.gov so that we are able to deliver a more unified and complete product and service experience to Veterans.

We had a brief meeting last November. Now that we plan to kick off the medication project officially this quarter, we want to continue working closely with you on this work to make sure we are not only designing the best pharmacy experience for Veterans, but also incorporate you all's knowledge on the requirements of medication data. 

Lastly, a few things I want to mention before we dive in:

This entire session should take about an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. It's not a problem. 

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you? Great! Any questions before we get started?
