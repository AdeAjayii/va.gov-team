# MHV on va.gov: Medications Product Outline
---

## Overview
Medications on VA.gov will provide Veterans with the ability to view, renew, refill, and track their VA based medications regardless of which VA facility they seek care at, as well as the ability to view and confirm non-VA medications. The new application will employ modern technology and user-centered design to ensure that the tool is accessible, straightforward, and simple to use. Moving this product into the VA.gov landscape will also provide a more seamless and consistent experience for the Veteran’s overall health care needs.

## Problem Statement
This is part of a larger initiative to move all Veteran transactions around managing their healthcare to a central portal, rather than having multiple websites and mobile applications to do the same Medication transactions. The current application is associated with prescriptions and prescription refills, but the goal is for Veterans to think of Medications they take holistically and give them information they can use to discuss with their provider. The first iteration will just take what is available today in the “Prescriptions” part of MHV, but will not include self-entered medication as there is not a direct connection for VA providers to see that information. 

 How might we provide a singular web-based portal for Veterans to: 
- View all medications- including VA prescribed medications with all the information about medications (images, descriptions, name, etc. 
- Renew VA prescribed medications
- Refill and trach VA prescribed medications
- View, download, and print all EHR-based medications and allergies for a Veteran
- Complete medication reconciliation digitally

## Desired User Outcomes
The Medications application will provide an easy way to see all medications that are on record for them at the VA in the Electronic Health Record (EHR). It will allow them to reference that information for outside care, point out any issues/questions/anomalies to their provider, request refills and renewals for medications, and align new medications to an episode of care (appointment). 

*We want users to be able to:*
- See the list of their medications that are on file at the VA. This includes VA based medications, and if there are non-VA based meds on file, show those. Do not show self-entered meds that the EHR does not know about.
- Renew, refill, and track VA based meds.
- View a pre-visit medications summary that outlines the medications on file for them, and that they can communicate with their provider at their visit about changes to that medication or eventually communicate digtally.
## Undesired User Outcomes
- Medication section doesn’t provide the user with the same function that they have today- causing frustration and dissatisfaction. 
- Avoid Veteran confusion about medications they are taking. 
- Misalignment in data and functionality on VA Health and Benefits Application and MHV on va.gov. 

## Desired Business Outcomes

*Why would your business want this to exist?*
Allowing users to understand and self-service medication needs leads to more timely care, reduces burden on clinical staff, and increases patient safety.
*With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
- Have one web-based patient portal to enhance and improve for Veterans- rather than spending time and effort with other teams to do the same things in multiple places. 
- Easily accessible and identifiable medications list will alleviate congressional and patient safety questions.

## Measuring Success-TBD

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Assumptions
- MVP will include all the functionality available today in MHV Pharmacy- View and Refill Medications
- MVP doesn’t include renewal of prescriptions
- Other “Prescriptions” applications have done research that shows what features most Veterans look for in a Medications space


## Solution Approach
Provide a Medications section of the new portal on va.gov and that will allow Veterans to view medications in the EHR, communicate about medications with provider team, and print meds and allergies list. 

Specific solution is dependent on Research and Discovery of the Medications section.
