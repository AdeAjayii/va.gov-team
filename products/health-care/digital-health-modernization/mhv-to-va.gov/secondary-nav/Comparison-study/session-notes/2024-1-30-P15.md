Screen sharing instructions: 

M: I just want to explain it to you briefly. So I want you to do is just kind of imagine, you know, you're receiving this email in your typical email inbox.

P: Okay.

M: So what you use Gmail or AOL or Yahoo, you're just receiving this email so you can just go ahead and read it and follow the prompt.

P: Okay.

M: And then I'm assuming you've probably seen this screen before. Okay.

P: I've I've looked at some stuff before. As far as records and things like that.

M: Okay.

P: So.

M: Great. So, yeah, you arrived on the site. I would love exactly what you're doing. Just kind of like look around on this one page before clicking anything. And I'd love to hear Claudine like, if it's at all surprising. That you landed here or if this is the type of thing you'd expect. To land on in that link.

P: No, this is something I would expect. Oh, I just. So. I could. Okay, so. Yeah. I'm looking, that what I'm doing is I'm looking at the screen saying, okay, I can't look at the results. There's no option Is that just something that . 

M: I will ask you shortly to go find them. You're totally spot on. I wanted to ask you, you know, like in in our imagination, you received the link in your email, you click that link signed in and then showed up here.

P: Okay.

M: Is that was that weird at all? Was that like the right order of events?

P: It's not weird at all. Yeah. Oh, actually, when, with my healthy vet.

M: Okay, cool.

P: With secure messaging, the the email I get at Gmail just says I have a new message from my doctor. It doesn't tell me. Any other information except to, to log in to that to check my messages. So I don't know that. The information that you sent like the link would. Show up in my Gmail. So I don't think I would be going through my Gmail. I think I'd still need to log in to the Yeah.

M: Okay, okay, awesome. Yeah, that is really helpful information and exactly what I was asking you for. Thank you. Great. And then it seems like you've mentioned this, but I just want to ask really clearly. How would you describe where you've landed?

P: It looks like I've landed in my in well. A message in my index in the secure messaging section.

M: Okay, cool. And that's you said you've used secure messaging. A good number of times. Okay. So, as you already guessed, next I want you to imagine that your, You wanna look at the images from your x-ray?

P: Yeah.

M: And I'm wondering where you would go to do that. So, and just possible, I'd love to hear your thoughts out loud.

P: Okay.

M: So tell me what you're looking for.

P: About the notification. We're getting now when there's a new secure message. There's an option to, you know, if there's an if you have a new message, will notify you via Gmail. It would be. Gmail would give a little more information. Like, cause I sometimes I go in and I'll send several messages to different doctors and when I get a response, I don't know which one it is and I have to go log in and If I knew that it was like this doctor responding or that doctor is funny, but I don't know if that,

M: Interesting. 

P: Yeah. That's just what I would, would think have you really had to know which doctor would actually respond.

M: Yeah, absolutely. That makes a lot of sense to me. Cool, very helpful comment.

P: So if you were looking for those x-ray images, I'm just curious to know what you. What you're looking for to try to find those.

M: I would go back to the, my main screen on my healthy vet and I believe of all the options.

P: There's one for test results or something of that kind of genre.

M: Okay. Okay, great. Yeah, so feel free you can kind of click around to get where you 

P: Okay. I go to medical records. That's test results. Okay, so I see that ABLE left 3 views is probably the one that the messages are going to.


M: Yeah, exactly. That's kind of the intention.


P: Yeah, and then the EKG microbiology, so yeah.

M: Great. Awesome. And then, I'm gonna give you another task. I want you to, that you need to make a follow-up appointment. So where would you go to do that?

P: Let's see. I'm gonna go back to the just link at the top to start like from the beginning and then go to appointment.

M: Okay.

P: At this point. I would start scheduling and. To see if it was available. The email or the message said, tell a health appointment. I've never tried to do a telehealth appointment. Schedule. I mean, the one in the appointments app part. So. This part would be Not appointment, just that. The video appointment part.

M: Okay. Right. Okay. Yep, that makes sense. Okay, now a third task. I want you to imagine that you need to order CPAP supplies to help you breathe when you're sleeping. Where did you go to order those supplies?

P: Well, the only thing I can think of is under medications because it's something that would be prescribed. I believe, but I don't know that. I don't know what CPU would go through as far as like the Medical supplies.

M: Right. Okay, that makes sense. So let me, oh go ahead, what were you gonna say?

P: Okay. Gonna say so the next thing I would probably do is is go into the secure messages And when you do the dropdown.

M: Okay.

P: We are going to send it to. It gives you a list of people you can send messages to. So. I would probably go in there and see if there was anything there for. Can't remember the I don't look at that. Just that prosthetics. I had to do them for a hand split once. I go in there and see if there's anything in there that looks like it.

M: Okay, cool. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, cool. It's really, it's really interesting to hear your kind of thought process with that.

So thanks for sharing. How about if I were to ask you, to find where you could get reimbursed for travel.

P: Hmm.

M: also known as like travel pay.

P: I do get, I do get that. So for that, I don't, I usually have to go into the VA site itself. And I actually have a shortcut or a link on my. On my main screen that will get me there, but I'm not sure. How that goes through. The healthy vet, cause normally I can't do it through health yet.

M: Hmm, okay. Yeah. So recently, I, it sounds like you maybe haven't done it just like very, very recently, Recently it was added to my healthy vet.

P: No.

M: Oh, okay.

P: Okay, so, the home option that was there and what's maintenance, messages, medications, medical records. Hey, ments, medical supplies. Oh hey, what do you know? Okay. Okay. Okay. There they are. Yeah.

M: Yeah, I thought it was the first. 3 appointments or appointments, messages, medications and. Records. So now there are options like yeah I haven't seen before. So Okay, so I see where the payments are. I like my name, travel reimbursement.

P: Oh, that link might not work because it's This is just the prototype. Okay, cool.

M: Okay, well I just clicked it. So Yeah, I'm curious to hear, you know, earlier you mentioned something about the mind healthy that main page. Would you call this? My healthevet That main page or is there something else you have in mind?

P: If in the, so at the screen I'm looking at. There's a dark blue ribbon that says Sally with the down arrow. Right under that is my healthy vet with a down arrow. I was clicked on my healthy bed.

M: Hmm, okay.

P: I thought that take me back to where I could start. But the 2 new things just aren't don't happen to be listed under that menu or The flies. And travel reimbursement. So those both were on there. That one would work, but So what I did when I couldn't find it, I just hit the home button underneath. It which brings me to the whole list, but. For this short dropdown, it would be nice because other 2 were on.

P: Yeah, totally. And, Why do you think you thought to click home? That's whenever I can't figure something out, I go, over.

M: Yeah, totally.

P: I think that was linked to like my account, my healthy bed account. So I think the phone would be like the overall healthy that. No, it I guess I don't really See the difference? I mean. If you hadn't asked how to do those 2 things I didn't know about. I probably wouldn't have gone to home. So,
Yeah, I don't think I've ever used phone before because I've always had those 4 things I could do. So.

M: Great. Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, cool. 

Alright, I'm just checking my notes to see if there's anything I missed. I have a few questions to kind of wrap up looking at this version of the site before we switch over to the second one.

P: Okay.

M: And so I just wanted to ask you to give me a rating. So on a scale of one to 5, one being easy, 5 being difficult. How would you rate the difficulty of finding what what you're looking for in this site in this version of the site.

P: I'm thinking between 3 and 4 because The menu, the dropdown menu I usually use doesn't have the The travel or the supply. So If I, if it was late in the day and. My rain fog was rolling in. Be able to figure it out. And I would probably. Get really frustrated.

M: Okay. Right, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, great. Is there anything I haven't asked you about With this. Version that you'd like to share.

P: Let me just go through. Let me see that. I know, I think. Cause I'm just going through all the other things on it. And Okay. So, you know, I can't really think of anything else that I would I would do when I go online other than those things. So. No, that. I don't think that's it.

M: Okay, great. So I'm just gonna grab the second link.

P: Okay.
