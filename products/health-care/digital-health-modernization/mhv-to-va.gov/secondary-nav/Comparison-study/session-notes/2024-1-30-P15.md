Screen sharing instructions: 

M: I just want to explain it to you briefly. So I want you to do is just kind of imagine, you know, you're receiving this email in your typical email inbox.

P: Okay.

M: So what you use Gmail or AOL or Yahoo, you're just receiving this email so you can just go ahead and read it and follow the prompt.

P: Okay.

M: And then I'm assuming you've probably seen this screen before. Okay.

P: I've I've looked at some stuff before. As far as records and things like that.

M: Okay.

P: So.

M: Great. So, yeah, you arrived on the site. I would love exactly what you're doing. Just kind of like look around on this one page before clicking anything. And I'd love to hear Claudine like, if it's at all surprising. That you landed here or if this is the type of thing you'd expect. To land on in that link.

P: No, this is something I would expect. Oh, I just. So. I could. Okay, so. Yeah. I'm looking, that what I'm doing is I'm looking at the screen saying, okay, I can't look at the results. There's no option Is that just something that . 

M: I will ask you shortly to go find them. You're totally spot on. I wanted to ask you, you know, like in in our imagination, you received the link in your email, you click that link signed in and then showed up here.

P: Okay.

M: Is that was that weird at all? Was that like the right order of events?

P: It's not weird at all. Yeah. Oh, actually, when, with my healthy vet.

M: Okay, cool.

P: With secure messaging, the the email I get at Gmail just says I have a new message from my doctor. It doesn't tell me. Any other information except to, to log in to that to check my messages. So I don't know that. The information that you sent like the link would. Show up in my Gmail. So I don't think I would be going through my Gmail. I think I'd still need to log in to the Yeah.

M: Okay, okay, awesome. Yeah, that is really helpful information and exactly what I was asking you for. Thank you. Great. And then it seems like you've mentioned this, but I just want to ask really clearly. How would you describe where you've landed?

P: It looks like I've landed in my in well. A message in my index in the secure messaging section.

M: Okay, cool. And that's you said you've used secure messaging. A good number of times. Okay. So, as you already guessed, next I want you to imagine that your, You wanna look at the images from your x-ray?

P: Yeah.

M: And I'm wondering where you would go to do that. So, and just possible, I'd love to hear your thoughts out loud.

P: Okay.

M: So tell me what you're looking for.

P: About the notification. We're getting now when there's a new secure message. There's an option to, you know, if there's an if you have a new message, will notify you via Gmail. It would be. Gmail would give a little more information. Like, cause I sometimes I go in and I'll send several messages to different doctors and when I get a response, I don't know which one it is and I have to go log in and If I knew that it was like this doctor responding or that doctor is funny, but I don't know if that,

M: Interesting. 

P: Yeah. That's just what I would, would think have you really had to know which doctor would actually respond.

M: Yeah, absolutely. That makes a lot of sense to me. Cool, very helpful comment.

P: So if you were looking for those x-ray images, I'm just curious to know what you. What you're looking for to try to find those.

M: I would go back to the, my main screen on my healthy vet and I believe of all the options.

P: There's one for test results or something of that kind of genre.

M: Okay. Okay, great. Yeah, so feel free you can kind of click around to get where you 

P: Okay. I go to medical records. That's test results. Okay, so I see that ABLE left 3 views is probably the one that the messages are going to.
