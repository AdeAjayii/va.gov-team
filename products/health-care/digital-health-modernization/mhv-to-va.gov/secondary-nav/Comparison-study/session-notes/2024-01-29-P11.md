## Background
- On desktop (mac)
- Seeing prototype A first
- Uses voice-over (thinks of herself between beginner and intermediate)

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Letâ€™s start with a few questions... 
   
1. What experience do you have with VA.gov (or the VA mobile app)?
   
P: I use VA.gov a couple times a year to access my letters. I've used it to apply to the VRE program. And I've helped other people navigate it for some things.

2. _If receive VA health care_: Do you have experience with My HealtheVet? _If participant isn't familiar, don't help them remember, just move on_

P: I'm on it almost every week. Checking my results, finding out you know what the notes are from the dfoctors, sending emails, um, you know, asking for appointments or you know work done because I know I don't have to go there to get paperwork signed I can upload everything for the doctors, so. 

## Tasks for Prototype 1 

### Task 0: Messages - 5 mins 

Skips the first couple screens and prototype starts on the x-ray results SM screen. 

M: Now that you're landed on this page, take a second and familiarize yourself with this page and I'm just curious if you can tell me a bit about where you landed.
P: I landed on an open email inside of hte message inside of My HealtheVet.

M: How do you know you're inside My HealtheVet?
P: Because it has messages and it's from my doctor and they'll only send messages through My HealtheVet, secure messaging. I think I remember something in there about My HealtheVet towards the top. You gotta understand I was a visual person my whole life and I'm still transitioning to learning through hearing. 

M: Where would you start looking first for your x-rays and report?
_P then turned on inverted colors (switched to black and white_
P:  I would go to the blue button message and then I'd probably customize my date range. And depending on how tired I am, I'd look at all results. 
M: Can you go ahead and click around to complete that task for viewing the xray and report? 
P: Um, okay. Well the message is a little confusing to me because it says look at your lab and test results and it's like, waht the hell do you mean look at them? Ususally the doctor emails me my results and says we didn't find anyhitn significant. Like my breast MRI and mammogram, they say we found no significant things, and I don't have to look because they send me a message about this. So they don't tell me to look at my imaging. 
M: Let's say you wanted to.
P: Okay, I'd navigate back up to the top. _Clicks medical records in nav bar_



### Task 1: Find x-ray - 15 mins

### Prototype 1 closing questions - 2 minutes
We're going to switch over to looking at the other version of the same site. Before we do that:
- Are these types of tasks things you've done before? Tell me more.
- I noticed that you clicked / didn't click "menu" at the top right. What would you guess that is for? If you did click it, what would you expect to see?
- How about the button or area labeled "Sally"?
- On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding what you were looking for in that site we just explored together?
    - Why that rating? 
- Anything you'd like to share that I haven't asked you about?

## Interview closing questions - 5 minutes

Thank you for your patience and for going through those tasks again using this second version of the site. You can close out the web browser and stop sharing your screen. I just have a few final questions to ask you:

- Now that you've seen both of these approaches to managing your healthcare - what are your thoughts about them?
- Did you find one version easier than another to use? Why? What about it?
- If you were talking to a friend that is also a Veteran and wanted to explain to them how to find this site on the web, what would you say?
- If you were talking to a friend that is also a Veteran who wanted to use these tools, how would you describe the relationship between this site and the VA.gov?
- Anything I didn't ask you about that you want to share about your experience?
