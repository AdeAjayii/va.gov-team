Great, now I can see your screen! 

Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.  Now let's go to that website. I can post the URL in the chat or just say it to you. Which of you prefer? 

#### Open prototype
- Thanks for your patience in figuring that out together. In a moment I'll share a link with you in the Zoom chat. Just a reminder: the link will open what appears to be a webpage but it's actually just a prototype (aka a fake website). It might not behave exactly as you'd expect a webpage to behave, and you won't see your name or your own personal information. Okay I'm sending the link now. Go ahead and copy and paste the link in your browser.

## Tasks for Prototype 1 

### Task 0: Messages - 5 mins 

Okay looks like you have the prototype open. I want you to start by imagining that you just received this email. Go ahead and read the email text and follow the prompt.

P: Do I mean a view message?

M: Yeah, go for it.

P: I actually wouldn't click on this because it looks fake so I would not cause my physician I mean they can call me I or I will call them and say I don't think I would ever click on this but for me to click on this.

M: know it's safe in this case. But that's a really good instinct 

P: Yes, yes, too many. Yes, too many logins. Makes you go to this id me, or just log in Gov, and then id.me sucks. So I, yeah.

M: yeah, I know I'm sorry. It's frustrating. We're trying to work it out. There's a few teams working on it, but I know it's so frustrating so you can go ahead and just click any of these buttons. And it's just kind of simulating a log on process. So this isn't a we, a real website. It just looks kind of like a website. So it's just gonna act a little different.

M: So yeah, I want you to do what you're doing. Look around and tell me if this is kind of what you'd expect clicking on that link and landing here.

P: Yeah, I'm on X ray result. So yeah.I would expect it to be kind of short. And what's the word general. They wouldn't be too specific. But yeah. They'd probably tell you to contact them. Because who knows who's looking at this? Yeah.

M: And then I just want, I'm I'm just curious how you would describe this website you landed on from your email.

P: What do you mean describe it?

M: So what is this website? What is it for getting? 

P: Well, This looks like it's my test results, medical results. So I'm guessing. Here you can go labs X-rays, you know. So like a place to see your labs and X-rays and maybe other health stuff, I guess that's correct


### Task 1: Find x-ray - 15 mins
_Medical records > Lab and test results > locate x-ray result for scan of left ankle_

M: great. so I'm gonna give you a task. That I'd love to see if you can try to find where you would go to look at your images from your X-ray. If you wanted to go like, read the report.  and before you click on anything, I just like to hear what you're looking for. So just think out loud.

P: Well. I guess I'd have to go back to the inbox.

M: sorry some some things aren't aren't gonna work, but it's really helpful to know that that would be. The instinct is to go back to the inbox.

P: I don't see on here where I could see the X-ray says, back to what is this back to top? Because, yeah, I'm not moving it. I'm not printing it. I'm not trashing it. So I don't see where I would be able to actually, see maybe medical records

P:   your lab and test results, vaccines allergies.

M: And what are you looking for? 

P: Here is like, is there like a X-rays, like a specific word, or something just like X-ray, It says, Lab and test results. So here we go here. lab and test results. Radiology images. Okay, Great.

M: Yeah. And it sounded like you. You were looking for the word X-ray. But it's not actually in the in that text there. So I'm curious, kind of like what indicated to you to click there lab and test results. 

P: I wouldn't necessarily know that X-ray would be included in that list, the black and test results. But sounds like okay.

M: cool great, that's helpful.

### Task 2: Make appointment - 5 mins
_Labs and tests result > Appointments_

M: so I'm gonna give you another task. For the next one, i want you to imagine that you want to make a follow up appointment with your doctor. and I want you to just show me where you would go to do that.

P: Let's see here. Well, I guess appointments. And what, doctor am I trying to make an appointment with?

M: yeah, that same doctor. 

P: So radiology, Doctor Smith, is that radiology? It's not clicking. Well, I guess I'd have to go start scheduling.

M: Yeah, cool. And and that's as far as the task goes. Actually. so I don't want to make you keep keep looking and looking when you already found it. Yeah, that's exactly


#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Does participant seem more/less confident than last task?
- Desktop: Do they see the Appointments link right away? Or does it take time? / Mobile: Do they go right to the dropdown nav this time?
- Does the participant "start over" or "reset"? Where do they go to do that?
- Back button used?
- Breadcrumbs used?
- Mobile: If user did not know abbreviations, does that seem to cause obstacles?

### Task 3: Order CPAP supplies from VA - 5 mins 
_Home > Order CPAP supplies_

- The next task is the final one to complete with this version of the site. Please imagine you need to order CPAP supplies to help you breathe when you are sleeping. Where would you go to order those supplies?
- _If participant struggles, watch and wait_: Now that you've explored ____ a little bit, what do you think it's for?

- _Once arrived on CPAP supplies page_: How did you know to go there? What did you expect to find?
- Are you still on the same site you started on? How do you know?

#### Things to note (desktop and mobile)
- Does participant seem more/less confident than last task?
- Do they look to the secondary nav right away this time?
- What else does the participant click on or hover over before clicking on the "correct" link?
- Does the participant "start over" or "reset"? Where do they go to do that?
- Back button used?
- Breadcrumbs used?
- Mobile: If user did not know abbreviations, does that seem to cause obstacles?

### Prototype 1 closing questions - 2 minutes
We're going to switch over to looking at the other version of the same site. Before we do that:
- Are these types of tasks things you've done before? Tell me more.
- I noticed that you clicked / didn't click "menu" at the top right. What would you guess that is for? If you did click it, what would you expect to see?
- How about the button or area labeled "Sally"?
- On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding what you were looking for in that site we just explored together?
    - Why that rating? 
- Anything you'd like to share that I haven't asked you about?

## Interview closing questions - 5 minutes

Thank you for your patience and for going through those tasks again using this second version of the site. You can close out the web browser and stop sharing your screen. I just have a few final questions to ask you:

- Now that you've seen both of these approaches to managing your healthcare - what are your thoughts about them?
- Did you find one version easier than another to use? Why? What about it?
- If you were talking to a friend that is also a Veteran and wanted to explain to them how to find this site on the web, what would you say?
- If you were talking to a friend that is also a Veteran who wanted to use these tools, how would you describe the relationship between this site and the VA.gov?
- Anything I didn't ask you about that you want to share about your experience?
