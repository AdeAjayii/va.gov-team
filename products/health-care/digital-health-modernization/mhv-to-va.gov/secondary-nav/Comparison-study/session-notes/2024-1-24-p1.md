## Tasks for Prototype 1 

### Task 0: Messages - 5 mins 

Okay looks like you have the prototype open. I want you to start by imagining that you just received this email. Go ahead and read the email text.

_Once the participant is done reading_: What would you do next? Go ahead and do that.

_Participant arrives on secure messaging page with message from doctor open_

-  Before you click on anything, how would you describe where you are on this site? 
   - How do you know? 
-  What if anything is surprising about landing here on this page?


### Task 1: Find x-ray - 15 mins
_Medical records > Lab and test results > locate x-ray result for scan of left ankle_

- Let's move slowly on this next task; the next thing I'm going to ask you to do is imagine that you want to look at the images and read the report from your x-rays.

- Before you click anything, I want to hear where you might naturally start looking first? 

- And what are you looking for?

- Why focus on this ________ (secondary or primary nav) and not the other?

- Let's talk more in detail about this area (the secondary nav):
  
   - Could you walk me through each of the links laid out here?
     
   - Where would you expect to be taken if you clicked that link?
     
   - What if anything about finding your way around here seems confusing?

- Okay, now go ahead and click around as needed to complete the task of viewing your x-ray images and report. _Guide as needed._

- _Once participant arrives_: On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding your x-ray results?
   - Why do you give that rating?

    
- Now that you see where to find your x-rays on this site, what are your thoughts about where it's located on this site??
   - Where would you put it?
 
     
- If you were on the phone with a friend who is also a Veteran and is looking for this site, how would you explain how to get to this site?

### Task 2: Make appointment - 5 mins
_Labs and tests result > Appointments_

- For the next task, imagine that you want to make a follow-up appointment with your doctor. Show me how you'd do that using this website.
  
- I'm seeing you gravitate towards ______. Why are you going there first?
  
- What are you looking for?
- _Once participant arrives on Appointments_: On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding where you might schedule an appointment?
   - Why do you give that rating?

     
- Now that you see where to schedule an appointment on this site, does its location make sense?
   - Where would it make more sense?


### Task 3: Order CPAP supplies from VA - 5 mins 
_Home > Order CPAP supplies_

- The next task is the final one to complete with this version of the site. Please imagine you need to order CPAP supplies to help you breathe when you are sleeping. Where would you go to order those supplies? 
_Once arrived on CPAP supplies page_
   - _If participant clicked link to get "home": _What did you expect to see when you clicked "My HealtheVet" or "home"?

   - On a scale of 1-5, 1 = easy and 5 = difficult, how would you rate the difficulty of finding where to order medical supplies?
   - Why do you give that rating?
     
- Now that you see where to order supplies on this site, does its location make sense?
   - Where would it make more sense?

## Tasks for Prototype 2
