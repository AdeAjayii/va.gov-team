# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov secondary navigation comparison research, January/February 2024

## Background
Findings from [recent wayfinding research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2023-10-MHV-secondary-navigation-research) on the MHV portal imply the following:
1. MHV users will benefit from navigation that allows them to move between tools;
2. MHV users struggle to notice and make use of secondary navigation when it is condensed into a dropdown.

This study aims to give us a sense of what type of between-tool navigation will be most intuitive for users to notice, access, and make use of when completing health management tasks on mobile and desktop devices.

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online.
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information.
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features.

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	
The purpose of this research is to assess and compare participants' ability to navigate the health portal using two distinct navigation concepts, both on mobile and desktop (total of 4 designs in all). 

### Outcome
This research will inform us on how Veterans use different navigation designs to complete health management tasks and will provide direction on the next iteration of secondary navigation on the My HealtheVet portal. 

### Research questions
* How does the current VA.gov secondary navigational pattern align with Veterans’ expectations for MHV on VA.gov? 
* In what situations might a Veteran want to navigate back to the MHV on the VA.gov landing page, if they want to go back to the landing page? 
* In what situations might a Veteran want to jump directly from one tool to another? 

### Hypotheses 

* Users want to be able to navigate every part of MHV on VA.gov easily regardless of where they are.
* Mobile users will likely struggle with current secondary navigation because "in this section" is not noticeable.
* Users might have trouble differentiating the primary menu from the secondary menu.
* Users might want to click on "VA.gov" home when they want to get back to the MHV landing page because the MHV landing page link is hidden.
* Users might only rely on secondary (section) navigation and overlook breadcrumbs and direct links on the pages that take them to other tools. 

## Method

### Interviews
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. These interviews will include questions documenting users’ process of navigating to and within My HealtheVet, the mental models they use to find certain information, and their expectations related to health-specific tasks. The interviews will consist of a combination of tasks and direct questions. 

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom.
