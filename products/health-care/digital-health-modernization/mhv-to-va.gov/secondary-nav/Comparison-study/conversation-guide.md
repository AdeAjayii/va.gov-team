## Interview Script

### Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is _____ and _____ is taking notes.

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double check with you before we get going. 

**Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**

   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

We've invited you here today to help us improve a website for Veterans. We'll explore two different ideas for the site together; I'm looking forward to watching you experience the two concepts and hearing your opinions and thoughts. Before we jump in with prompts and questions, I first have some information to share about our time together.

**For screenreader or mobile sessions:** Before we start, I want to confirm a few pieces of information that were shared with me when you signed up for the study:

- **For screenreader sessions:** I understand you use screenreader software to navigate the internet, and that you typically use SOFTWARE NAME.  Are you able to use that during our session today?
- That sounds good, thank you.

- **For mobile sessions:** I understand you use your smartphone primarily to access VA.gov. Can you confirm that you are on your phone now? 

Thank you for confirming these things! Now, I have a few things about today I want to go over with you before we get started. 

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know. 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **I’m also going to make sure transcriptions are turned on to improve our notes.**

_Turn on transcription._

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. What types of VA benefits if any do you currently receive?

      a. Have you received other benefits in the past?

      b. If yes, which?
   
3. Do you ever login to VA.gov or the VA mobile app?

      a. Frequency (How often do you login?) 
      b. For what purpose?
   
4. Do you ever login to MHV?
   
      a. Frequency (How often do you login?) 
      b. For what purpose? 
   
**Screen sharing instructions - 5-10 minutes**

Thanks for answering those questions. I want to transition us to exploring the different sites together. First I want you to share your screen. Is that something you've done before?

_Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:_
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

_Instructions for folks using screenreaders on a desktop:_
- Hit Alt S (as in Same); the option should come up to select the window you want to share - please choose Basic. 
- Tab over and confirm that what is selected is "entire screen." 
- Tab once more - make sure "share sound" is checked. 
- Tab 4 times over to "share screen" - click activate. 

Great, now I can see your screen! 

Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.  Now let's go to that website. I can post the URL in the chat or just say it to you. Which of you prefer? 

_Open prototype_
- Thanks for your patience in figuring that out together. In a moment I'll share a link with you in the Zoom chat. Just a reminder: the link will open what appears to be a webpage but it's actually just a prototype (aka a fake website). It might not behave exactly as you'd expect a webpage to behave, and you won't see your name or your own personal information. Okay I'm sending the link now. Go ahead and copy and paste the link in your browser.

- _Send them or say CodePen prototype_

  - Design A: https://codepen.io/figaro/project/live/dec27c9852d5bc105e841a3d0bc989ff
  - Design B: https://codepen.io/figaro/project/live/63418c9f42aaf22d4c8198d968ce91cf


## Tasks for Prototype 1 

### Task 0: Messages - 5 mins 

Okay looks like you have the prototype open. I want you to start by imagining that you just received this email from your physician, if you wanted to read that secure message, can you show me how you would  do that? 

_Participant arrives on secure messaging page with message from doctor open_

1. Tell me about what you are seeing here.
2. Where does it look like you are right now? How do you know/why do you think that? 
3. Is this what you expect? How so (or why not)?
4. Let's say you want to check out the images and radiology report from your x-ray. 

### Things to note 
- Is it clear that the participant arrived in the health portal?  
- Any struggles or confusion?


### Task 1: Medical records > Lab and test results > locate x-ray result for scan of left ankle - 10 minutes 

5. What would you do next to try and find the x-ray results of your left ankle?
  - It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking.

_Pay attention to where the participant clicks first and ask _

- Why did you click there, and what do you expect to find there?
- Thinking about this task - is this something you’ve done before - looked up an x-ray result on a VA site? tell me about that.

_Optional probes_very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_

- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): There are limits to this prototype, and you won't be able to actually type in a search query here, but can you tell me what information you were hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think would happen if you (_do something_)?
- (_If participant gets stuck because they navigate to a spot where they will be unable to find the medical records or lab results_) It looks like you're not finding the x-ray results you are looking for. What would you do at this point? (_If participant says they would call or use resources outside of VA.gov, ask them again what they would do using only this website._)
- (_If participant is completely stuck and/or getting frustrated_) I'm sorry this has been so confusing, though it's helpful to see that we're maybe not doing a good enough job helping Veterans to find this information. Would you mind (_clicking on Medical Records in that blue bar at the top of the page_)?
- (_If participant still cannot find it, direct them to it and continue with the interview._)

### Things to note 
- How does the participant attempt to navigate to the images and radiology report? 
- Any struggles or confusion?

### Task 2: Labs and tests result > Appointments - 10 mins 

Great. Thanks for talking that through with me. Let's say you want to make a follow-up appointment with your doctor. Can you show me how you would do that? 
- Again, it's super helpful if you can think aloud as you show me. 

_Pay attention to where the participant clicks first and ask _

- Why did you click there, and what do you expect to find there?
- Thinking about this task - is this something you’ve done before - looked up an x-ray result on a VA site? tell me about that.

### Things to note 
- How does the participant attempt to navigate to schedule an appointment?  
- Any struggles or confusion?

### Task 3: Order CPAP supplies from VA - 10 mins 

Great. Let's say you successfully scheduled your appointment. And let's pretend you wanted to order a CPAP machine that helps with your breathing. Can you show me how you would do that?

## Post-tasks interview questions - 5 minutes

- Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you’d like to share about what we just went through?

## Tasks for Prototype 2 

In a moment I'll share another link with you in the Zoom chat. Just a reminder: the link will open what appears to be a webpage but it's actually just a prototype (like the one we just went through). It might not behave exactly as you'd expect a webpage to behave, and you won't see your name or your own personal information. Okay I'm sending the link now. Go ahead and copy and paste the link in your browser. 

I am going to ask you similar questions as last time. Let's as you arrived on this page from an email (drop participant at x-ray results page)

### Post-task interview questions - 5 minutes
- Sone kind of comparison questions 
- Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you’d like to share?
- Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?



**OVERALL Qs**
- If participant clicks on the mega menu during any task, don't let them go further, but ask:
   - What do you expect to find there?
   - What do you think the differences are between the main and secondary menus (pointing them out)?
- Overall, how would you rate the experience of completing various health-related tasks? 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, and why? (if they have a hard time recalling, ask them to go back to the prototype and point out where).
- (_Ask participant to go back to Lab and test results_) Open the section navigation and ask
     - Then can you go back to the medical records page, and open the section navigation
     - Now that you have looked at both, can you explain the differences?
     - How would it have helped if you used it earlier, if at all?


## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

**I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
- _If the participant says yes:_ Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want to be shared in a video clip? 

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
