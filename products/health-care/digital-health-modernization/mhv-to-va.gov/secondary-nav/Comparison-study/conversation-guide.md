## Interview Script
### Intro - 5-10 minutes
Thank you for joining us today! My name is _____ and _____ is taking notes.

We've invited you here today to help us improve a website for Veterans. We'll explore two different ideas for the site together; I'm looking forward to watching you experience the two concepts and hearing your opinions and thoughts. Before we jump in with prompts and questions, I first have some information to share about our time together.

- We'll spend about 60 mins together, but do our best not to go over
- I'll be asking you plenty of questions, but have no expectations or hopes for how you answer. Everything you do and say will help us learn what will work best for Veterans like you. There are no right or wrong ways to complete the tasks I'll be asking you to complete, and no right or wrong answers to my questions.
- Your participation in this session can be ended at any time. If you'd like to end the call, you are entirely free to do so.
- Any questions I can answer for you at this point?
- Okay, I have a few colleagues waiting to join our call who would like to sit in and listen to our conversation. Do you feel comfortable with a few more people joining us? _If yes, admit those in the waiting room. Ask them to introduce themselves.__
- We're almost ready to get started, I just need to ask your permission to do two more things. First, are you okay with me recording our conversation so I can listen to it later if I forget something? _Once you hit record, ask again._
- And lastly, I'd also like to ask your permission to share small clips from the recording with other individuals who work on the website. These clips would only be shared internally and we would remove identifying information to protect your anonymity. Would this be okay with you?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. What types of VA benefits if any do you currently receive?
   a. Have you received other benefits in the past? If yes, which?
2. Do you ever login to VA.gov or the VA mobile app?
   a. Frequency?
   b. For what purpose?
3. Do you ever login to MHV?
   a. Frequency?
   b. For what purpose? 
   
**Screen sharing instructions - 5-15 minutes**

Thanks for answering those questions. I want to transition us to exploring the different sites together. First I want you to share your screen. Is that something you've done before?

_Participants without screen reader:_
- Find the zoom screen; this is a row of buttons at the bottom.
- In the center of that row is a green button that says "Share" (if viewing on phone), "Share screen" (if on computer), or "Broadcast screen" (on iPad).
- You'll then be given options for what to share. Please choose "screen" (for phone), or your web browser (for computer)

_Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:_
- I'm going to share my screen and give you control of it. Does that sound okay?
- Can you confirm if you can see my screen?
- _Give mouse control)_ Now try to move your mouse around on my screen.

_Open prototype_
- Thanks for your patience in figuring that out together. In a moment I'll share a link with you in the zoom chat. Just a reminder: the link will open what appears to be a webpage but it's actually just a prototype (aka a fake website). It might not behave exactly as you'd expect a webpage to behave, and you won't see your name or your own personal information. Okay I'm sending the link now. Go ahead and copy and paste the link in your browser. 
 
## Tasks for Prototype 1 (x min)
Okay looks like you have the prototype open. I want you to start by imagining that you just received this email. Go ahead and read the email text and follow the prompt.

_Participant arrives on secure messaging page with message from doctor open_

### Task 0: Messages

1. Where does it look like you've arrived?
2. Does this align with what you would expect? How so (or why not)?
3. Now go ahead and read this message. Explain to me the meaning as you understand it.
4. Let's say you did want to check out the images and radiology report from your xray. 

### Task 1: Medical records > Lab and test results > locate x-ray result for scan of left ankle

5. What would you do next to try and find the x-ray results of your left ankle?
  - It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking. 

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): There are limits to this prototype, and you won't be able to actually type in a search query here, but can you tell me what information you were hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think would happen if you (_do something_)?
- (_If participant gets stuck because they navigate to a spot where they will be unable to find the medical records or lab results_) It looks like you're not finding the x-ray results you are looking for. What would you do at this point? (_If participant says they would call or use resources outside of VA.gov, ask them again what they would do using only this website._)
- (_If participant is completely stuck and/or getting frustrated_) I'm sorry this has been so confusing, though it's helpful to see that we're maybe not doing a good enough job helping Veterans to find this information. Would you mind (_clicking on Medical Records in that blue bar at the top of the page_)?
- (_If participant still cannot find it, direct them to it and continue with the interview._)

### Task 2: 


**So, today you are going to perform some healthcare-related activities with this prototype. I will be giving you a couple of healthcare-related activities, and please use this prototype to walk me through how you'd complete the activities.** 

**(Start from the signed-in MHV landing page) Before I give you the task, talk me through what you are seeing on the screen - where does it make you think you are on the site?**

**_Task 1a - MR and SM_** Imagine that you were recently put on blood thinner medication. Your doctor ordered blood tests two weeks after you started the medication to make sure that it is working. How would you go about seeing those results? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking. 

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term. What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)?
- (_If participant gets stuck because they navigate to a spot where they will be unable to find the medical records or lab results_) It looks like you're not finding the information around what was decided for the next steps in your care. What would you do at this point? (_If participant says they would call or use resources outside of VA.gov, ask them again what they would do using only this website._)
- (_If participant is completely stuck and/or getting frustrated_) I'm sorry this has been so confusing, though it's helpful to see that we're maybe not doing a good enough job helping Veterans to find this information. Would you mind (_clicking on the second menu_)?
- (_If participant still cannot find it, direct them to it and continue with the interview._)
- (_If participant is too fast or you didn't see where they tabbed_) I can’t see where you tab on the screen, can you let me know where you tabbed? 

**Must ask:**
- (_Pay attention to_) Where does participant click first, and ask why?
- (_If participant clicks on mega menu_) Why did you click there, and what do you expect to find there?
- (_If participant didn't click on secondary nav._) Did you see it? If so, why didn't you click it, and what would you expect if you clicked?
- (_If participant felt stuck) Where do you expect to find it? Why? 
- What are your thoughts about the amount of time it took you to find the blood result?
- Thinking about this task - is this something you’ve done before - looked up a test result on a va site? tell me about that.

**After participant finishes the task:**
- Thinking about this task - Is this something you’d normally do for managing your health? Tell me more about that.
- What was helpful, and what wasn’t? Why?
- What did you like, and didn’t? Why?
- (_If there’s a pattern, ask this question. If not, ask after all tasks_) I see you used ___(e.g. "in this section" menu, or breadcrumbs, or trying to go to MHV landing page) a lot, tell me more about why you did that?


**_Task 1b - MR and SM_** hen, say you're not sure what the results mean because of the medical terminologies and you want to ask your doctor about it. Using the resources offered on this website, how would you go about doing that? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking

- Why did you (_do that, go there, try that_)? 
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)?
- (_If participant is too fast or you didn't see where they tabbed_) I can’t see where you tab on the screen, can you let me know where you tabbed?

**OVERALL Qs**
- If participant clicks on the mega menu during any task, don't let them go further, but ask:
   - What do you expect to find there?
   - What do you think the differences are between the main and secondary menus (pointing them out)?
- Overall, how would you rate the experience of completing various health-related tasks? 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, and why? (if they have a hard time recalling, ask them to go back to the prototype and point out where).
- (_Ask participant to go back to Lab and test results_) Open the section navigation and ask
     - Then can you go back to the medical records page, and open the section navigation
     - Now that you have looked at both, can you explain the differences?
     - How would it have helped if you used it earlier, if at all?


## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

**I want to circle back and re-confirm with you that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners.** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing, and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
- _If the participant says yes:_ Is there any part of our discussion that you would NOT want to be shared in a video clip? 

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
