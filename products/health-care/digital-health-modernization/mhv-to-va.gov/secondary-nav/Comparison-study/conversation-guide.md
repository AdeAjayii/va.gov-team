## Interview Script

### Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is _____ and _____ is taking notes.

We've invited you here today to help us improve a website for Veterans. We'll use our time today to explore two different ideas for the site together.  Before we jump in with prompts and questions, I first have some information to confirm with you:

**For screenreader or mobile sessions:** Before we start, I want to confirm a few pieces of information with you:
- **For screenreader sessions:** I understand you use screenreader software to navigate the internet, and that you typically use SOFTWARE NAME.  Are you able to use that during our session today?
- **For mobile sessions:** I understand you primarily use your phone to access the internet. Can you confirm that you are on your phone now? 

Thank you for confirming these things! Now, I have a few things about today I want to go over with you before we get started:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know.

- I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double check with you before we get going. 

- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**

   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **I’m also going to make sure transcriptions are turned on to improve our notes.**

_Turn on transcription._

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. What types of VA benefits if any do you currently receive?
      a. Have you received other benefits in the past?
      b. If yes, which?
   
2. Do you ever login to VA.gov or the VA mobile app?
      a. Frequency (How often do you login?) 
      b. For what purpose?
   
3. (If receive VA health care): Do you ever login to MHV?
      a. Frequency (How often do you login?) 
      b. For what purpose? 
   
**Screen sharing instructions - 5-10 minutes**

Thanks for answering those questions. I want to transition us to exploring the different sites together. First I want you to share your screen. Is that something you've done before?

_Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:_
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

_Instructions for folks using screenreaders on a desktop:_
- Hit Alt S (as in Same); the option should come up to select the window you want to share - please choose Basic. 
- Tab over and confirm that what is selected is "entire screen." 
- Tab once more - make sure "share sound" is checked. 
- Tab 4 times over to "share screen" - click activate. 

Great, now I can see your screen! 

Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.  Now let's go to that website. I can post the URL in the chat or just say it to you. Which of you prefer? 

_Open prototype_
- Thanks for your patience in figuring that out together. In a moment I'll share a link with you in the Zoom chat. Just a reminder: the link will open what appears to be a webpage but it's actually just a prototype (aka a fake website). It might not behave exactly as you'd expect a webpage to behave, and you won't see your name or your own personal information. Okay I'm sending the link now. Go ahead and copy and paste the link in your browser.

- _Send them or say CodePen prototype_

  - Design A: https://codepen.io/figaro/project/live/dec27c9852d5bc105e841a3d0bc989ff
  - Design B: https://codepen.io/figaro/project/live/63418c9f42aaf22d4c8198d968ce91cf


## Tasks for Prototype 1 

### Task 0: Messages - 5 mins 

Okay looks like you have the prototype open. I want you to start by imagining that you just received this email from your physician, if you wanted to read that secure message, can you show me how you would do that? 

_Participant arrives on secure messaging page with message from doctor open_

-  Tell me about what you are seeing here.
-  How would you explain where you are right now?
-  Let's say you want to check out the images and radiology report from your x-ray. Where would you start to look to find that?
     - It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking.

### Things to note 
- Is it clear that the participant arrived in the health portal?  
- Any struggles or confusion?


### Task 1: Find xray (Medical records > Lab and test results > locate x-ray result for scan of left ankle) - 10 minutes 

5. Where would you start to look to find that?
  - It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking.

_Pay attention to where the participant clicks first and potential questions_

- Why did you click there, and what do you expect to find there?
- _If using secondary nav_ How do you know/why are using it? 

_Once participant arrives on Labs and tests result page_ 

- What, if anything, was challenging with getting here?

_Optional probes_very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_

- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): There are limits to this prototype, and you won't be able to actually type in a search here, but can you tell me what information you were hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think would happen if you (_do something_)?
- (_If participant gets stuck because they navigate to a spot where they will be unable to find the medical records or lab results_) It looks like you're not finding the x-ray results you are looking for. What would you do at this point? (_If participant says they would call or use resources outside of VA.gov, ask them again what they would do using only this website._)
- (_If participant is completely stuck and/or getting frustrated_) I'm sorry this has been so confusing, though it's helpful to see that we're maybe not doing a good enough job helping Veterans to find this information. Would you mind (_clicking on Medical Records in that blue bar at the top of the page_)?
- (_If participant still cannot find it, direct them to it and continue with the interview._)

### Things to note 
- How does the participant attempt to navigate to the images and radiology report?
- Did the participant notice/use the secondary nav?
- Any struggles or confusion?

### Task 2: Make appointment (Labs and tests result > Appointments) - 10 mins 

Great. Thanks for talking that through with me. Let's say you want to make a follow-up appointment with your doctor. Can you show me where you would do that? 
- Again, it's super helpful if you can think aloud as you show me. 

_Pay attention to where the participant clicks first and ask _

- Why did you click there, and what do you expect to find there?
- _If using secondary nav_ How do you know/why are using it? 

_Once arrived on Appointments_ 

- What, if anything, was challenging with getting here?
   - Why/tell me more
  
### Things to note 
- How does the participant attempt to navigate to schedule an appointment?
- Did the participant notice the secondary nav?
- Did the participant notice the "start scheduling" action link
- Any struggles or confusion?

### Task 3: Order CPAP supplies from VA - 10 mins 

Great. Let's say you successfully scheduled your appointment. And let's pretend you wanted to order CPAP supplies to help with your breathing. Can you show me how you would do that? 

_Pay attention to where the participant clicks first and ask _

- Why did you click there, and what do you expect to find there?

_Once arrived on CPAP supplies page_ 

- Is this what you expect? How so (or why not)?
- Where does it look like you are right now on VA.gov? How do you know/why do you think that?
- Thinking about this task - is this something you’ve done before - looked up an x-ray result on a VA site? Can you tell me about that?

_Optional probes_very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_

- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): There are limits to this prototype, and you won't be able to actually type in a search query here, but can you tell me what information you were hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think would happen if you (_do something_)?
- (_If participant gets stuck because they navigate to a spot where they will be unable to find the medical records or lab results_) It looks like you're not finding the x-ray results you are looking for. What would you do at this point? (_If participant says they would call or use resources outside of VA.gov, ask them again what they would do using only this website._)

Would you mind (_clicking on Medical Records in that blue bar at the top of the page_)?
- (_If participant still cannot find it, direct them to it and continue with the interview._)

### Things to note 
- How does the participant attempt to navigate to CPAP supplies?
- Did the participant notice the secondary nav?
- How did the participant understand "home" or "My Healthevet"? 
- Any struggles or confusion?

## Post-tasks interview questions - 5 minutes

- Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you’d like to share about what we just went through?

## Tasks for Prototype 2 

In a moment I'll share another link with you in the Zoom chat. Just a reminder: the link will open what appears to be a webpage but it's actually just a prototype (like the one we just went through). It might not behave exactly as you'd expect a webpage to behave, and you won't see your name or your own personal information. Okay I'm sending the link now.
