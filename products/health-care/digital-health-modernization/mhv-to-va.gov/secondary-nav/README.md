# Product Outline: Secondary Navigation for MHV-on-VA.gov

## Outcome Summary
> *Brief statement describing opportunity you're pursuing e.g. "Increase Use of Search Tools on VA.gov." Include measurable outcome (i.e. metric) you're trying to affect.*
* Improve Veterans' understanding that health tools are available within MHV-on-VAgov, so that they are less likely to look for health care-related tools in unauthenticated areas of VAgov (e.g. the megamenu).

## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?

Research has shown two important things about how Veterans use health care tools (eg secure messaging):
1. Veterans are very used to the MHV National Portal and have found ways to navigate it
2. Veterans tend to lose their way when completing tasks within MHV-on-VAgov, straying into unauthenticated areas of VAgov and getting lost.

By the end of Q3, 2024, millions of Veterans will be trying to use the new health care tools on VAgov because the National Portal is being sunsetted. We need to design a more coherent experience for the MHV tools, so that Veterans are able to stay within MHV tools if they want. (But they can still benefit from integration with the rest of VAgov if they choose to.)

Our solution is being called a "Secondary Nav" â€“Â secondary to the primary navigation of the header/mega-menu.

## Desired User Outcomes

- Users are able to easily find their way among health tools to complete tasks (eg., message a provider, schedule an appointment)
- Users are able to easily access other experiences on VAgov if they want them
- Users understand that they need to get back to the MHV-on-VAgov area if they want to use health tools

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Users look for health care tasks in the mega-menu
- Users go to unauthenticated areas of VAgov without realizing it


## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

- Fewer Veterans "reject" MHV-on-VAgov (opt out while they still have that option)
- Support load is minimized across transition from MHV national portals (MHV and Oracle) to VAgov â€“Â e.g., call center
- Providers feel transition is sustainable
