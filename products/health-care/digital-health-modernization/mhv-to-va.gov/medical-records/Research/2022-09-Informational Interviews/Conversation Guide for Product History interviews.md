### Starting the session

- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro:



## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. We are designers for the My HeatheVet on VA.gov team at VA OCTO.
I also have a couple other colleagues who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with a couple additional observers during this session?

- If participant does not consent, use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
- If participant consents, admit observers. 
   - Ask notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

Today we’re going to talk about Medical Records, specifically the Medical Records functionality within MyHealtheVet. I’m going to ask you a series of questions to help my team understand foundational information about Medical Records and how that might affect the user experience.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

- Is there any data that isn’t currently part of Medical Records that you think should be?
- Today, Appointments and Pharmacy are separate sections in MHV. Why aren’t they part of Medical Records? 
- Where do you think that the vaccine records should reside in the tool. Should they be in a separate section, or included in the medical records?
- Can you give us some information about After-Visit Summaries? Why haven’t they been included in MHV up to this point?

- Why do these two sections exist separately?
- Is the superset of data available for the Blue Button report different than the superset of data available for the VA Health Summary?
- Let’s imagine that I’m a user of MHV. If I consult the same piece of data in the Blue Button Report and in the VA Health Summary, is there any chance that that data could be different? 
- When would I use Blue Button instead of VA Health Summary? When would I use VA Health Summary instead of Blue Button?
- In previous research, the term Blue Button either is hard to understand or doesn’t mean anything to many users. Is there any reason to not change or remove the term Blue Button?

## Sixth Task: Medical Records Vision - X minutes

- The current vision for MHV can be applied to Medical Records. It states that: We aim to reduce the number of websites, products, and interfaces Veterans must use in order to get health care and manage their health — and we aim to make those experiences easy and intuitive. In a single place on VA.gov, Veterans will be able to manage all interactions with VA related to health, plus learn about health conditions and health news. Interactions that cross VA.gov, the VA.gov flagship mobile app, email, text messages, and VA facilities will be seamless.
- What would you add to the vision specific to Medical Records?
