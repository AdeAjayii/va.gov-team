### Day of the session
- Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).



### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro:



## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. We are designers for the My HeatheVet on VA.gov team at VA OCTO.
I also have a couple other colleagues who would like to observe and take notes. Are you okay with a couple additional observers during this session?

- If participant does not consent, use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
- If participant consents, admit observers. 
   - Ask notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth.

Today we’re going to talk about Medical Records, specifically the Medical Records functionality within MyHealtheVet. I’m going to ask you a series of questions to help my team understand technical information about Medical Records and how that might affect the user experience.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## First Task: General - X minutes

- When we say medical records, what does that mean to you? 
- What information is included in medical records?

## Fourth Task: Differences between Blue Button and Health Summary - X minutes

- Is there any data that isn’t currently part of Medical Records that you think should be?
- Today, Appointments and Pharmacy are separate sections in MHV. Why aren’t they part of Medical Records? 
- Where do you think that the vaccine records should reside in the tool. Should they be in a separate section, or included in the medical records?
- Can you give us some information about After-Visit Summaries? Why haven’t they been included in MHV up to this point?
- What do you think about including the After-Visit Summary (AVS) in the VA Health Summary? Where should After-Visit Summaries be housed in MHV?

## Fifth Task: Limitations - X minutes

- Are there any technical limitations that we should keep in mind? Is there anything that is possible technically but would be extremely difficult or time consuming?

## Sixth Task: Medical Records Vision - X minutes

- The current vision for MHV can be applied to Medical Records. It states that: We aim to reduce the number of websites, products, and interfaces Veterans must use in order to get health care and manage their health — and we aim to make those experiences easy and intuitive. In a single place on VA.gov, Veterans will be able to manage all interactions with VA related to health, plus learn about health conditions and health news. Interactions that cross VA.gov, the VA.gov flagship mobile app, email, text messages, and VA facilities will be seamless.
- What would you add to the vision specific to Medical Records?

## Seventh Task: Cerner - X minutes

- Based on your understanding, how will the migration to Cerner affect a patient’s medical records? Specifically, what data will be available?
- If a patient goes to a facility that uses Cerner, and then returns to a facility that uses VistA, what happens to their medical records? 
- Do you have any ability, today, to access the medical records information created at one of the few Cerner facilities? 
- Should the Medical Records page be built to conform to Cerner standards, even if some user requests cannot be met, or should that be considered later? (Coulton: I don’t understand this question as written. Could you explain?)
