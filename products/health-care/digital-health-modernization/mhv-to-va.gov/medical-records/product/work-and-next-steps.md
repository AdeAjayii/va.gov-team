## Where we are with records
**1) We created and tested concepts for a "Medical records" landing page on MHV on VA.gov:**
- [Desktop prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/908b453b-ef8b-4193-b955-ea00f9fd14aa/prototype/a/44472CCE-CE14-4CED-9B07-E87CFED3EFE6)
- [Mobile prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/908b453b-ef8b-4193-b955-ea00f9fd14aa/prototype/a/0F31920D-6FE8-4239-8207-3F129FCEA6E4?hotspots=false)

**2) We've met with these partners, stakeholders, and subject-matter experts and incorporated learnings from them in Github and Mural:**
- My HealtheVet designers (Arienne Walters, Bobby Bailey) - July 14
- My HealtheVet records section PoCs (Carnetta Scruggs, Bresha Lipscomb) - June 22 [(See notes from this meeting in Mural.)](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1654869136822/fd8bebaa98bd723136ea04c71212d888f75f3c83?sender=megpeters0505)
- OCC and OCTO leadership + the OCC senior adviser (Nancy Wilck, Theresa Hancock, Chris Johnston, Lauren Alexanderson, Dr. Neil Evans) - July 18
- "Search my record" (Rich Beaudoin, David/Boomer Rawlins) - July 20

**3) We've gathered screen shots of:**
- the My HealtheVet Records section, and
- Cerner records screens

[See the Mural of My HealtheVet and Cerner records screens.](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1658960897509/d517d764e4df567e41585d1c53831cebd17e40af?sender=megpeters0505)

**4) The My HealtheVet UCD Team did analysis and a usability study on "Search my record" in October 2021.**
"Search my record" is a software application that lets you apply filters to your VA medical records. In your results set, each data point (ex: a set of lab results), is a separate item you can click into for details.

After the dark launch of ["Search my record,"](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/search-my-record) the My HealtheVet UCD Team did a research study with Veterans and provided recommendations for usability fixes to the UI. MHV's UCD Team was not involved in the original design and development of "Search my record." In making recommendations, they tried to create a customizable way for Veterans to use records quickly while on the go.

[Read the doc that outlines the differences between Blue Button Report and "Search my record" by the MHV UCD Team's Arienne Walters and Bobby Bailey.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/assets/Search%20My%20VA%20Health%20Record%20-%20Differences%20from%20Blue%20Button.docx) 

## Challenges
There are a lot of complexities with records because of:
- Veteran health data that comes from DoD (Department of Defense),
- privacy and security issues, and
- system interoperability issues (ex: Ideally DoD systems would talk to VA systems.) 

These complexities lead to some challenges:
- Understanding the data and data sources
- Condensing the output when a Veteran downloads records (i.e., taking out info that's not needed)
- Communicating and coordinating with many groups at VA [(See this list of partners, stakeholders, and subject-matter experts.)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/product/team-partners-SMEs.md)
- Learning and following privacy and security policies (ex: keep health information private)

## Recommendations 
Here are some rough initial recommendations based on initial conversations with partners, past user research, and some digging into the records UX.


- Keep VA Health Summary (VAHS) >> Explain purpose clearly
- Explain the difference b/t BB and VAHS so Veterans know the purpose of each and can decide easily which one they need
- Clarify the purpose of VAHS v. BB or SMR >> Which is my complete record? Which one do I take to a non-VA provider? Participants weren’t sure what the difference was between their VA Health Summary and their Blue Button Report.
- Combine BB and Search my record functionality. Do not have 2 products that do almost the same thing. Pick one interaction: BB download or Search my record
- Call out these things in the records section: labs and tests, vaccinations & immunizations 
- Make it clearer how to share health data with docs (vault) 
- Make it so you can share data from devices
