# Vision, work, and recommendations


We can apply the vision described in the [product brief for MHV on VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/product/product-brief.md) (a.k.a. the "health apartment") to medical records.

> We aim to reduce the number of websites, products, and interfaces Veterans must use in order to get health care and manage their health â€” and we aim to make those experiences easy and intuitive. In a single place on VA.gov, Veterans will be able to manage all interactions with VA related to health, plus learn about health conditions and health news. Interactions that cross VA.gov, the VA.gov flagship mobile app, email, text messages, and VA facilities will be seamless.

This is the broad vision. We've had conversations about the vision
