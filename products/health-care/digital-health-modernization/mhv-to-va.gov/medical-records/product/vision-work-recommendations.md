# Vision, work, and recommendations
July 27, 2022

## Vision for medical records
We can apply the vision described in the [product brief for MHV on VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/product/product-brief.md) (a.k.a. the "health apartment") to medical records.

> We aim to reduce the number of websites, products, and interfaces Veterans must use in order to get health care and manage their health â€” and we aim to make those experiences easy and intuitive. In a single place on VA.gov, Veterans will be able to manage all interactions with VA related to health, plus learn about health conditions and health news. Interactions that cross VA.gov, the VA.gov flagship mobile app, email, text messages, and VA facilities will be seamless.

That is the broad vision for the Veteran health experience. There are aspects of the experience that also need a vision, and we've begun conversations about some of them. 

### Patient-generated data (PGD)
Also known as patient-generated health data (PGHD), this is health data that Veterans either:
- Enter into the VA website through forms (They do it on My HealtheVet today.), or
- Upload from an application or wearable device. (This is the future.)
