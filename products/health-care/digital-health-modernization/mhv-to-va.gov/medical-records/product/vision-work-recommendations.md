# Vision, work, and recommendations

## Vision for medical records
We can apply the vision described in the [product brief for MHV on VA.gov](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/product/product-brief.md) (a.k.a. the "health apartment") to medical records.

> We aim to reduce the number of websites, products, and interfaces Veterans must use in order to get health care and manage their health — and we aim to make those experiences easy and intuitive. In a single place on VA.gov, Veterans will be able to manage all interactions with VA related to health, plus learn about health conditions and health news. Interactions that cross VA.gov, the VA.gov flagship mobile app, email, text messages, and VA facilities will be seamless.

That is the broad vision for the Veteran health experience. There are aspects of the experience that also need a vision, and we've begun conversations about some of them. 

### Vision for patient-generated data (PGD)
Also known as patient-generated health data (PGHD), this is health data that Veterans either:
- Enter into the VA website through forms (They do it on My HealtheVet today.), or
- Upload from an application or wearable device. (This is the future.)

VA’s philosophy differs from Cerner's:
VA’s philosophy is that EHR data and data from the patient are 2 discrete things that should be managed separately. 
— The EHR needs to contain an organized set of data that providers can use to make decisions. 
— PGD should be separate from the EHR (Electronic Health Record). Wearable devices can contain a tremendous amount of data, and this is difficult for providers to parse and leverage. But a provider can decide to enter data a patient gave them into the EHR.

What’s missing: 
— VA has not addressed the question of of PGD being part of the comprehensive health record.
— Cerner doesn’t have an approach to dealing with FitBit data (i.e., data from wearable devices).

#### "Subscribe and prescribe" is the vision of the Office of Connected Care (OCC) leadership  
— Veterans want a place to record things. They want to share with their providers. 
— If we were to prescribe recording health data and using apps to Veterans, we could have culture change. 
— Providers would subscribe to PGD.
— VA would display PGD in a meaningful way to support clinical decisions (ex: Virtual Care Manager software for VA providers).

Currently: 
— Veterans can opt to share self-entered data or not. 
— Veterans can go into the “vault,” where the data is. Without VA promoting this, ~10K Vets have and are sharing data (unclear of the time period).
— PGHD includes the existing self-entered data apps at mobile.va.gov built by OCC.
