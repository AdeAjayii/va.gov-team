# Background for medical records
July 26, 2022

## What's in records? 
Currently VA has 2 types of medical records: 
- **Blue Button:** A Veteran's entire health record with VA. If the Veteran provided their VA doctor with health data from a non-VA doctor (ex: prescriptions), their VA doctor can enter that info into their VA health record.
<br></br>
- **My VA Health Summary (a.k.a. CCD, CCDA, or Continuity of Care Document):** If a Veteran sees a non-VA provider, they show that provider this document. The VA Health Summary supports continuity of care between providers.

### Blue Button:
The Blue Button report contains the following data. The report contains the largest set of health data VA has for a Veteran. You can view the report in a browser or download it as a PDF.
