# Background for medical records
July 26, 2022

## What's in records? 
Currently VA has 2 types of medical records: 
- **Blue Button:** A Veteran's entire health record with VA. If the Veteran provided their VA doctor with health data from a non-VA doctor (ex: prescriptions), their VA doctor can enter that info into their VA health record.
- **My VA Health Summary (a.k.a. CCD, CCDA, or Continuity of Care Document):** If a Veteran sees a non-VA provider, they show that provider this document. The VA Health Summary supports continuity of care between providers.

### Blue Button:
The Blue Button report contains the following data. You can view the report in a browser or download it as a PDF,
- Appointments (VA future, past)
- Medications (VA med history + self-entered)
- Labs and tests (VA lab results, pathology reports, radiology reports, EKGs + self-entered) 
- EHR history and wellness reminders (VA problem list, admissions and discharges, notes, wellness reminders)
- Allergies (VA + self-entered)
- Immunizations (VA + self-entered)
- Vitals and readings (VA + self-entered)
- Health history (self-entered)
- Food and activity journals (self-entered)
- Goals (current, completed >> all self-entered)
- Demographics and health insurance (VA + self-entered)
