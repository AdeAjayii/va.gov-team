## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you [first name]?

My name is Anne. I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be selectable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_[If yes: ]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_[If no:]_  I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

_[If yes:]_  Thank you! We very much appreciate you talking with us today. 


- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**   We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

- _[If yes: ]_ **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_[Start recording.]_

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

- Do you use My HealtheVet?

_[If yes]_

- How often? How do you feel about it?
- Do you use it to access your medical records?

_[If yes]_

How often? How do you feel about it?

- What type of device are you using today?

[If on Desktop/Laptop/Tablet:] I am going to have you take over the mouse on my screen. As soon as I get set up, I will give you instructions on what to do. _[when ready]_ I am going to hand over control in just a second. When I do, you will see a notification pop up on your screen and then you will be able to control my screen. Ready?

_[If on mobile: ]_ Have you shared your screen over Zoom with your phone?

_[If yes: ]_ I dropped the link to the prototype in the chat. Go ahead and pull it up and when you are ready to share, please do so.

_[If no, follow protocol for particular OS (Android/iOS)]_

**Participant Coaching**

Today we are trying to learn how a Veteran might use this product if they were on their own. Of course, we are here and using a prototype, so to make it as natural as possible, we included a back button at the top left. This is to take the place of the back button you might use on your browser.

Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can't see your screen. Does that make sense?

_[for MHV users]_ This is going to look slightly familiar, but please remember that this is a new design we are testing and some elements you might expect to be there will not and some you don't expect will.

Are you ready to dive in?

## **First Task: Lab and tests: EKG + Radiology – 7-10 minutes**

_Electrocardiogram_

- Can you walk me through how you would find the date of your most recent electrocardiogram?

_[if the participant selects Share your medical record]:_

- Can you tell me about why Share your medical record was your first choice for this task?
- What would you do on this page to find the date of your most recent electrocardiogram?

_[if the participant states they would download/print BB ask]_

- Once you had access to that report, how quickly and easily do you feel you could find that information?
- Could there be another way to find that information without running a report?

_[help the participant navigate back to About VA medical records if necessary]_

_[when the participant finds the date]:_

- How do you know that this is the most recent electrocardiogram? 

_[if participant is on details screen]:_
Please return to Lab and test results.

_Radiology_

For the next part of this task, there will be x-rays on the screen. This may be triggering for some and we want to be mindful of your comfort. Are you comfortable viewing x-rays?
_[if no]_ Thank you for letting me know. We will skip that part.

- Can you describe to me what is on this page?
- Is this how you would expect the labs and test results to be listed?
  - _[if no]_ What would be more helpful?

- Let's say you had x-rays taken of your ankle and you wanted to review the results.
- How would you do that?

_[when report opened]_
- What information do you find helpful here?
- Would you expect the actual x-ray images to be here?
- Is there a place on this page where you can find them?

_[images screen]_

- Is access to images helpful to you? Is there any information it provides that the report does not?

Please return to About VA medical records.


**Things to watch for:**

- Did the participant notice that EKG's are historical only?
- Did the participant notice that labs and tests are listed in reverse chronological order?


## **Second Task: Lab and test results: Bloodwork + download - 5 minutes**

_Bloodwork:_

- Let's say you wanted to review your bloodwork from October 26, 2021. Walk me through how you would do that.

_[when details page is open]:_

- Please describe this page and share your thoughts about it.

- What might someone do if they needed help understanding these results?
-Is there anything here that can help?

_Download:_

- Can you walk me through what you would do if you wanted to save a copy of this report?

_[when participant returns to report screen]_

- How would you know if your file downloaded?
- How did you know to choose "download as PDF" rather than "download as TXT"?
_[or visa versa if they chose txt]_

-What might a Veteran do if they were unsure?
- Is there anything here that might help with that?

**Things to watch for:**
- Did the participant get confused by multiple bloodwork results?
- Did the participant get confused by the acronyms?
- Did the participant notice the informational dropdowns?
- Was the participant able to download?
- Which format did the participant choose?

## **Third Task: Health history + print – 10 minutes**

- Let's say you spent time in the hospital on April 6th and 7th. You have questions you want to ask your primary care doctor at your upcoming visit, but you don't have the paperwork the nurse gave you when you were discharged.  Can you walk me through what you would do in this system to get another copy?

- What if you were filling out some paperwork and need to include the date you were first diagnosed with high blood pressure?

- You think you have had your blood pressure under control, but you are curious about the past few readings taken during office visits. How might you review those?

Please return to the Vitals page.
- Is this how you would expect the Vitals to be listed?
  - _[if no]_ What would be more helpful?
- Which of these do you feel is most important for managing your health?

You know you had your flu shot last fall, but you can't remember the date.
- How would you find it?

You decide to print out all of your vaccines so you have a record handy in your files.
- What would be the best way to do that?

_[if the participant says they would print each individual record, ask:]_
-is there a way you could print the whole list as one document?

**Things to watch for:**

- Did the participant know that hypertension is high blood pressure?
- Did the participant know to search in vitals for blood pressure?
- Did the participant know that they could print the entire vaccine list?

## **Fourth Task: Health history: Participant choice + Vitals +Vaccines – 10 minutes**

Let's review Allergies.

- What if a Veteran developed a sudden allergy to eggs and were treated at a community hospital. How would they go about getting that allergy added to this list? Is there anything here that might help with that?

I would like to ask you some questions about the print and download options here. The button says, "print or download list."

- Why do you think a Veteran might want to print or download their list of Allergies?
- The same option is available for Vaccines as well. Why do you think a Veteran might want to print or download their list of Vaccines?

These are the only 2 sections that allow you to print the whole list while other records, such as the admission and discharge summary we looked at earlier, only allow you to print the page.

 - Do you have any thoughts on why only Vaccines and Allergies would allow you to print or download the whole list?

**Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant understand that they cannot add allergies?
- Did the participant notice the informational dropdown?
- Did the participant understand why only allergies and vaccines can be printed as whole lists?

## **Fifth Task: Share your medical records – 5 minutes**

- If you had an upcoming appointment with a new community provider and wanted to take a copy of your medical records, what would you do?

- Did the participant understand "Blue Button"?
- Did the participant understand how to share medical records with a VA provider?

## **Sixth Task: PDF vs. Web Layout [Desktop only] – 5 minutes**

This is the PDF that would be generated if we were to print or download the bloodwork report from earlier.

- Can you describe to me what is on this PDF?
- Is this what you would have expected?
  - _[if no]_ What would make it more helpful?

_[MHV users only]_

- Have you downloaded or printed any medical records on My Health_e_Vet?

_[if yes]_

- How does this compare?

Now I am going to place the PDF next to the web version.

- Compare the two and when you are ready, please share what thoughts you have.

**Things to watch for:**

- Was the participant able to understand the contents of the PDF report?
- How did the participant react to the differences between the web layout and the PDF?
