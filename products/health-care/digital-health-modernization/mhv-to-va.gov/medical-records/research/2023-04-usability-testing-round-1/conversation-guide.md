## **Intro - 5 minutes**

Thanks for joining us today! May I call you [first name]?

My name is Anne. I'm a usability researcher, and I work as part of a team that is improving VA's websites and other resources for Veterans. We reach out to Veterans as we design these resources to get their input so we can help make sure we meet their needs.

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call. I have one teammate who will be taking notes to make sure that we accurately represent your feedback. We won't link any notes to your name or other personal information. The others are just here to observe. Do I have your permission to let them into the session?

_[If yes: ]_ Thank you. When they are connected, I will ask them to make a quick introduction.

_[If no:]_  I appreciate you letting me know. Please give me a quick moment to let them know.

_[If yes:]_  Thank you! We very much appreciate you talking with us today. Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.**  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.**  This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be selectable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**   We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

- _[If yes: ]_ **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_[Start recording.]_

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## **Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

- Do you use My Health_e_Vet?

_[If yes]_

- How often? How do you feel about it?
- Do you use it to access your medical records?

_[If yes]_

How often? How do you feel about it?

- What type of device are you using today?

[If on Desktop/Laptop/Tablet:] I am going to have you take over the mouse on my screen. As soon as I get set up, I will give you instructions on what to do. _[when ready]_ I am going to hand over control in just a second. When I do, you will see a notification pop up on your screen and then you will be able to control my screen. Ready?

_[If on mobile: ]_ Have you shared your screen over Zoom with your phone?

_[If yes: ]_ I dropped the link to the prototype in the chat. Go ahead and pull it up and when you are ready to share, please do so.

_[If no, follow protocol for particular OS (Android/iOS)]_

**Participant Coaching**

Today we are trying to learn how a Veteran might use this product if they were on their own. Of course, we are here and using a prototype, so to make it as natural as possible, we included a back button at the top left. This is to take the place of the back button you might use on your browser.

Part of understanding how well this product works is to know what you, the user, are thinking and feeling while you are using it. As much as possible today, we would like you to say aloud anything you are thinking or feeling no matter how significant or insignificant you may think it is. Imagine that you are doing the tasks today and I am on the phone with you and can't see your screen. Does that make sense?

_[for MHV users]_ This is going to look slightly familiar, but please remember that this is a new design we are testing and some elements you might expect to be there will not and some you don't expect will.

Are you ready to dive in?
