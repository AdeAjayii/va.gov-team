## Intro Questions - 15 minutes

## Medical Records Vision - 5-10 minutes
- The current vision for MHV can be applied to Medical Records. It states that: 
We aim to reduce the number of websites, products, and interfaces Veterans must use in order to get health care and manage their health â€” and we aim to make those experiences easy and intuitive. In a single place on VA.gov, Veterans will be able to manage all interactions with VA related to health, plus learn about health conditions and health news. Interactions that cross VA.gov, the VA.gov flagship mobile app, email, text messages, and VA facilities will be seamless.
- What would you add to the vision specific to Medical Records?
- We are especially interested defining a vision for Track your health information and Patient-generated health data. Is there anything related to these topics that you think should be included in a vision?
