# Research Plan for HMI team, Medical Records, October/ November 2022

## Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. MHV provides Veterans with access to their medical records, including the ability to download said records. 

We have conducted prior discover research in September, 2022 (see [this folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/research/2022-09-informational-interviews) for more information). This has helped us to identify and prioritize gaps that we must address via primary research with Veterans to ensure that the Medical Records experience on the redesigned MHV will enable Veterans to complete their top tasks with minimal pain points.

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	
The purpose of this research is to gain insight into user needs and goals related to medical records, users' emic understandings of medical records-related terms, and how these needs, goals, and understandings influence their behaviors. 

### Outcome
This research will inform the low fidelity prototype for the medical records redesign on VA.gov. 

### Research questions

1. What terms do Veterans use to describe: medical records, laboratory results, medical test results, medical imaging, radiology, pathology, service-related records from the Department of Defense, admisions & discharge summaries, pre-visit and after-visit summaries, and procedures? 

2. How do Veterans understand the existing medical records-related terminology on MHV and how does that understanding shape their behaviors? 

3. What actions do Veterans need to take with their medical records and for what purposes? 


### Hypotheses
_Hypothesis 1:_ Some Veterans will use different terms for at least some of the medical records-related terms. 

_Hypthesis 2:_ Some Veterans will not understand all of the medical records-related terms without support. 

_Hypothesis 3:_ Some Veterans will not know what Blue Button, VA Health Summary, and Department of Defense medical records include, nor will know where to find specific information across the three options. 

_Hypothesis 4:_ Some Veterans will want to be able to view and share their medical records, while others will want to identify key information to use for other purposes (e.g., to support a disability claim). 

## Method

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information (whether the Veteran has used MyHealtheVet before; whether the Veteran uses VA healthcare) in an encrypted Google Sheet that will be stored on the Ad Hoc Google Drive. 

## Recruitment criteria
We will schedule a total of 24 Veterans for an expected completion rate of 18-20 usability tests.
