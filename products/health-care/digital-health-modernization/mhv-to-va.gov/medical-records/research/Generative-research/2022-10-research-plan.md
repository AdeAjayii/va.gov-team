# Research Plan for HMI team, Medical Records, October/ November 2022

## Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. MHV provides Veterans with access to their medical records, including the ability to download said records. 

We have conducted prior discover research in September, 2022 (see [this folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/research/2022-09-informational-interviews) for more information). This has helped us to identify and prioritize gaps that we must address via primary research with Veterans to ensure that the Medical Records experience on the redesigned MHV will enable Veterans to complete their top tasks with minimal pain points.

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	
The goals of this study are to:



### Research questions

_Finding a message:_

1. Do Veterans understand that the Search function only searches within a particular folder? How does this affect their behaviors?

2. Do Veterans expect the Search function to search within message attachments and threads? How does this affect their behaviors?


### Hypothesis
Describe. 

## Method
Card sorting
Interviews

### Location
Data collection will be remote. We will use Optimal Workshop for the card sorting activity and Zoom for interviews. 

### Research materials
[Conversation guide](location)
