## Research Goals

The Health Apartment team has been tasked with moving MHV onto VA.gov, improving its functionality in a Veteran-centered way, and to deliver a seamless UX whether a patient goes to a VistA or Cerner facility. Within MHV, there are four primary pieces of functionality: appointments, secure messaging, accessing your medical records, and pharmacy. The following research plan seeks to lay the foundation for successfully redesigning and migrating the medical records functionality in MHV.

For a Veteran to properly manage their health, they must understand their health. Medical records are a key component in doing so, providing a record of current and past health issues. Veterans also use medical records to ensure continuity of care when seeing non-VA providers and leverage medical records for evidence when filing disability claims.

The purpose of this research was

- To understand what data exists in MHV medical records and the technical constraints of that data.

- To understand the policies, laws, and product history that influence MHV medical records.

- To understand known usability issues with medical records and garner preliminary ideas for ways to improve them.\

## Research Questions

**Data:**

- Where do the Health Summary and Blue Button sections of MHV pull data from? What mechanism do they use?

- How can the VA Health Summary and Blue Button sections be combined? Should they be combined?

**Policies and laws:**

- What are the policies and laws that pertain to medical records?

- In what ways do laws and policies affect what is included in a medical record and how it must be accessed?

**Product history:**

- Why problems were medical records (Blue Button and VA Health Summary) designed to solve?

- Why are medical records designed to primarily be downloaded and then viewed, rather than viewed in browser?

**Usability:**

- What information in medical records do users access most frequently? What is their primary mode of access?

- What parts of medical records cause Veterans the most frustration?
