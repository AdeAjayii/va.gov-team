### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to gain insight into user needs and goals related to medical records, users' emic understandings of medical records-related terms, and how these needs, goals, and understandings influence their behaviors. This information will inform the redesign of health records on the Health Apartment on VA.gov. 

## Research Questions

1. What terms do Veterans and Caregivers use to describe: medical records, laboratory results, medical test results, medical imaging, radiology, pathology, service-related records from the Department of Defense, admissions & discharge summaries, pre-visit and after-visit summaries, and procedures? 

2. How do Veterans and Caregivers understand the existing medical records-related terminology on MHV and how does that understanding shape their behavior on the website (e.g., where they look for specific information)? 

3. What actions do Veterans and Caregivers need to take with their medical records and for what purposes?

## Methodology 

### Data collection
We conducted remote interviews with Zoom. These interviews included questions about user needs and goals related to medical records, what users expect medical records should include, what terms they use and how they understand existing terms found in the legacy MHV. The interviews also included a moderated card sorting activity.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypothesis 1:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will use different terms than those displayed via Blue Button reports for at least some of the medical records-related terms. 

   TRUE: Participants used terms like "Health history," "Health record", "Chart", and "Portal," in addition to "Medical records." Some also used the term "My" in conjunction with other options - e.g., "My Chart," "My Health Record," "My Health History." 

_Hypthesis 2:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will not understand all of the medical records-related terms without support.
   
   TRUE: Terms like "Pathology results" and "Encounter notes" often generated confusion amongst participants. Medical terms found on Blue Button reports were not universally understood by participants. 

_Hypothesis 3:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will not know what Blue Buttona and VA Health Summary include, nor will know where to find specific information across the three options. 
   
   TRUE: Participants consistently misunderstood what was available in Blue Button and VA Health Summary reports. 

_Hypothesis 4:_ Some Veterans and Caregivers will want to be able to view and share their medical records, while others will want to identify key information to use for other purposes (e.g., to support a disability claim).

   TRUE: Use cases for medical records can be broadly categorized into wanting to understand one's records, advocate and coordinate care using one's records, and record keep. These use cases will be explained in greater detail in the findings section. 

## Key Findings

1. Participants used a range of terms to refer to medical records, such as "Health history," "Health record", "Chart", and "Portal," in addition to "Medical records." Some also used the term "My" in conjunction with other options - e.g., "My Chart," "My Health Record," "My Health History." 

2. Electronic medical records can be viewed, downloaded, or shared. Participants described wanting to access their medical records to: 
   - Understand their health by reviewing vitals or other health monitorings (by viewing online)
   - Monitoring their needs, particularly appointments or medications and medication refills (by viewing online)
   - Understand an issue by reviewing doctors' notes, labs/tests, images with notes, or past appointments or medications (by viewing online)
   - Advocate for their needs by reviewing what has and hasn't been done (by viewing online)
   - Coordinate care across healthcare providers, particularly with providers outside the VA (by sharing)
   - Keep a local record that they can review or adapt as needed (by downloading)
   - Identify evidence that can be used to obtain benefits, including non-VA benefits (by viewing, downloading, and sharing)

3. The most common categories participants used during the card sort included lab/test results (12 out of 15 participants), and separate categories for "non-body" health issuess - mental health and dental health (10 out of 15 participants). 

4. An "About me/ Personal information" category was often created by participants, though the contents of this category differed. Some included demographic information, ongoing monitoring information like vitals, allergies and immunizations, and a "shapshot" of current health, issues, and treatments. Others contained only some of this information. This category varied the most across interviews and explanations often seemed contradictory and incoherent, however, this category still existed in the majority (n=10) of interviews. 

5. Most participants organized or described expecting medical record information to be accessed in relation to one of three "anchors": by appointments; by the location or type of facility; or by practice area. 

6. Time was a consistent theme across interviews. Participants expected information to be organized in relation to time -  most often with most recent information more easily accessible, particularly if a patient needed to do anything with information (e.g., schedule a follow-up visit, or ask a question for a healthcare provider). In this way, time intersected with urgency, in that some participants described wanting recent information that needed to be acted upon made immediately evident in health records. 

7. Participants had a range of interpretations for some medical terminology, like "pathology results", indicating misunderstanding of some health terms found in current medical records.

**1. Participants used a range of terms to refer to medical records, such as "Health history," "Health record", "Chart", and "Portal," in addition to "Medical records." Some also used the term "My" in conjunction with other options - e.g., "My Chart," "My Health Record," "My Health History."**

Labels: label 1, label 2 

The most common term used was "health record" or "medical record," followed by "health history" and "patient portal." 

Participants consistently argued that the same term should be used for online records as paper-based records.
