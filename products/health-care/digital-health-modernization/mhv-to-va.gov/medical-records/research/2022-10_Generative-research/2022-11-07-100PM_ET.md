 
## Warm-up Questions - 5-10 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)*

2. *(If using assistive technology:)* How would you rate your level of experience with using [specific assistive technology, such as a screen reader]--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?

	- *(If using assistive technology:)* How long have you been using [specific assistive technology]?

3. Like I said, we are talking to Veterans and caregivers about how they look for their health information and what they want to do with their information, and what all that might mean for us when considering how to improve the website. Thinking along those lines, I'm going to ask you a question: 
	
	As we age, we continue to have health-related experiences that need to be documented. If all your health issues, treatments, and other histories were combined into one list, what would you call that list?  

	- *OPTIONAL PROBES:* Would different types of information be in different lists? What types of lists would be in one list versus a different list? *(Interviewer can continue to probe to provide clarity on what types of information should be grouped or can move on, depending on how participant is responding.)*

4. What if that/those list(s) were available online - what would you call it/them?

## Section 1: Past experiences - 15-20 minutes
5. Have you ever seen or downloaded information about your health? This could be any information about your health history, about current health problem, or what you are doing to stay healthy. 

6. What did you need to do, see, or download? 

7. What did you want to learn or do with this information? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBES:* Did you want to share this information with anyone? If so, with who? For what purpose? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBES:* Did you want to keep this information for yourself? If so, what made you want to do that?

8. In the last 1-2 times you were looking online for information about your health history, current health issues, or anything about your healthcare, what kind of health information were you trying to find? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* What kind of information would you most want to find quickly? 

9. In the last 1-2 times you were looking online for information about your health history, current health issues, or anything about your healthcare, what did you want to do after you found what you were looking for? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* Did you want to download your entire *(use the word the participant is using for medical records)* or just use specific information? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* Did you need to share your *(use the word the participant is using for medical records)* with anyone? If yes, with who? For what purpose? 

10. I am going to share my screen to show you an image of a current website that has the *(use the word the participant is using for medical records)* for Veterans. *(Screen share and show image of Blue Button and VA Health Summary section of MHV.)*

	- What would you expect to find in the Blue Button section? 

	- What would you expect to find in the VA Health Summary section? 

	- What would you expect to find in the Images section?

## Section 2A: Card sort - 15-20 mins 
*(USE THIS SCENARIO FIRST; IF DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR PARTICIPANT, OR PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCES TECHNICAL CHALLENGES, MOVE ONTO SECTION 2B)*

## Section 2: Card sort - 15-20 mins (https://bit.ly/mrcardsort)
Now we are going to do a sorting activity. 

This sorting activity is a tool that helps us to understand how Veterans would group certain items. If we can understand how items are grouped, we can then organize them in a way that makes it easier for Veterans to find what they need quickly. For example, if you were to organize a refrigerator, you might put certain food types together - like cheeses - to make it easier for you to find a cheese you like when you need it. 

**Example card sort**
*Preview link for demonstration purposes: https://dj540s05.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/vtqh45gr/sort*

We will be using a website to do the sorting activity. I'll show you how it works. 

First, you'll see this screen on the left that has a list of different cards with information on them. On the right, you can drag items and group them together. Try to think of these groups as broader categories.

We ask folks to organize the cards into different groups that make sense to you. What are the things that different cards have in common? Or that make the groups different from each other? 

For me, looking at these cards on the left, I can organize the "Vanilla ice cream", "Cheddar cheese", and "Milk" cards together. I can rename the group by clicking on the "Click to rename" button at the top of the group - I'll rename this group "Dairy." I can organize "Lettuce" and "Broccoli" into a second group and label that "Vegetables." I have no idea what food group "cotton candy" might belong to, so I could put it in the "I don't know" group. 

If I decide that I don't like a group that I made, I can also click the x in the top righthand side of the box and the cards get returned to the left hand column. 

Do you have any questions at this point? 

**Share Optimal Workshop link with participant**

First, would you mind sharing your screen? To share your screen, please tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

Now I need to share with you a link to the sorting activity. How would you prefer the link to the sorting activity? I could say it out loud for you to put into your browser, or I could put it in the Zoom chat. 
- [Card sort link](https://bit.ly/mrcardsort): https://bit.ly/mrcardsort 


**Instructions to open the card sort:**
* Go to the chat in zoom. It is located at the bottom of this zoom window and looks like a speech bubble.
* Click on the link for the optimal workshop card sort.

*If participant needs extra instructions, or needs instructions to be repeated, use these:* 
* On the left, we have different cards with information about health information. 
* On the right, you can drag items and group them together. Try to think of these groups as broader categories. 
* If you do not recognize what something is on one of the cards, or need me to explain it a bit more, let me know.

* Any questions at this point?

* Organize cards in a way that makes sense to you
	* We will start at the top left and work our way through the cards, while we are moving them, help me out by “thinking out loud” so that I can understand why you might want to group things together.

11. *(As participant puts cards into different groups)*: Can you explain to me what you are thinking as you put *(card name)* and *(card name)* together? Why do those belong together? 

	- *Continue to probe participant to explain their thinking as they group cards.*
	
12. *(Review categories where you would like to understand what participants look for in a given category, like appointments)*: I see you created *(category)*. When you review information in *(category name)*, what data would be most important for you to know? 
	
	- *Example question*: When you review your appointments, what information would be most important for you to know?

13. *PROBE FOR UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENT CARDS AND TERMS, IF PARTICIPANT NOT EXPLAINING. Particularly interested in understanding how users understand technical medical language. Example probes could be:*

	- What do you think "Pathology results" are? 
	- How are you understanding "Radiology results or images"? 
	- What do you think the difference is between "Encounter notes" and "Progress notes"? 

- When complete: Please go ahead and click the finish button so we can save these groupings. It’ll be anonymous. *(If going to use scenarios in Section 2B, wait until you have completed those questions before asking participant to submit their card sort.)*

**Moderator notes:**

- We are not concerned with prioritizing cards within the grouping.

## Section 2B: Grouping like ideas - 15-20 mins

*ASK THESE QUESTIONS IF UNABLE TO DO CARD SORTING ACTIVITY DESCRIBED IN SECTION 2A, OR ASK THESE QUESTIONS IN RELATION TO THE CATEGORIES THE PARTICIPANT CREATED IN SECTION 2A.*

Now I'm going to ask you where you would look for different types of information on a patient portal. When I say "patient portal," I mean a website or app that you can log into and find information about your personal health history, where you can communicate with your healthcare providers, and even where you can make appointments, find care, or pay your healthcare bills, depending on the portal. 

14. *SCENARIO:* Let's say you have diabetes and you want to see your most recent blood sugar levels based off of a blood draw they did the last time you saw your doctor. If you go into your patient portal, where would you look for that information? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* If there was a header, or section of the page where you would expect to find this information, what would that tab be named? 
	
	- What other kind of information would you expect to find there? 

	- *If participant completed card sorting activity in Section 2A*: In which of the categories you created would you look for that information? 

15. *SCENARIO:* Imagine that you have come to one of your patient portals (could be for the VA, or some other provider) looking for information about a diagnosis from a service-related injury that you need to file a disability claim. Where do you think that information would be found?

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* If there was a header, or section of the page where you would expect to find this information, what would that tab be named? 
	
	- What other kind of information would you expect to find there?

	- *If participant completed card sorting activity in Section 2A*: In which of the categories you created would you look for that information?

16. *SCENARIO:* What about if you were looking to find a plan for how your doctor was going to treat a health issue that you have - where would you look for that plan? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* If there was a header, or section of the page where you would expect to find this information, what would that tab be named? 
	
	- What other kind of information would you expect to find there?

	- *If participant completed card sorting activity in Section 2A*: In which of the categories you created would you look for that information?

17. *SCENARIO:* Now imagine that you are trying to find the results of some blood tests that you had done in the past month. Where would you look for that information?  

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* If there was a header, or section of the page where you would expect to find this information, what would that tab be named? 
	
	- What other kind of information would you expect to find there?

	- *If participant completed card sorting activity in Section 2A*: In which of the categories you created would you look for that information?

18. *SCENARIO:* Let's say you are trying to find proof that you have been vaccinated against Yellow Fever so you can travel to a country where that is a required vaccine. Where would you look for that information in a patient portal? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* If there was a header, or section of the page where you would expect to find this information, what would that tab be named? 
	
	- What other kind of information would you expect to find there?

	- *If participant completed card sorting activity in Section 2A*: In which of the categories you created would you look for that information?

19. *SCENARIO:* Imagine that you switched doctors and you needed to give your newest doctor a list of medications that you had taken in the past. Where would you look for that list in a patient portal? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* If there was a header, or section of the page where you would expect to find this information, what would that tab be named? 
	
	- What other kind of information would you expect to find there?

	- *If participant completed card sorting activity in Section 2A*: In which of the categories you created would you look for that information?

## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes
*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

20. *(IF using a screen reader)* If you wanted to share your thoughts on this web page with the VA, how would you do it? *(Feedback button on bottom right of page that's not the home page / ___________)*
     1. Have you *ever* done this before?
     2. If so, how and when?
     3. Could you please go to VA.gov? How would you share your thoughts on this web page?
     4. *(Want to see if screen reader users can/will use the Medallia feedback button)*

21. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 

## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.
