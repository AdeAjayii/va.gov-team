 
## Warm-up Questions - 5-10 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)* Laptop

2. *(If using assistive technology:)* How would you rate your level of experience with using [specific assistive technology, such as a screen reader]--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?

	- *(If using assistive technology:)* How long have you been using [specific assistive technology]?

3. Like I said, we are talking to Veterans and caregivers about how they look for their health information and what they want to do with their information, and what all that might mean for us when considering how to improve the website. Thinking along those lines, I'm going to ask you a question: 
	
	As we age, we continue to have health-related experiences that need to be documented. If all your health issues, treatments, and other histories were combined into one list, what would you call that list?  
	
	Uh,  my health record. 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBES:* Would different types of information be in different lists? What types of lists would be in one list versus a different list? *(Interviewer can continue to probe to provide clarity on what types of information should be grouped or can move on, depending on how participant is responding.)*

Anything to do with my physical health or mental health to include medications that I've taken in the past, that I'm currently taking now, and that I'm allergic to.

Well, this might be under the physical part, but any kind of imaging, any kind of EKC, CAT scans, thost should be in sequence by date

Going back to the old paper chart, your first medical record is on the bottom and it builds up from there with the most recent the most recent opening the chart.  Same thing with the electronic chart.

4. What if that/those list(s) were available online - what would you call it/them?

no, to me that would be confusing to call the same thing by four different names.  Just muddies up the water. To be consistent and standardized in the way we present our medical information is real important

I worked at the Austin VA health clinic for 20 years.  We were one of the few outpatient sites in 1995 to field test the VA's electronic medical record.  There was about 9 months there where we had overlap of the paper record and the electronic record, which meant they weren't fully confident in the electronic record which meant we were priveeldged to keep the paper record.  I saw how the electronic record came to be, so that's my vantage point

With the paper records, every once in a while, we would misplace a paper record, or worst case, we would lose the whole chart, never to be found again. 

Now with the electronic record, we could lose the entire paper record room.  We never lost the entire library.  When the electronic record goes down, mobody can get to a record.  That's a problem I dont think they anticipated.



## Section 1: Past experiences - 15-20 minutes
5. Have you ever seen or downloaded information about your health? This could be any information about your health history, about current health problem, or what you are doing to stay healthy. 

Well I get all of my health care through the VA, OK, so I never really have need to do that.  They sent me out for a colonoscopy priviately one time because they were not able to do that.  The private colonocopy folks forward that to go into. my medical record. Come to think of it, I don't think I've ever inputted anything from a medical provider into my record. 

The VA referred me there, and they provide the info that provider needed to do a full GI colonoscopy

6. What did you need to do, see, or download? 

7. What did you want to learn or do with this information? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBES:* Did you want to share this information with anyone? If so, with who? For what purpose? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBES:* Did you want to keep this information for yourself? If so, what made you want to do that?

8. In the last 1-2 times you were looking online for information about your health history, current health issues, or anything about your healthcare, what kind of health information were you trying to find? 

Like our Headquarters hospital is in Temple TX.  I was seen in the emergency room up there, and to make sure that the emergency at the VAMC in Temple and my doc at the outpatient clinic, I got on secure messaging and let my doctor I had been seen.  I did my part as a patient to make sure she had that information so that/. .... That kind of input secure message to either nurses or my doc, I've done that, yeah.

I used MyHealtheVet via whatever that providing mechanism, and then suddently the VA didn't recognize any inptu from that source.  I had to goou tthere several time and I couldn't access my meds and it would ask for my [user ID] and it would say "that's not your email" 

So finally i went to the outpatient clinic and they gave me an 800 number to call and they said "don't go through yo ur internet provider, just go straight to VA.gov" but no where in that chain did it say to go straight to VA.gov

It's ok, but it took about a month or so to get that ironed out.  You'd think I'd ... I'm 81 years old.  Some of that computer stuff wears off

I was just typing FYI that this has happened and wanted to make sure you were aware of it, but never attaching any imaging or anything

*Do you look for medications online*?

Do I look for, meaning do I reorder?  yeah, yeah.  As soon as I get a medication, I immediately put in my reorder so it will come to me as that current supply diminishes so it will kick up and send me my next one.  Yeah, I order all my meds through MyHealtheVet.

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* What kind of information would you most want to find quickly? 

9. In the last 1-2 times you were looking online for information about your health history, current health issues, or anything about your healthcare, what did you want to do after you found what you were looking for? 

I don't think I have.  I feel like I'm current with everything that's going on with me.  My doc and my psychi are good about keeping me informed about what htey are doing and what my status is.  I think I went and looked for my blood sugar I wanted to know what the VA lab mesaturement of my blookd sugar was that day becuase I did my own finger stick and I wanted to check.  That was kind of a cross-checck sort of thing

*Was there any information that the VA provided that was helpful?  What was helpful to see*
It was straightforwad to get into once I got into y chart.  What was helpful was having my blood surgar value, like I had a paper chart; no secrete decoder rings.  


	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* Did you want to download your entire *(use the word the participant is using for medical records)* or just use specific information? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* Did you need to share your *(use the word the participant is using for medical records)* with anyone? If yes, with who? For what purpose? 

10. I am going to share my screen to show you an image of a current website that has the *(use the word the participant is using for medical records)* for Veterans. *(Screen share and show image of Blue Button and VA Health Summary section of MHV.)*

	- What would you expect to find in the Blue Button section? 

well it says that I can view print and download my personal health information.  Now what I know about these kind of pages is that may or may not be there. What they call personal health information and I want to see a chart ,that may or may n ot be there.  Sometimes I've pushed a button on things like this and it says "OK tell us what medications you're on other than VA meds,: and I thought I was going to see what the VA had, but the VA was expeting me to give them information with stuff I was doing outside the VA, if anything

Well, my doctor visits and my psychiatry visits and any kind fo labs that were done that's what comes to the top of my mind

	- What would you expect to find in the VA Health Summary section? 
	
	(sighs) (long pause) Well, I'm thinking, like if I'd been hospitalized, I wold have. summary of what my admitting diagnosis was, maybe a plan. On an outpatient basis, uh I guess again, it's almost the same answer as the one above that there would be summaries of my visits with my health care providers and then all that administrated stuff too, name address, horse power, all that.  yeah, the adminisrative part of the medical, thought hat might be more appropriate for some other section

	- What would you expect to find in the Images section?  
	
	Uh, like if I had a chest x-ray, and this hpapned recently when I went to the emergency room at Timple, I thought I was having a heart attach and they said I had some iatragenic medication issues and they were going to suggest I chage the medication taht was causing all this reapid hardbeat.  That happened on the weekend oto.  The x-ray and the radiologist interpretation of the x-ray I would expect to find.  CT scan, dental xrays. 
	
	Well, on this last trip to the ER, they also found a spot on my upper left lung about the size of my little fingernale, and he's saying it's small, I don't see anything.  The attending physician in the ER said the radiologist say a fain spot in your lung.  Do oyu want to have a CAT scan?  it was late in the afternoon on Sunday, and I was having an appoitnment with my doctor the following week, so I delayedd having a CAT scan done since the attending physican said a week wouldn't make any difference.  But seeing the report and seeing what he said about the chest x-ray, yeah, that was good. Good infomration. 
	
With secure messaging, that Sunday when I got home.  Yeah, this happened about six weeks ago.  Yeah, I've used this stuff.

## Section 2A: Card sort - 15-20 mins 
*(USE THIS SCENARIO FIRST; IF DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR PARTICIPANT, OR PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCES TECHNICAL CHALLENGES, MOVE ONTO SECTION 2B)*

[Adds label 'Lab tests completed'] OK, allergies... I'm thinking that needs to be in a box by itself, allergens because those can be life-threatening.  Well, allergies ought to be under allergies.  [Covid 19 test results, blood test, Pathology results are all under this label0]

[Adds label 'allergies'] Appointments... a pre-visit summary.  Let me kind of look over all this. Blood tests.  Cause I...blood... lab test results. um, good grief. Something I'e always wanted to do, put appointments under an admin section. Not operational, not clinical

[Creates label 'admin'] adminstrative uh has to do with clerks, yeah, this is administrative stuff. Its the kind of stuff that clerks can move around.  They can set up appointments, they can cancel appointments, they can reschedule appoinments,  that's all administrative to me.  That to me makes better typographical sense.  They typography.  That's the admin section

Pahtology us, well to me, uh, yeah, yeah, uh two days ago I went in with a complaint of brhonchitis and shortness of breath, so the first thing they did was test for some pathologies with the Covid 19 and the Flu A test and the Flu B test.  That's a lab test, given the simplest, it's a swab, but it's still a lab test.  Pathology can inclue autopsies too, but from a patient standpoint, workaday, basic healthy patient, when they say pathology, they're looking for something.  The cause of an infection.

[Moves about me under admin]

Ok, counseling sessions that's going to go under progress notes. [creates label 'progress notes'] well, going back to the old paper chart, somebody would come SOAP note - submective, objective, assessment and plan.  That constituted a progress note and the content of those counseling sessions would be there under the subjective parts, where the patient says "i'm having flashbacks and a lightniging bold went off and it's scaring the hell out of me" that's subjective and I'm writing that as they're being told

Ultrasound results,  Yeah, I know where these go.  That's another lab test.  MRI results...come on now, follow me.  Oh, there we go [puts under lab tests completed]. 

Immunizations...Well I'm looking at immunizations and I'm looking at allergies and I've got some allergies I've gotten some immunizations for. I'm going to put immuniztions up here [I don't know] for the time being.   

Antibody test, that's a lab test. [puts under lab tests completed]

Demographic information.  Admin [puts under admin label]

Dental x-rays.  with imaging?  I don't have an imaging yet.  Let's see how do I start a new one? Oh, there we go.  All right... letter of referral.  Now, letter of referral, are they reerring to my ambulatory care doc referring me for a colonscopy.  Yeah, yeah, that would go under the progress notes.  Radiology results and images, I would simplify that and call it images.

It's uh the..radiology is anything done with the MRI, CAT scans, X-rays, and the results to me are what the radiolist would say about it, and there would be the image so you don't have to ...

Procedues.. procedures would really be part of a plan [moves to progress notes] Uh, procedures describe what we're going to do.  Ok were' going to do do a colonosocpy and you're not going to eat for several days, and you're going to take all these washout chemicals, and these are the procedures we're going to do.  That way when someone look s over the progress notes, they can see what the pateitnt was instructed in their plan

Past hospical stay, and that' going to be... Hopspital summaries [creates  hospital summaries label ]and pretty soon I' going to have an outpatient summary

After visit summary, well, you don't visit a hospital, you get admiteted to a hospital, so visit implies an office visit.  

I'm down as far as I can go.  Now it's coing along.  And I want to say. [creates outpatient summary label]

I've got a Norton, when I'm in a group session, I get these Norton updates.  I wish they designed this a little different

They need to have a category under hospital stays and treatment plans would really be progress notes.  That's part of the SOAP note

Am i going to keep going on this?  Blood sugar test - lab.  Reports - yeah.  Race and ethnicity - admin.  Discharge summary - progress notes

Encounter notes.  That's going under progress notes.   

I didn't have an appointment with a patient and I walked into the and a GI was sitting there with a pocket knife, blade open, carving back and forth on his wrist, and I said, you know, I'm going to go sit with this guy. and I said "what kind of knife you got there" and he said "it's a case knife, but it's not very sharp.  And I finaly asked him if I could see the knife, and he handed it to me and I put it in my pocket.  Now that wasn't an appointment, but it damn ure was an encounter, but I think that encounter needs to be entered.  That's a clinical encounter, not an admin encounter.  Past surgeries needs to go under.  Admission summary.. you get admitted to a hopsical.  You visit an outpatioent clineic 

Eyeglasses prescription - goes under progress note

Lab tests and results. Don't I have a lab tests.  Lab test results.  We may get this finished doc.  Progress notes under progress notes.  All right.  Do I need to move that one?  Well there will be no doubt about it. 
I didn't have an appointment with a patient and I walked into the and a GI was sitting there with a pocket knife, blade open, carving back and forth on his wrist, and I said, you know, I'm going to go sit with this guy. and I said "what kind of knife you got there" and he said "it's a case knife, but it's not very sharp.

Past surgeries needs to go under.  Admission summary.. you get admitted to a hopsical.  You visit an outpatioent clineic This is problably some of my button pushig I'm not doing right. Blood pressure under progres notes because that begins every visit.  Well, that really ought to be under labs.  It's done in a clinical setting.  Those need to go in progress notes because they start every session.  Well, like with your physical health, they always take your weight, blood presure and vitals and in the mental health clinic, and in the substance abuste program, we would take values because those guys have really high values, and as they coe down and detox, that's 

Chemotherapy sessions, that would go under progress notes for me.  Height/weight, that's with vitals.  The progress notes is how they quote/unquote progress through the clinic because we're expecting good outcomes.  With some guys, you're just trying to keep them alive another day.  They're not making progress, they're holding on.  In some cases, you're documenting the final moments, but it still goes under progress notes. Pre-visit summary, that's going to go under progress notes. 

Let me think... wish I could go faster up there.  A pre-visit summary uh, is when somebody, yeah, when an ambulatory care doc calls me the addiction specialist and says. Joe I have a patent here that has a of .0 (??).  Well, my doc said I've got all these lab values going crazy and mom doesn't like it.  If the doc says "here, I'm going to give you an appoitnment with the addictoins specialist, those appoinemtns would never happen.  [Need to review video].  Then at 9:15 patient and counselor had an appoinment

I can do past flu shots [moves under completed lab tests] and medications need to be medications [creates a medications category]

## Section 2: Card sort - 15-20 mins (https://bit.ly/mrcardsort)
Now we are going to do a sorting activity. 

This sorting activity is a tool that helps us to understand how Veterans would group certain items. If we can understand how items are grouped, we can then organize them in a way that makes it easier for Veterans to find what they need quickly. For example, if you were to organize a refrigerator, you might put certain food types together - like cheeses - to make it easier for you to find a cheese you like when you need it. 

**Example card sort**
*Preview link for demonstration purposes: https://dj540s05.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/vtqh45gr/sort*

We will be using a website to do the sorting activity. I'll show you how it works. 

First, you'll see this screen on the left that has a list of different cards with information on them. On the right, you can drag items and group them together. Try to think of these groups as broader categories.

We ask folks to organize the cards into different groups that make sense to you. What are the things that different cards have in common? Or that make the groups different from each other? 

For me, looking at these cards on the left, I can organize the "Vanilla ice cream", "Cheddar cheese", and "Milk" cards together. I can rename the group by clicking on the "Click to rename" button at the top of the group - I'll rename this group "Dairy." I can organize "Lettuce" and "Broccoli" into a second group and label that "Vegetables." I have no idea what food group "cotton candy" might belong to, so I could put it in the "I don't know" group. 

If I decide that I don't like a group that I made, I can also click the x in the top righthand side of the box and the cards get returned to the left hand column. 

Do you have any questions at this point? 

**Share Optimal Workshop link with participant**

First, would you mind sharing your screen? To share your screen, please tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

Now I need to share with you a link to the sorting activity. How would you prefer the link to the sorting activity? I could say it out loud for you to put into your browser, or I could put it in the Zoom chat. 
- [Card sort link](https://bit.ly/mrcardsort): https://bit.ly/mrcardsort 


**Instructions to open the card sort:**
* Go to the chat in zoom. It is located at the bottom of this zoom window and looks like a speech bubble.
* Click on the link for the optimal workshop card sort.

*If participant needs extra instructions, or needs instructions to be repeated, use these:* 
* On the left, we have different cards with information about health information. 
* On the right, you can drag items and group them together. Try to think of these groups as broader categories. 
* If you do not recognize what something is on one of the cards, or need me to explain it a bit more, let me know.

* Any questions at this point?

* Organize cards in a way that makes sense to you
	* We will start at the top left and work our way through the cards, while we are moving them, help me out by “thinking out loud” so that I can understand why you might want to group things together.

11. *(As participant puts cards into different groups)*: Can you explain to me what you are thinking as you put *(card name)* and *(card name)* together? Why do those belong together? 

	- *Continue to probe participant to explain their thinking as they group cards.*
	
12. *(Review categories where you would like to understand what participants look for in a given category, like appointments)*: I see you created *(category)*. When you review information in *(category name)*, what data would be most important for you to know? 
	
	- *Example question*: When you review your appointments, what information would be most important for you to know?

13. *PROBE FOR UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENT CARDS AND TERMS, IF PARTICIPANT NOT EXPLAINING. Particularly interested in understanding how users understand technical medical language. Example probes could be:*

	- What do you think "Pathology results" are? 
	- How are you understanding "Radiology results or images"? 
	- What do you think the difference is between "Encounter notes" and "Progress notes"? 

- When complete: Please go ahead and click the finish button so we can save these groupings. It’ll be anonymous. *(If going to use scenarios in Section 2B, wait until you have completed those questions before asking participant to submit their card sort.)*

**Moderator notes:**

- We are not concerned with prioritizing cards within the grouping.

## Section 2B: Grouping like ideas - 15-20 mins

*ASK THESE QUESTIONS IF UNABLE TO DO CARD SORTING ACTIVITY DESCRIBED IN SECTION 2A, OR ASK THESE QUESTIONS IN RELATION TO THE CATEGORIES THE PARTICIPANT CREATED IN SECTION 2A.*

Now I'm going to ask you where you would look for different types of information on a patient portal. When I say "patient portal," I mean a website or app that you can log into and find information about your personal health history, where you can communicate with your healthcare providers, and even where you can make appointments, find care, or pay your healthcare bills, depending on the portal. 

14. *SCENARIO:* Let's say you have diabetes and you want to see your most recent blood sugar levels based off of a blood draw they did the last time you saw your doctor. If you go into your patient portal, where would you look for that information? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* If there was a header, or section of the page where you would expect to find this information, what would that tab be named? 
	
	- What other kind of information would you expect to find there? 

	- *If participant completed card sorting activity in Section 2A*: In which of the categories you created would you look for that information? 

15. *SCENARIO:* Imagine that you have come to one of your patient portals (could be for the VA, or some other provider) looking for information about a diagnosis from a service-related injury that you need to file a disability claim. Where do you think that information would be found?

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* If there was a header, or section of the page where you would expect to find this information, what would that tab be named? 
	
	- What other kind of information would you expect to find there?

	- *If participant completed card sorting activity in Section 2A*: In which of the categories you created would you look for that information?

16. *SCENARIO:* What about if you were looking to find a plan for how your doctor was going to treat a health issue that you have - where would you look for that plan? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* If there was a header, or section of the page where you would expect to find this information, what would that tab be named? 
	
	- What other kind of information would you expect to find there?

	- *If participant completed card sorting activity in Section 2A*: In which of the categories you created would you look for that information?

17. *SCENARIO:* Now imagine that you are trying to find the results of some blood tests that you had done in the past month. Where would you look for that information?  

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* If there was a header, or section of the page where you would expect to find this information, what would that tab be named? 
	
	- What other kind of information would you expect to find there?

	- *If participant completed card sorting activity in Section 2A*: In which of the categories you created would you look for that information?

18. *SCENARIO:* Let's say you are trying to find proof that you have been vaccinated against Yellow Fever so you can travel to a country where that is a required vaccine. Where would you look for that information in a patient portal? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* If there was a header, or section of the page where you would expect to find this information, what would that tab be named? 
	
	- What other kind of information would you expect to find there?

	- *If participant completed card sorting activity in Section 2A*: In which of the categories you created would you look for that information?

19. *SCENARIO:* Imagine that you switched doctors and you needed to give your newest doctor a list of medications that you had taken in the past. Where would you look for that list in a patient portal? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* If there was a header, or section of the page where you would expect to find this information, what would that tab be named? 
	
	- What other kind of information would you expect to find there?

	- *If participant completed card sorting activity in Section 2A*: In which of the categories you created would you look for that information?

## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes
*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

20. *(IF using a screen reader)* If you wanted to share your thoughts on this web page with the VA, how would you do it? *(Feedback button on bottom right of page that's not the home page / ___________)*
     1. Have you *ever* done this before?
     2. If so, how and when?
     3. Could you please go to VA.gov? How would you share your thoughts on this web page?
     4. *(Want to see if screen reader users can/will use the Medallia feedback button)*

21. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 

## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.
