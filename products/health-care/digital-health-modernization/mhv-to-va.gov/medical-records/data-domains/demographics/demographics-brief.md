These standards originated during the Obama administration. MyHealtheVet used to get measured against these standards, and while they no longer do, these standards are still considered best practice and pertain to viewing, downloading, and transmitting.

## Use Cases

**Common Use Cases**

**Edge Cases**



## UX considerations

### When to show Demographics section


**Where do Demographics fit within IA?**



### How to show Demographics section
- What should the screen look like? What information should be seen? What should be hidden? 



**View vs. share vs. download considerations:**


### Research that relates to Demographics

**An "About me/ Personal information" category was often created by participants, though the contents of this category differed.** 

Some versions of this category included demographic information, ongoing monitoring information like vitals, allergies and immunizations, and a "shapshot" of current health, issues, and treatments. Others contained only some of this information. 

<img width="921" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100814257/202789539-f350fbd1-1a4b-482c-81c5-6c23dc70877e.png">

The purpose of this category varied. Some participants framed the category as providing key information to doctors about a patient. 

   - _"[Personal information group is] anything about yourself - age, height, weight. Any information that a doctor needs to know before prescribing medication."_ Female Caregiver, age 39, no MHV account

Others wanted the most pressing or current information to be centrally located - in this way, this category simultaneously functioned similar to a "to do list". 

This category varied the most across interviews and explanations often seemed contradictory and incoherent; however, this category still existed in the majority (n=10) of interviews. It is possible that a different interview guide would have led to participants distinguish more consistently between demographic information, current health status, and most pressing issues. This will be explored in concept testing.
