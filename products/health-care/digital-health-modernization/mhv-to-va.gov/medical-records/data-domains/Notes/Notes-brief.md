## Additional notes

- Notes from Jenny: On BB, this is called "VA Notes", which includes all notes (progress notes, visit summary, procedure messages...). In CCDA, encounter notes, consultation notes and procedure notes are all separated.
  - So this means we need to decide if we separate them out or keep them together and linked with the healthcare interaction/ occurrence to which they pertain. E.g., link notes with clinic visit, surgery/ procedure, etc. OR if we do it some other way? Has backend implications - need to liaise w/ both Jenny and Eric to understand better.
