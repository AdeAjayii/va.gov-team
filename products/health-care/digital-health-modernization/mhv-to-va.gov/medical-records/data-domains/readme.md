* Domains that we hypothesize will be found elsewhere in the portal or in VA.gov. I.e. appointments will be found in “appointments”. Medications will be combined with RX refill to create one medications section that will include a view of all of your meds, plus a view where you can refill/renew va meds. Demographics I think we’re still sussing out, based on that convo in slack last week. Some of it is in VA profile already. Some isn’t.
