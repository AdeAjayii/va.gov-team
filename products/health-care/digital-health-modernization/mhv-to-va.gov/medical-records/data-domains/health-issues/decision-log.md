## Questions to be Answered
1. What term do we want to use for this list? Health Issues? Problem List? Health Conditions? Other?


## MyHealth*e*Vet Functionality Notes
1. Information and disclaimers about the problem list can be found on the [problem list landing page](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/va-problem-list) on MyHeath*e*Vet (requires logging in with a test account).
2. Access to the Problem List on MyHealth*e*Vet requires users to upgrade to a Premium Account. To view the problem list online, you will need to use a test user account that is set up as Premium.
3. There is a 36-hour waiting period before a new problem is included in the Problem list.
4. My VA Health Summary, which also contains a list of problems -- labeled "Problems (Conditions)" -- can be downloaded without a Premium Account.  
5. The problem list within the VA Health Summary is displayed in a tabluar format. Screen shot of on-screen view | PDF example
6. VA Health Summary data is currently updated once a day and may be viewed in the browser, downloaded as a PDF, XML file or sent securely to a health provider via Direct Message.  
7. Users may also set up Email notifications to subscribe to Health Summary delivery notifications.
8. Generating a VA Health Summary is a lengthy process due to the background process that must be run to collect the data.  The browser shows a status and will display links to view, download PDF, Download XML or Send the health summary once the report has been generated. 
9. The Problem list in the VA Health Summary incudes data from the user's date of birth until the date the report is generated.
