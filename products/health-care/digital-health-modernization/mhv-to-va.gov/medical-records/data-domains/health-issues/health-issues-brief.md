# Health Issues Brief

Last updated: January 26, 2023

## Purpose

To serve as a source of truth around data field requirements and specifications, UX considerations, and to document a plan for feedback from SMEs or coordination with other teams. 

## Description of domain

This domain provides Veterans with a summary of the active health concerns contained in their official VA health record.  It is important to note that this data is not currently provided within the MyHealth*e*Vet information architecture.  The only way to access health problems is by generating a Blue Button report or a VA Health Summary Report, and the data provided in these two reports is inconsistent.  The VA Health Summary Report is derived from CCDA (Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture) data and provides the following:
- Problem
- Provider
- Location
- Status
- Date/Time Entered
- Comments

The Blue Button Report is derived from [data] and provides the following:
- Problem
- Status
- Problem Code
- Date on Onset
- Date of Resolution
- Provider
- Source

These standards originated during the Obama administration. MyHealtheVet used to get measured against these standards, and while they no longer do, these standards are still considered best practice and pertain to viewing, downloading, and transmitting.
