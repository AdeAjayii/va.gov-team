# Labs/ Tests: Data fields and UX considerations

Last updated: December 15, 2022

## Purpose

To serve as a source of truth around data field requirements and specifications, UX considerations, and to document a plan for feedback from SMEs or coordination with other teams (e.g., Mobile). 

## Description of domain

Labs and Tests represent health information that may be categorized as lab work results, blood chemistry/hematology results, radiology reports, pathology reports, electrocardiogram (EKG) reports, and self-reported test results, such as blood sugar.

**Edge Cases**



## UX considerations

### When to show Labs/ Tests section


**Where do Labs/ Tests fit within IA?**



### How to show Labs/ Tests section
- The landing page for Labs and Tests should list  


**View vs. share vs. download considerations:**
- When download is offered, we must provide the option to download an accessible document along with PDF
- View means the user can open and view a document on their screen once it has been generated
- The size of some health records are prohibitive to displaying them quickly on-screen


### Accessibility considerations:

- Need to create Accessibility brief/ document -> link here

_Accessibility considerations specific to Labs/ Tests:_


### Research that relates to Labs/ Tests



## Questions to answer

**UX:** 
- Do users expect to find blood sugar, cholesteral (lipid panel) and blood clotting times in their vitals or in their labs and tests?
- Do users expect to find imaging (X-rays, MRI, CT scan) in labs and tests?


**Business/ Engineering:** 
- Is there a business or technical reason we cannot show blood sugar, cholesteral (lipid panel) and blood clotting times with Labs and Tests instead of with Vitals?
- Is there a business or technical reason why Labs and Tests cannot include Microbiology, Electrocardiogram, Pathology Reports
    

**Who do we need to get feedback from?**
 - Business - Patty Henry
 - Technical - TBD


## Lessons learned


## Backlog of potential features/ Ideas Parking Lot
- Connect lab results with a specific visit or encounter
- Connect pathology results with a specific procedure
- Generate files that are compatible with common PHR systems so that they can be uploaded to another provider's system
