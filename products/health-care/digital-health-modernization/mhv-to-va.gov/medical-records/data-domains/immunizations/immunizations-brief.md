# Immunization: Data fields and UX considerations

Last updated: December 8, 2022

## Purpose

To serve as a source of truth around data field requirements and specifications, UX considerations, and to document a plan for feedback from SMEs or coordination with other teams (e.g., Mobile). 

## Description of domain

Immunizations represent vaccines obtained during service and after service. 

## Immunization data fields
(Refer to [Medical Records Domains, Fields, Capabilities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13KE1WhN9c_uG_m-RDEeL3xT0Q50txcBJ_IMt8BxU5II/edit#gid=1602824280) for more detail on data fields.) 

**Data field title:** Immunizations

**Data fields to include:**
- Immunization
- Date received
- Location
- Reaction
- Comments
- Series

## Use Cases

Can either include use case info here or link to another file - depends on how much info. 

## UX considerations

### Immunizations section

**When to show this section:**
- When do users see immunization section in flow?  

**How to show this section:**
- What should the screen look like? What information should be seen? What should be hidden? 

**Accessibility considerations:**


**Where do immunizations fit within IA?**


**View vs. share vs. download considerations:**


## Questions to answer

1. **UX:** Any language considerations? Do users prefer immunizations or vaccinations? What information do they want most readily accessible relating to their immunizations? (Has mobile answered any of those questions?)
2. **Business/ Engineering:** Are we able to change the name of any data fields to make them more intuitive? 

**Who do we need to get feedback from?**

-**Mobile team:** Already done vaccines on mobile app; what lessons have they learned? How do our designs need to align with theirs? 


## Additional notes

- The legacy MHV allows users to contribute patient generated data (e.g., when users get a flu shot). This domain represents an opportunity to determine the role of patient-generated health data (PGHD). While incorporating PGHD is not feasible in the MVP, this represents a backlog feature in which we might enable integration with other systems to pull in data (e.g., from a CVS pharmacy where users obtain vaccines) or in which users might contribute data.
