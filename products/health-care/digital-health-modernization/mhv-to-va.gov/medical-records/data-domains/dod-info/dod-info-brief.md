# Department of Defense (DoD): Data fields and UX considerations

Last updated: January 31, 2023

## Purpose

To serve as a source of truth around data field requirements and specifications, UX considerations, and to document a plan for feedback from SMEs or coordination with other teams. 

## Description of domain

- Data Source: DEERS

- The three test accounts we have access to do not have DoD information in their data so that we can see an example of the data, even when searching 1895 to present.  We will work to obtain this data through a different source.

These standards originated during the Obama administration. MyHealtheVet used to get measured against these standards, and while they no longer do, these standards are still considered best practice and pertain to viewing, downloading, and transmitting.
