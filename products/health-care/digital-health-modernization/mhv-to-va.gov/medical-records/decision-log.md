| 09/09/2022 | Lauren Alexanderson, Marci McGuire, Coulton Bunney                   |  We will bring engineering and design in earlier than we did with secure messaging                       |  rapid technical feedback will be more important in this application. |
| 09/22/2022 | Lauren Alexanderson, Marci McGuire, Coulton Bunney      | We will likely start with immunizations first in the Medical Records app.| Should be straightforward compared to other sections        |

## Consider designing an experience that allows users to view,  print/download, and share immunizations.

**Other approaches considered:**  We also considered having a print functionality (leaving the sharing and downloading to the proposed “Medcial Records” section of the IA/expereince). Sharing an individual immunization may be more of an edge case. However, we wanted to surface and explore the possibility of electronically sharing individual records as it may be more of use case for “labs and tests.” 

**Pro:** In generative research: Viewing, sharing, downloading/printing functionality was desired. 

**Pro:** Provides autonomy and ownership of the records to the user. 

**Con:** The workflow to electronically share may be confusing to users. It may be overcomplicating the experience by over engineering/designing the workflow. Keeping in mind, there will always be a place to download and electronically share your medical records in this expereince.  

**Con:** There may be policy issues with sharing indivdual records. 

## Does the VA have any stance on the terms Vaccines or Immunizations? 

**Danielle Thierry (OCTO content and translation lead) stated in Slack:**

To date, we've decided on "vaccines" on modernized pages mainly for simplicity. The Veterans Health Library and public health site both go with   "Vaccines and immunization," as do the WHO and others. Both terms have high search volume so there's definitely an element of recognition for both and we've discussed that in the past as a potential option. Our current IA tree test for the health apartment has "vaccines" so we should get some data around that and we can continue to test further. 

**Pro:** “VA Vaccine” is consistent with the with VA Flagship Mobile app 

**Recommendation:** Continue working with the content and IA team to determine the best approach
