# MHV to VA.gov Product Onboarding Quick Start Guide
Last Update: August 26, 2022

This guide touches the highlights in the overall [VA.gov onboarding process](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/), but is not a substitute for that document.  Always defer to the VA Platform documentation for the most complete and current information.  

## Admin Info
Before you get started with onboarding, there are a few key pieces of information that you will need:
1. Name of your Program Manager
2. Name of your OCTO-DE Product Owner
3. Name of your VA Business Owner
4. A GitHub account.  Almost all orientation-related requests and related correspondence happen in GitHub, so you'll to [create an account](https://github.com/join) before proceeding. *You don't need a VA.gov email address assigned to create the account, but once you have your VA email, add it to your GitHub account so you won't be removed from the repo*
5. GitHub Handle - After creating a GitHub account, make note of your GitHub handle (user name).  You will need to provide this in your orientation request.  Please be aware that 
6. Name of your contract
7. Name of the COR (Contracting Officer's Representative) on your contract and their email address
8. Team name - You and your Product Owner should decide on a name before proceeding.  If this is a brand-new team, you or your Product Owner will need to create a [new VFS Team Request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=governance-team%2C+analytics-insights&template=new-vfs-team.md&title=New+VFS+Team+%5BInsert+team+name+here%5D)
9. Team members' start dates - Each team member will need to know their employment start date for their orientation request
10. Team slack channel - please work with your Product Owner, who may already have created a channel

## Communication
Most day-to-day communications between VA.gov product team members happens in Slack.  Questions and feedback on specific GitHub requests often take place within the comments of the GitHub issue itself. Surveys and announcements about upcoming changes are also posted in Slack in the #vfs-all-teams channel. In general, email is used for discussions with the VA or a vendor.

## VA Platform Website
The [VA Platform website](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/) is a valuable resource that contains the most current information about onboarding to the VA.gov platform, as well as recommended Slack channels, processes, documentation, and instructions for getting access to the tools and systems you will need.


## Platform Orientation
All team members working on a VA.gov project must complete an orientation request and should attend general and practice-specific orientation sessions. 

- [Platform Orienation Request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=governance-team%2C+analytics-insights%2C+analytics-request&template=orientation-epic.md&title=Platform+Orientation+Template+%5BYour+name+here%5D) - This request kicks off some processes for granting you access to the GitHub repos. Be sure to complete all fields in the request and *be on the lookout for an email from an admin via GitHub. If you don't respond within a few days, your request will be archived.*

    - [Welcome](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/welcome)
    - [Orientation](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/platform-orientation)

## Getting Access to Tools
- The VA Platform site has detailed instructions on the [tools you will need](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/platform-tools) and [how to request access to each](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/request-access-to-tools).
- One of the tools you'll be requesting is GitHub.  It will also simplify your ability to track work and communicate with other VA.gov teams if you  connect your GitHub account to a [ZenHub account](https://www.zenhub.com/).  ZenHub runs in the browser on top of GitHub, or you can install a plug in on Chrome or Firefox.

## VA Platform Collaboration Cycle
As products and new features are developed for VA.gov, they go through a process called the Collaboration Cycle, where teams get feedback and guidance on their work to ensure it meets VA.gov experience standards.  Each member of the team should become familiar with the process and understand team responsbilities, Platform expectations, and required artifacts.

Please note that set up instructions may differ if your laptop/desktop is GFE (Government-Furnished Equipment).  Please work with your engineering lead on any GFE-related issues you encounter.

## Offboarding
If a member of the team leaves the contract, they should submit an [offboarding request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=analytics-insights%2C+Offboarding%2C+operations&template=offboarding-request.md&title=Offboarding+of+%5Bindividual%5D).  If they have already left, their HR manager, Product Manager, Product Owner, or Program Director can submit one on their behalf.
