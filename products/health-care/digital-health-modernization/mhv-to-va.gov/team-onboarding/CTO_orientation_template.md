### Background history 

- Early 1970s - the National Center for Health Services Research and Development, a component of the U.S. Public Health Service, began planning for development of what would become Electronic Health Records (EHR). 
- 1977 - VA Massachusetts General Hospital Utility Multi-Programming System (MUMPS), a precursor to VistA, was developed by the Computer Assisted System Staff (CASS) Team
- Early 1980s -  VA made its software available without restriction in the public domain to other government and private sector organizations, in compliance with the Freedom of Information Act. VA recognized this opportunity to support widespread EHR adoption and offered use of VistA as the standard-bearer for EHR implementation around the world
- June 1981 - VA MUMPS was renamed the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program (DHCP), and VA Administrator Robert Nimmo joined Rep. G.V. "Sonny" Montgomery to establish DHCP as VA's Medical Information System Development Program to formalize its organization and management.
- December 1981 - Congressman Sonny Montgomery arranges for the DHCP to be written into law as VA's medical-information systems development program. VA Administrator Robert P. Nimmo followed up on February 18, 1982 with an Executive Order describing how the DHCP was to be organized and managed within VA's Department of Medicine and Surgery.
- 1990 - VistA, VA's first image management system, provided VA physicians with immediate access to patient medical images, regardless of location. VistA first became operational at the Washington, D.C. VA Medical Center (VAMC) to manage radiologic, pathology, gastroenterology, and laparoscopic images, as well as electrocardiograms.
- 1994 - VA's Under Secretary for Health, Kenneth W. Kizer, M.D., renames DHCP as VistA, the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture.
- 2003 - VA launches My HealtheVet nationwide on Veterans Day 2003. The personal health record portal now has over 2.5 million registered users.
- 2015 - DOD awarded a $3.4 billion contract to Cerner Corporation for new electronic health record system.
- 2017 - VA decides to acquire the same Cerner system as DOD
- 2018 - VA awards contract to Cerner
- 2021 - Cerner deployed at Spokane Washington VA Medical Center (VAMC)
- Mar - Jun 2022 - Cerner deployed at four more VAMCs (Walla Walla, WA; Columbus, OH; Roseburg, OR; White City, OR)
- Oct 2022 - VA announced it would delay upcoming deployments of its new EHR until June 2023 to address challenges with the system and make sure it is functioning optimally for Veterans and VA health care personnel. 
- Nov 2022 - a memorandum was signed by
