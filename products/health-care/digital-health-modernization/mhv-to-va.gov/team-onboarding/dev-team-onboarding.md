# MHV to VA.gov Team Member Onboarding Guide

## Admin Info
Before you get started with onboarding, there are a few key pieces of information that you will need:
1. Name of your Program Manager
2. Name of your OCTO-DE Product Owner
3. Name of your VA Business Owner
4. A GitHub account.  Almost all orientation-related requests and related correspondence will be done in GitHub, so you must [create an account](https://github.com/join) before proceeding. *You do not need to have a VA.gov email address assigned to create the account, but once you do have one, it must be added to your account to prevent it from being deactivated.*
5. GitHub Handle - After creating a GitHub account, make note of your GitHub handle (user name).  Each team member will need to provide this in their orientation request.
6. Name of your contract
8. Team name - this is the name you will call your new VFS (Veteran-Facing Services) team.  You and your Product Owner should decide on a name before proceeding.  If this is a brand-new team, you or your Product Owner will need to create a [new VFS Team Request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=governance-team%2C+analytics-insights&template=new-vfs-team.md&title=New+VFS+Team+%5BInsert+team+name+here%5D)
9. Team members' start dates - Each team member will need to know their employment start date for their orientation request.

## Communication
Much of the day-to-day communication between VA.gov product teams is done in Slack.  Conversation about specific GitHub requests may also take place within the context of the GitHub issue itself.

## VA Platform Website
The [VA Platform website](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/) is a valuable resource that contains the most current information about onboarding to the VA.gov platform, as well as processes, documentation, and info on getting access to the tools you will need.


## Platform Orientation
All team members working on a VA.gov project must complete an orientation request and attend general and practice-specific orientation sessions. 

- [Platform Orienation Request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=governance-team%2C+analytics-insights%2C+analytics-request&template=orientation-epic.md&title=Platform+Orientation+Template+%5BYour+name+here%5D) - This request kicks off some processes for granting you access to the GitHub repos. Be sure to complete all fields in the request and **be on the lookout for an email from an admin via GitHub.** If you don't respond within a few days, your request will be archived.

## Getting Access to Tools
- The VA Platform site has detailed instructions on the [tools you will need](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/platform-tools) and [how to request access to each](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/request-access-to-tools).

## VA Platform Collaboration Cycle
As products and new features are developed for VA.gov, they go through a process called the Collaboration Cycle, where teams get feedback and guidance on their work to ensure it meets VA.gov experience standards.  Each member of the team should familiarize themselves with this process and understand responsbilities, platform expectations, and required artifacts.

## Engineering-Specific Info
Please note that set up instructions may differ if your laptop/desktop is GFE (Government-Furnished Equipment).  Please work with your engineering lead on any GFE-related issues you encounter.

## Offboarding
If a member of the team leaves the contract, they should submit an [offboarding request](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=analytics-insights%2C+Offboarding%2C+operations&template=offboarding-request.md&title=Offboarding+of+%5Bindividual%5D)  If they have already left, their HR manager, Product Manager, Product Owner, or Program Director can submit one on their behalf.
