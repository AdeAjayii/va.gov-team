# MHVC feedback sessions: Medications
## January 2024 

## Takeaways  
- The majority of support they give is with MHV on web, they rarely get questions about other pharmacy apps like RxRefill or VAHB App.
- The majority of veterans who come to them about pharmacy are looking to refill a medication and asking why a medication is not showing up.
- Coordinators have varying experiences and levels of training when troubleshooting medications with a veteran.
- Their biggest concern is the transition to va.gov and helping veterans login and verify their identity.
