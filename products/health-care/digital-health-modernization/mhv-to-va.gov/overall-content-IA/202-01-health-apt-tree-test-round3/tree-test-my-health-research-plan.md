# Research Plan for My health IA, January 2023

## Background

Based on the previous tree test findings, the team iterated on the information architecture for the health hub and health apartment. As the team considers how to properly include the Health Apartment on VA.gov to ensure Veterans and Caregivers to get and manage their health care benefits, this research will help inform decisions on the information architecture of the health apartment and how it links to the broader VA.gov structure.

## OCTO Objectives

This effort supports the following OCTO objectives:
- Veterans and their caregiver/families can easily find information on benefits applications and apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged in users have a personalized experience, with features that saves them time and energy in applying and managing benefits

## Veteran Journey

Veteran tasks fit in the following key points in the Veteran journey:
- Primary – Starting up and Taking care of myself
- Secondary – Putting down roots, Retiring, Aging

## Research Goals

The goal of this research is to gather quantitative insights on the information architecture for the proposed My health patient portal section of VA.gov.  We will be looking to better understand how labeling and organization of the menus impact users’ ability to successfully complete tasks.

In these tree tests, we will aim to:

- Evaluate the findability of various information within the "My Health" structure
- Evaluate if participants understand what to find under "Health history" vs "Medical records"
- Gain insights on what information participants expect to find with an appointment vs with health history or medical records
 

## Outcome

We will use the insights from this research to validate and refine the information architecture for the health apartment. It will also help identify what additional research needs are and help inform the roadmap for the continued health apartment work.

## Research Questions

Can Veterans and their families/caregivers navigate the proposed information architecture of the My health patient portal in order to find information and complete key tasks as they manage their VA health care?

## Hypothesis

- Veterans will look for after visit summaries with the corresponding appointment
- Veterans will know to look with "Health history" to find information on medical images and vitals
- Veterans will look for historical prescription information under the "Prescriptions" section rather than in health history or medical records
- Veterans will know what information is under health history versus medical records
- Veterans will be able to find general information about a Veteran's health care benefits under a "My health benefits"

 
## Method

This phase of the research is designed to validate the refined information architecture and to see if the key tasks can be completed successfully by participants.

### IA Tree Test (remote, unmoderated)

Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a tree test activity that contains 8 tasks. For each task, the participant will locate in the tree where a specific task can be completed.

### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Optimal Workshop.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information (whether the Veteran has used MyHealtheVet before; whether the Veteran uses VA healthcare) on a [folder on the sensitive repo](set up and link). We want to have a meeting with Perigean before recruitment begins to make sure there is no confusion with criteria table and screener questions. 

## Recruitment criteria

We will invite a total of 54 participants for a completion rate of 40 tree tests.

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.

## Appendix A: Tasks

### Tasks 

The prioritized tasks, linked to our testing objective, were carefully curated such that they reflect how Veterans might naturally approach the website. We ensured that the answer wasn't given away by using the same language that’s in the tree itself, and we used plain language to write the tasks. Below, the parentheticals describe the general goal of the task.

**Veteran tasks**
- You saw your primary care provider last month and want to review what was decided for next steps in your care.  
- Your primary care doctor asked you to fill out some forms online before your visit next week.
- You want to know the name of the prescription that you stopped taking last summer for a skin condition.
- You want to find the results of a recent MRI you had done.
- You want to know what your blood pressure was the last time you had it taken by your primary care physician.
- You want to get a copy of your VA health records for your personal files.
- You need to order new batteries for your hearing aid.
- You recently lost your ID card for your Veteran health care and need to get a new one.
