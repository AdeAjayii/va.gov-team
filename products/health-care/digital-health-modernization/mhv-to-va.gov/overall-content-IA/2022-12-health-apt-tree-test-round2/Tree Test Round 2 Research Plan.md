# Research Plan for Health Apartment IA, November 2022

## Background

Based on the previous tree test findings, the team iterated on the information architecture for the health hub and health apartment. As the team considers how to properly include the Health Apartment on VA.gov to ensure Veterans and Caregivers to get and manage their health care benefits, this research will help inform decisions on the information architecture of the health apartment and how it links to the broader VA.gov structure.

## OCTO Objectives

This effort supports the following OCTO objectives:
- Veterans and their caregiver/families can easily find information on benefits applications and apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged in users have a personalized experience, with features that saves them time and energy in applying and managing benefits

## Veteran Journey

Veteran tasks fit in the following key points in the Veteran journey:
- Primary – Starting up and Taking care of myself
- Secondary – Putting down roots, Retiring, Aging

## Research Goals

The goal of this research is to gather qualitative insights on the information architecture for the health hub and the health apartment that was modified based on the previous tree testing. We will be looking to better understand how labeling, and organization of the menus impact users’ ability to successfully complete tasks.

We will have two sets of key tasks for Veterans, families/caregivers. We will not only test the information architecture of the health care hub and health apartment, but also test the deeper structure of the site navigation, such as the left navigation.

- Evaluate the usability of navigation in and between get health care benefits and My Health sections
- Evaluate the location of health care benefits programs (mental and dental care) as core health care information
- Evaluate “My Health” as a replacement label for the manage benefits spoke/section of the health care hub
- Evaluate whether users can easily manage their health with the categories under “My Health”
- Evaluate whether the logged in experience for family members and caregivers is sufficient to help manage Veterans’ health on their behalf.

## Outcome

We will use the insights from this research to validate and refine the information architecture for the health apartment and health hub. It will also identify what additional research needs are and help inform the roadmap for the continued health apartment work.

## Research Questions

Can users navigate proposed changes to VA.gov and to find information and complete key tasks as they get and/or manage their VA health care benefits?

## Hypothesis

- Veterans who have health care benefits account will go to My Health directly for finding information and managing health.
- Grouping all health care benefits programs will help Veterans and caregivers and families easily find benefits information for their needs.
- Viewing different categories for health history can help Veterans quickly locate their health information.
 
## Method & Tools

This phase of the research is designed to validate the refined information architecture and to see if the key tasks can be completed successfully by participants.

### IA Tree Tests (remote, unmoderated)

Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a tree test activity that contains, ? tasks for a Veteran and ? tasks for Caregivers and family members that they may experience when getting or managing their health care benefits. For each task, the participant will locate in the tree where a specific task can be completed.
We would like to get complete responses from at least 50 Veterans.
How many people we need to send emails to?
