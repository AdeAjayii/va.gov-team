# Research Plan for Health Apartment IA, November 2022

## Background

Based on the previous tree test findings, the team iterated on the information architecture for the health hub and health apartment. As the team considers how to properly include the Health Apartment on VA.gov to ensure Veterans and Caregivers to get and manage their health care benefits, this research will help inform decisions on the information architecture of the health apartment and how it links to the broader VA.gov structure.

## OCTO Objectives

This effort supports the following OCTO objectives:
- Veterans and their caregiver/families can easily find information on benefits applications and apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged in users have a personalized experience, with features that saves them time and energy in applying and managing benefits

## Veteran Journey

Veteran tasks fit in the following key points in the Veteran journey:
- Primary – Starting up and Taking care of myself
- Secondary – Putting down roots, Retiring, Aging

## Research Goals

The goal of this research is to gather qualitative insights on the information architecture for the health hub and the health apartment that was modified based on the previous tree testing. We will be looking to better understand how labeling, and organization of the menus impact users’ ability to successfully complete tasks.

We will have two sets of key tasks for Veterans, families/caregivers. We will not only test the information architecture of the health care hub and health apartment, but also test the deeper structure of the site navigation, such as the left navigation.

- Evaluate the usability of navigation in and between get health care benefits and My Health sections
- Evaluate the location of health care benefits programs (mental and dental care) as core health care information
- Evaluate “My Health” as a replacement label for the manage benefits spoke/section of the health care hub
- Evaluate whether users can easily manage their health with the categories under “My Health”
- Evaluate whether family members and caregivers can navigate the information architecture to get and apply for benefits themselves.
- Evaluate whether family members and caregivers can find information and manage Veterans' health on their behalf. 

## Outcome

We will use the insights from this research to validate and refine the information architecture for the health apartment and health hub. It will also identify what additional research needs are and help inform the roadmap for the continued health apartment work.

## Research Questions

Can Veterans and their families/caregivers navigate proposed changes to VA.gov and to find information and complete key tasks as they get and/or manage their VA health care benefits?

## Hypothesis

- Veterans who have health care benefits account will go to My Health directly for finding information and managing health instead of browsing on VA.gov.
- Grouping and prioritizing all health care benefits programs (such as mental health and dental insurance) will help Veterans and caregivers and families easily find benefits information for their needs.
- Viewing popular categories for medical records instead of downloading the full records can help Veterans quickly locate their health information.
- Families and caregivers might prefer to find their benefits under family hub.
 
## Method & Tools

This phase of the research is designed to validate the refined information architecture and to see if the key tasks can be completed successfully by participants.

### IA Tree Tests (remote, unmoderated)

Using Optimal Workshop, we will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will be sent a link to a tree test activity that contains, ? tasks for a Veteran and ? tasks for Caregivers and family members that they may experience when getting or managing their health care benefits. For each task, the participant will locate in the tree where a specific task can be completed.
We would like to get complete responses from at least 50 Veterans.
How many people we need to send emails to?

## Participants and recruitment

Ask Perigean to recruit 189 people using the cohorts below in order to get at least 25-50 completes. Ideally, we would like to have:

* 1/7 of recruited participants Veterans' family members or caregivers who help a Veteran manage their VA health care (21)
* 6/7 of participants are Veterans (162)
    * 54 are enrolled in VA health care and have used MyHealtheVet online health management tool within the last year.
    * 27 are enrolled in VA health care and have not used MyHealtheVet online health managemnt tool or have not done so in the last year  
    * 27 are not enrolled in VA healthcare but are enrolled in at least one other VA benefit (i.e. disability compensation, disability pension, education).
    * 54 are not enrolled in enrolled in VA health care and are not enrolled / recieving another VA benefit
* We want to ensure we research with the following underserved Veteran populations:
    * Females 
    * Minorities 
    * Lower education
    * LGTBQAI2S+
    * Cognitive disorder
    * _Candidates may meet several secondary criteria so long as a minimum number of identified underserved Veteran populations identified in spreadsheet are represented in the data pool._
