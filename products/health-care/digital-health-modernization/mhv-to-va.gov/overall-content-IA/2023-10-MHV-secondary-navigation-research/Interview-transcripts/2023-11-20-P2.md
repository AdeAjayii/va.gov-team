Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
M: Let’s start with a few questions...
Do you normally use your phone, desktop, or laptop to do health-related activities on VA.gov?
P: It depends - for health records and prescriptions i use my computer for benefits i use my phone with the app
P: confirms she is using her phone today

Tell me about the last time you used it. When was that? What did you use it for?
P: Maybe 3 months ago I needed to do a refill my prescription and i wasn't home so i went on the phone and did it on my healthy vet


Interview - 50 minutes

M: Before I give you the task, talk me through what you are seeing on the screen - where does it make you think you are on the site?
I see myhealthy vet and this is the appointment screen
j: prompts scroll - sees medications etc
LL: not sure she saw the header
i see my va benefits and then links
and resources and in the spotlight
LL: we aren't we seeing the header on the screen - not sure if she scrolled down or not

Task 1a - MR and SM
M: Imagine that you were recently put on blood thinner medication. Your doctor ordered blood tests two weeks after you started the medication to make sure that it is working. How would you go about seeing those results? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking.

p: to review my lab test results I would go to health records and click on lab test resutls - then I'd go find the results I'm looking for
j: reminds the task - 
p: i would look for complete blood count
p: clicks on details link
p: i can print or download or scroll through and look at the results
j: asks - are you on the right page - she says ye
p: I want to go to provider notes to see what the provider put on there
->follow up is she looking for the label provider notes?


Task 1b - MR and SM
M: Let's say that you're not sure what the results mean because of the medical terminologies and you want to ask your doctor about it. Using the resources offered on this website, how would you go about doing that? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking

p: I would go back out to main
taps on menu
then tapped on in this section
then tapped on Medical records breadcrumb
p: goes back to main page because she wants to send a secure message
p: I'd tap on send a new message
p" that's funny it went back to complete blood count"
LL: error in prototype
find another way to get to messaging
taps main menu
went to inbox there is a link to start a new message

After participant finishes the task:

•	What was helpful, and what wasn’t? Why?
o	LL: remind Jenny - what IF ANYTHING was helpful or unhelpful
o	"its self explanatory to me - everything is right there"

Is this something you would normally do
p: yes if I wanted to find results I'd go to the doctors notes

Task 2 - Appointments
For the next task, you need to make a new appointment with your new doctor, but you don't remember their name. You can check their name from your recent appointment visit. How would you would you go about finding their name on this website?

p: need to get back out of here
p: when I tap my healthevet it doesn't do anything
Jenny redirects her to prototype back button

p: I would go back to health records
I would click on - pauses - is that what I want to do - i could go to health records and look at my last visit
i should be able to look at appoingmtents
VA appointments tapped on
Tries schedule and manage your appointments
Prototype Issue - no upcoming appointments shown
list of my appointments - since it says manage i should be able to cancel or reschedule
jenny clarifies - what do you expect to see - she says my appointments - and recent appointments
I just went back to the main pages because its easier - 
j probes - what is easier - 
p: its easier to go back to the main screen instead of looking around on the main page to see things


Task 3 - Medications
M: Imagine that you have taken a medication named TACROLIMUS for a while, and you want to check the expiration date for ordering refills for TACROLIMUS. How do you go about doing that from here?

Goes to medication main card
taps refill va prescriptions
once you look at your list
its supposed to tell you when it expires
taps tacrolimus link
it has all the information here - it says order refills by this prescriptions date
j: is this something you'd normally do - look for expiration date?
She says yes (LL: but this is a leading question)

Task 4 - MR
M: Imagine you have an overseas trip coming up, and you need to download all your vaccines to prove that you're safe to travel. Where would you go to do that?

scrolls back up I'm going back to the main screen
taps "in this section" button
I want to go to medical records
Jenny probes on "in this section" menu
J: why did you click on this - 
p: I want to go to medical records and medical records was right there
p: I looked at it and thought let me click on this to see what is under there
p: i'd scroll down to vaccines and then go to vaccines and it has all of them - I'd push print or download
normally I'm not downloading vaccines but my medical portion
5 its easy - its self explanatory
j prompts re: why did you want to go back to the mhv main page
p: phone and computer is different
i can see more on my computer screen than phone
it was easier to go back to the "main menu"
j probes - from vaccines what do you think the in this section will do
P: do something else pertaining to this vaccine section
[responds to in this section menu] "I don't understand what that has to do with vaccines"
J says what do you think this list belongs to ?
This belongs to medical records - different areas under medical records
I don't think that link should be leading to this
j probes - see the menu on the very top - what do you think the difference is between that menu and the in this section
p: top is menu for overall site
j: what is overall site - 
p: secure messaging, prescriptions, if you go back to that home page it should be those same things that were on the home page
LL: thinks overall site is MHV only?
j asks - what did you struggle with
LL: lets reframe that question - what IF ANYTHING did you find difficult
p - i didn't struggle - I know my healthevet so I didn't struggle with anything
L probes: you said you were familiar with MyHealthyVet - does this feel familiar to you? 
p: Yes like MHV I'm used to
