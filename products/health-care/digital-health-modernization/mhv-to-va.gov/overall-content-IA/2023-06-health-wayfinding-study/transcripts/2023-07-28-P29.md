# Warm-up questions
* **What kind of device are you using today?** (_Computer / Tablet / Smartphone_)
  * P:  Laptop
* **What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA?**
  * P: Only healthcare

# Task 1: AVS task

P: Would I need to create an account?

**M: What if you have an account?** 

P: Then maybe I'd search. (_scroll and read the top tasks section of the home page_) I would either sign in or click on My VA. (_sign in with MHV account log in_)

**M: What are you looking at?**

P: Ok, claims and appeal, but that's not what I'm looking for. (_click MHV and read through each card_) I will look in the inbox because I don't see anything on here that's about my visit. (_click inbox_) Oh, wait, here's the appointment (_click sec nav. and click into details of the first upcoming appointment) I don't see any notes on here. I'd go to medical records (_click sec nav._) Then Care summaries and notes (_click first AVS and read and scroll, click treatment plan and read_) 

**M: Would you want to or expect to learn more about this appointment?** 

P: No this is already very detailed. I don't have any more questions about the appointment.
