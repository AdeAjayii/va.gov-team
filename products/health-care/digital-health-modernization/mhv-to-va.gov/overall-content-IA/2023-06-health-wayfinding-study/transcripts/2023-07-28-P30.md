# Task 1: AVS

**M: I'd like you to imagine that you recently had a visit with a specialist to talk about a chronic condition. You want to review what was decided. For the next steps in your care. Using this prototype, where would you go for this information?**

P: Well I know like normally I would go to if there's a quick link but I already know through my previous experience. With the old website, you have to sign in first. So I would go to sign in. And then I don't use any of those ones. I always use MHV, cause it's just easier. I use it the most and it's easier to remember. And I don't know if I have access to the other logins. (_sign in and land on My VA, signed in it MHV_) 

**M: What are you looking for here, what words?**

P: I'm looking for reports or tests. (_opened main nav. and clicked on lab and tests result on the main nav._) 

**M: Can you tell me where you are now?**

P: Now it's showing me actual blood draws and things like that, so it's not what I want. I'd go to MR. I don't want to manage them, I don't want to download or share them, so it's care summaries and notes (_scroll on MR landing page_). The admission discharge? not working. (_click AVS and scroll and read_) The reason for the appointment was hypertension. And so these are the thing. So I was diagnosed with so well it looks like I should not smoke and I should definitely take vitamin D. I'm trying to see if it says. Nope, there are just some medications. Oh, treatment plan? Let's try that. I'm gonna get some imaging. Trying to find where are my care instructions. I would think they'd be here because of the treatment plan, but that's more of the doctor's treatment plan in the hospital. It looks like not. What I should do. I don't know where to go from here. That's it. That's all I see.

**M: So do you feel that you've accomplished your goal of seeing that recap of what your doctor told you were your next steps?**

P: No, I don't. Because it's not just like. The patient will now take vitamin D and stop smoking. I feel like it's 50% there because oh I'm going to have a rheumatology consult. And I can see the reasons why, or the diagnosis. Maybe that's leading to the issue. But I was expecting to maybe see a more just. Layman's terms were written out of like What the doctor recommended to me to do.

**M: So this is a summary of your doctor's recommendations for the next steps in your care. Came out of an interaction you had, right?**

P: Yes, sometimes there's a lot that we go over and it could be more than one thing that I asked him about, and in maybe like 30 min or an hour's time of an appointment. I might not remember everything that they recommended, or that we discussed.

**M: Where would you find that?**

P: I would look for it in my medical notes. In my actual medical record or here where it says care summary notes, cause that sounds like what it would be.

# Task 2: Copay & Disability Claims

**M: Using this website, how would you go doing these things?**

P: I'm still on the page I was looking at my healthcare stuff, so I would maybe just go to the main home link. Cause that would be the fastest way. And then I can check on my appeal, status right here. And then also Let's see if they have it there (_checking the top tasks section of VA.gov home page, then click main nav._) Check disability first, and then I'd sign in "check disability and appeal page. And here are my claims. Let's see how I'm doing. Looking at all claims and appeals. Okay, look at that one. Okay. So that's it. I would see like it's still an initial view. So I'm done checking that. 

**M: You feel like you have accomplished the goals?**

P: Yes, I do.

**M: Ok, let's look at the other goal**

P: Let's go back to the home page (_click VA logo_). It's just easier. I'm looking for payment or debt. 

**M: And where are you now?**

P: Right now I'm at the, I'm at the whole menu and I'm using the dropdown. From the first that I've been using since the beginning. That says VA benefits and healthcare. So maybe it's not going to be there because it's not a benefit. Paying bills, let's see, maybe it's healthcare. Because it's paying my, prescription bill maybe. But I don't see it here either. So I don't think it would be in any of these other ones. Then, I will look down here at this menu of quick links (_mid-section of VA home page_) Nope, not here. Maybe I can go to the My VA. (_click My VA_) Here it is, outstanding debts, that took a while to find.
