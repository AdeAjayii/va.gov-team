(_Prototype failed to work, so M navigated on her side with P28's instructions_) 

# Task 1: AVS task
**M: Where would you expect to find information from your doctor about the next steps in your care?** 

P: (_Scroll_) I don't see anything. I would search "report". 

**M: What would you normally do?**

P: Let's log into MHV. Usually, after I log in with MHV login information, it lands on the MHV page, and it doesn't show VA.gov. 

**M: Okay (on My VA now), now what would you do from here?** 

P: Let's click on the menu and see what options it gives us

**M: Why menu?** 

P: It should give me overview of everything that's available. I would go to "VA benefits and health care" because it's for my doctor. (_click health care_) I'm looking for notes doctor put in, but don't see anything. Then, maybe send a secure message. 

**M: What else would you do?**

P: (_scroll_) Let's click on "Get your VA medical records and lab and test results". 

**M: Where are you now?** 

P: On medical records, then I'd go to Care summaries and notes. 

**M: What you looking at here?** 

P: 15 records here, which I hope the most recent should be the first one. Then I'd click on details to see the notes. 

**M: What you looking at here?** 

P: It tells me when I went and which clinic I went to. (_sroll_) Under the time (9:50), it says details. Click on details it should give me notes. 

**M: What else can you learn?** 

P: Labs...everything happened during visit. (_click on treatment plan_) This is not notes though, just basic information.
