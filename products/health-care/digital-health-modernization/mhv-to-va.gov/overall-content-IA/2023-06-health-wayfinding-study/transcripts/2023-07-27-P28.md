# Warm-up questions

  * P:  iPad
* **What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA?**
  * P: Disability and healthcare

(_Prototype failed to work, so M navigated on her side with P28's instructions_) 

# Task 1: AVS task
* **M: Where would you expect to find information from your doctor about next steps in your care?** 
* P: Let's see, I think I would have to sign in. Because if its specifically me its hopefully not public I would sign in and get a different screen?
* **M: How would you sign in?**
* P: Um this button right here (*clicks sign-in button*)
* **M: Okay, go ahead and click it. This is a fake sign-in page so feel free to just click anywhere on these pages.** 
* P: Let's see umm maybe this one My HealtheVet (*referring to the sign-in options on the modal*).
* **M: is that the one you use normally?** 
* P: No, (*laughs*) I usually see a link and I am not sure what these are. Are all 4 of these logins the same?
* **M: No, they are different**
* P: Okay, so I clicked in and now I can see that my name is Hector Garcia. Right?
* **M: That's correct.** 
* P: Okay, so I see some claims. I don't want claims, I'm looking for something from my doctor. Oh wait
