# Task 1: AVS task

P: So, normally I go to My Chart to find my health information. Now, on here, I'd question where I can go to find the equivalent. (_srolls the whole home page, look at top tasks_) Here is "get VA medical records", but I don't want to see the whole records. I'm curious about what's under the "VA benefits and health care" (_main navigation_). It's still not obvious where I'd go for that information. (_clicked "all health care" and scrolls_) I guess I would click on "Get medical records" since that's the only thing that makes sense. Ok, this makes sense. (_clicked on care notes and summaries_) I would expect it to be more prominent on the home page. 

**M: Where are you now?**

P: (_read through everything on the care notes and summaries page_) 

**M: Do you think you'd find the next steps in your care on this page??**

P: Hm, "primary care after visit summary" doesn't sound like it's what you told me to do. 

**M: Can you read more about the AVS from here?**

P: Well, I'd click on "details". (_read everything on the page, and click on treatment plan_) 

**M: If you'd like to know more about this appointment, what would you do?**

P: It seems pretty clear that everything talked about in the appointment is here. If I still want to know more, I would probably message my provider if I don't find anything on the AVS details page.

**M: Do you think you're logged in at this point?**

P: I would think so. This is all my information. Also, there's no long a "sign in" button on top. There's a person's name "Jesse". So, yeah, I'd think I'm logged in. 

**M: Can you go back to the care notes and summaries page?**

P: (_clicked on "back to" breadcrumbs"_) This feels pretty intuitive to click on that for a website. 

**M: How can you learn more about that appointment?**

P: I would just click into details of AVS again, but I don't think it would give me more information than what I have already looked at. 

# Task 2: Copay & Claims 

P: I would go to Billing or Health care. (_clicked on "VA benefits and health care"_) I'd view all health care since the main navigation doesn't tell me bills and payments. (_browse and scroll on the all health care page_) Ok, here's "Pay your VA copay bill". That was a few clicks to get here. It's buried down on the website, but I also see it'd be hard to have everything on the home page. 

**M: What do you expect to see?**

P: It would take me to a payment portal, and it'd tell me how much I own and tells me how I can take care of the bills. 

**M: Do you think this link will take you to that?**

P: Yeah, I'd think so. It's the only thing about payments I see so far. 

**M: What makes you say it's different?**

P: The Pay.gov logo and the logo is also on the top and bottom of the page. 

**M: How do you feel about that?**

P:  Mixed feeling, if I was working for a commercial, I would pay on their website. I know this is still a government website, so I still have confidence. This is something I used to deal with in the defense finance department in the military, and sometimes I had to call 3 places within the same department. 

# Task 3a: Medical Records - blood test results

(_click on the main navigation, and click on check lab and test results_) I used to work in health care, so this result kind of makes sense, but the abb. still doesn’t mean anything. I can see the results, but it doesn’t explain much of what it means. It’s not helpful without interpretations. 

# Task 3b: Medical Records to secure messaging

(_click on message on the secondary nav._) Ok, so I'd start a new message. This is intuitive. I'd make sure I send it to the right person, and here are the steps to tell me what to do. It’s pretty simple.

# Task 4: Appointments

(_click on message on the secondary nav._) Ok, so I'd start a new message. This is intuitive. I'd make sure I send it to the right person, and here are the steps to tell me what to do. It’s pretty simple.

# My VA vs. MHV



# Priority Groups

P hasn't heard of term. 

P: Priority Group? Uhh, I do not know, I honestly don't have a clue.
