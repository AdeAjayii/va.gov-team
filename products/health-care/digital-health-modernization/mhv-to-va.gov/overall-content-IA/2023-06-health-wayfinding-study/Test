## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

Let's start with a few questions...

- What kind of device are you using today? _(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)_
  -
- What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA?
  -

Screen sharing instructions

First, I'd like you to share your screen so I can see how you navigate the site. Do you know how to share your screen?

_Instructions for folks NOT using screen readers:_

- _[What issues do you see people running into?]_
  -

Thanks for your patience in figuring that out.

## **Wayfinding interview - 50 minutes**

Now I need to share with you a link to the prototype. How would you prefer the link? I could say it out loud for you to put into your browser, or I could put it in the Zoom chat.

Just as a reminder, this is a prototype, which means that it will behave differently than the actual website. Not all of the links will work. As well, please do not use the back button in your browser as it will take you out of the prototype. There is a back button in the prototype that you can use to go back in the prototype. I'll show you when you open the link.

_Send link to prototype:_ [_link_](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2023-06-health-wayfinding-study/link)_. Show participants where the prototype back button is._

### _ **Task 1** _ _- AVS task:__Participant should be starting from an unauthenticated home page._

### **Let's imagine that you recently had to visit a specialist to talk about a chronic condition. You want to review what was decided for the next steps in your care. Using this prototype, where do you go for this information? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking as you figure out how to do this on the website.**

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_

- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)?

[Where does the participant go first?]

[Does the participant recognize they need to login? What language do they use?]

[What is standing out to the participant?]

[What kind of health information is the participant mentioning?]

_Specific questions about AVS - must ask:_

_If participant is in the Appointments section:_

- This summary of your doctor's recommendations for the next steps in your care came out of an interaction you had while in an appointment with this doctor. Do you think you would want or expect to be able to get back to the details of that appointment from this page?

[Does the participant seem confident in this or do they express confusion?]

- How would you get back out to the larger appointments section?

[Does the participant seem confident in this or do they express confusion?]

- (_Or, if more appropriate wording, depending on their behavior_): How would you backtrack to where you came from?

  -

_If participant gets to AVS through Medical Records:_

- This summary of your doctor's recommendations for the next steps in your care came out of an interaction you had while in an appointment with this doctor. Do you think you would want or expect to be able to get back to the details of that appointment from this page?

_Participant should be deep into either Appointments or Medical Records at this point looking at AVS._

### _Task 2 - Copay & Claims task:_ You have two things that you need to do today - see if you owe payments to the VA for past health appointments and check on the status of a disability claim. Using this website, how would you go about doing these things? _(RQ_

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_
