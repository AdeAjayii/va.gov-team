## Intro - 5-10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Robyn/Jenny/Cara and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, I'll talk a little bit about what we'll be asking you today.  

We are part of a team working on the health sections of website VA.gov. We’d like to get your feedback on some changes we have made to how you can access your personal health information and benefits on VA.gov. Specifically, we'll be asking you to perform a set of activities that show how you would navigate the VA.gov website to access and manage health-related information and benenfits. Most of what we'll be asking you is about your reactions to what you see on the website and where you might expect things to be. We won't ask you for personal information about your own benefits - we'll focus on your thoughts on the changes we've made to the VA.gov website. 

It is worth noting that we will be using what we call a prototype. This is not an actual website, but rather a file that we use to explore what the website could look like and get feedback from users like yourself before we make any final changes to the website. This prototype will not work exactly like a website. For example, not all of the links will work and you cannot click the back button in your browser because it will take you away from the prototype. 

Thank you for confirming these things! Now, I have a few things about today I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you would like to stop the session, or do not want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know. 
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete, ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5-10 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)*

2. What benefits other than healthcare, if any, do you receive from the VA? 

## Brief card sort - 10 minutes
We are going to start with a sorting activity. 

This sorting activity is a tool that helps us to understand how Veterans would group certain items. If we can understand how items are grouped, we can then organize them in a way that makes it easier for Veterans to find what they need quickly. For example, if you were to organize a refrigerator, you might put certain food types together - like cheeses - to make it easier for you to find a cheese you like when you need it. 

**Example card sort**
*Preview link for demonstration purposes: https://dj540s05.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/vtqh45gr/sort* <-**update**

We will be using a website to do the sorting activity. I'll show you how it works. 

First, you'll see this screen on the left that has a list of different cards with information on them. On the right, you can drag items and group them together. Try to think of these groups as broader categories.

We ask folks to organize the cards into different groups that make sense to you. What are the things that different cards have in common? Or that make the groups different from each other? 

For me, looking at these cards on the left, I can organize the "Vanilla ice cream", "Cheddar cheese", and "Milk" cards together. I can rename the group by clicking on the "Click to rename" button at the top of the group - I'll rename this group "Dairy." I can organize "Lettuce" and "Broccoli" into a second group and label that "Vegetables." I have no idea what food group "cotton candy" might belong to, so I could put it in the "I don't know" group. 

If I decide that I don't like a group that I made, I can also click the x in the top righthand side of the box and the cards get returned to the left hand column. 

Do you have any questions at this point? 

**Share Optimal Workshop link with participant**

First, I'd like you to share your screen so I can see how you sort the carts. Do you know how to share your screen? 

_Instructions for folks NOT using screenreaders:_
- In the Zoom application on your computer/phone/tablet, there is a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a (green) button that says Share (phone), Share Screen (computer), or Broadcast screen (iPad). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)
  - Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the (green) button that says Share. Options should be provided for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

Thanks for your patience in figuring that out. 

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

Now I need to share with you a link to the sorting activity. How would you prefer the link to the sorting activity? I could say it out loud for you to put into your browser, or I could put it in the Zoom chat. 
- [Card sort link](link - do bit.ly) <-**update**


**Instructions to open the card sort:**
- Go to the chat in zoom. It is located at the bottom of this zoom window and looks like a speech bubble.
- Click on the link for the optimal workshop card sort.

_If participant needs extra instructions, or needs instructions to be repeated, use these:_ 
- On the left, we have cards with different labels. 
- On the right, you can drag these cards and group them together. Try to think of these groups as broader categories. 
- If you do not recognize what something is on one of the cards, or need me to explain it a bit more, let me know.

* Any questions at this point?

* Organize cards in a way that makes sense to you
	* We will start at the top left and work our way through the cards, while we are moving them, help me out by “thinking out loud” so that I can understand why you might want to group things together.

(_As participant puts cards into different groups_): Can you explain to me what you are thinking as you put *(card name)* and *(card name)* together? Why do those belong together? 

- _Continue to probe participant to explain their thinking as they group cards._

(_Review categories where you would like to understand what participants look for in a given category_): I see you created *(category)*. When you review information in *(category name)*, what data would be most important for you to know? 
	
   - _Example question_: When you review your appointments, what information would be most important for you to know? <-**update** 

_PROBE FOR UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENT CARDS AND TERMS, IF PARTICIPANT NOT EXPLAINING. Particularly interested in understanding how users differentiate between different types of resources. Examples probes could be:_ <-**update probes below**

	- What do you think "Pathology results" are? 
	- How are you understanding "Radiology results or images"? 
	- What do you think the difference is between "Encounter notes" and "Progress notes"?

- (_When complete_): Please go ahead and click the finish button so we can save these groupings. It’ll be anonymous. 


## Wayfinding interview - 40 minutes

**_Task 1 - AVS task:_ _Participant should be starting from unauthenticated home page._** Let's imagine that you recently had to visit a specialist to talk about a chronic condition. You want to review what was decided for the next steps in your care. Using this prototype, where do you go for this information? It would really help me if you could talk me through what you are thinking as you figure out how to do this on the website. 

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term? What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)? 

**Add in AVS questions when have them.**

_Participant should be deep into either Appointments or Medical Records at this point looking at AVS._

**_Task 2 - Copay & Claims task:_** You have two things that you need to do today - see if you owe payments to the VA for past health appointments and check on the status of a disability claim. Using this website, how would you go about doing these things? 

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term? What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)? 

_Specific questions - **must ask**:_ 

_When partipcant goes to My VA:_
- What is this page? 
- What is the purpose of this page? 
- how is this page different than the other page we were on with all the health resources? 

_Once participant clicks on Copay link and is directed to Pay.gov, ask them to click "Continue" at least once to get them further into the form._
- Where are you right now? 
- Are you on a different website than before? How do you feel about that? 
- Thank you, you don't need to go any further than this. How would you get back to the original website we were on? 

_Once participant has completed task:_
- If you could design this website, where would you put your disability resources and your health resources? 
- (_Ask participant to click between My VA and My HealtheVet pages_): If you were to describe these two pages to another Veteran, how would you explain them? 

**_Task 3a - Medical Records task:_** Imagine that you were recently put on blood thinner medication. Your doctor ordered blood tests two weeks after you started the medication to make sure that it is working. Where would you look for the results from those blood tests?

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- Why did you (_do that, go there, try that_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term? What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)? 

**Add in specific questions after MR designs more figured out, if any.**

**_Task 3b - Transition from Medical Records to Secure Messaging; participant should be deep into MR nav at this point:_** Say you're confused by your result and want to ask your doctor about it. Using the resources offered on this website, how would you send them a message? Again, if you could please tell me what you are thinking as you try to do this, it would be very helpful for me. 

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- Why did you (_do that, go there, try that_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term? What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)? 

**_Task 4 - Appointments task:_** Say you are going to see a specialist in a facility you've never visited before and you want to make sure that you know where you are going. How would you figure that out? 

_Optional probes - very flexible, adapt as appropriate depending on participant behavior:_ 
- What are you thinking as you (_go somewhere, do something_)? 
- Why did you (_do that, go there, try that_)? 
- (_If use search functionality_): Please tell me why you searched for that term? What information were you hoping it would bring up?
- What do you think should happen if you (_do something_)? 

_Specific questions - **must ask**:_ 

- (_If participant uses breadcrumbs_) Why did you click those links? 
- **Filter/ preferences questions - check in with Peter/Kristen to confirm.**
