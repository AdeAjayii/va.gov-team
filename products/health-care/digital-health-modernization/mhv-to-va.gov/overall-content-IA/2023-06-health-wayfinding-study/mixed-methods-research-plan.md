# Research Plan for Wayfinding study, July/August 2023

## Background

This study is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information.  This study aims to support this effort by investigating the different wayfinding strategies users use when completing key health management tasks on MHV on VA.gov.  It is part of a broader research effort to align Information Architecture for the MHV to VA.gov integration.  More on this can be found here: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/1d786b3abb178f9ae326c821596729b896a65090/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	
The purpose of this research is to assess users' reactions to and expectations of the new landing page for MHV on VA.gov, whether the current wayfinding tactics are effective at guiding users through the page, how users expect to be able to update health-related preferences, and how users expect timely statuses and notifications to be communicated to them. 

### Outcome

This research will inform updates to the MHV on VA.gov wayfinding efforts to support users across different experiences.

### Research questions

1. When users are at the "manage health" stage, where do they look for their health-related services and resources on VA.gov? What health-related information do they seek out?  
2. How do users navigate from an uanthenticated state to the the MHV portal?
3. How easily can users navigate to various tasks within the MHV portal?
4. Once deep within MHV portal tool nav hierarchy, how do users navigate back out to MHV portal or wider VA.gov? (e.g., out of health landing page, or specific tool on landing page) What do users do if they get lost?
5. How do users differentiate between My VA vs. MHV portal? What resources do they expect to be in each of those two locations?


## Method

### Interviews
We will conduct remote interviews with Zoom. These interviews will include questions documenting usersâ€™ process navigating to and within MHV on VA.gov, the mental models they use to find certain information, and their expectations related to health-specific tasks. The interviews will consist of a combination of tasks and direct questions. 


### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. 

Given the logistical complexities of this study, and given the fact misunderstandings on the part of participants could keep them from being logistically able to participate, we request the following: 
	(1) To have a kickoff meeting with Perigean to confirm that everyone is on the same page regarding the recruitment criteria;
	
	
**Availability for potential kickoff meeting times with Perigean, depending on their availability. Anticipate KO meeting lasting 30 minutes**


We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information (whether the Veteran has used MyHealtheVet before; whether the Veteran uses VA healthcare) in an encrypted Google Sheet that will be stored on the Ad Hoc Google Drive. 

## Recruitment criteria

Primary criteria (must-haves)
- Must currently receive VA healthcare benefits 
- Must have an active MHV account that they have accessed at least once in the past 12 months
- Must have self-reported infrequent usage of VA.gov


**Desired sample**
15 frequent users of MHV
15 infrequent users of MHV
Age and education level range throughout, but ideally include at least 15 participants older than 55 and 12 participants with a some college or less as their terminal degree
