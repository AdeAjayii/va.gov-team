# What we did
## What are the tasks participants need to complete about AVS and Appointments? 
**AVS task:** We asked participants to walk us through how they would go about finding the next steps in their care from a recent visit with a specialist about a chronic condition. 

**Appt task:** We asked participants to walk us through how they would figure out where they need to go for an upcoming appointment with a specialist in a VA medical center they’ve never visited before. 

## What are the questions we asked throughout each task?
As participants navigate through each task, we ask them: 
-	What they are thinking 
-	What terms they would search (if they want to search)
-	What information do they expect to see
-	Why do they click on those links
This is to understand their mental model and to see if there are patterns to what they think and feel when completing health-related activities.

## How did we observe?
To ensure we capture what they do/say/feel accurately, besides taking transcribe notes, we also captured them on the [Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1688057183385/892e08ae73c1a90432e0f8bb6cd8a620ee8bf2dc?sender=ueeece9e244394145c84e5173) and labeled them by behaviors, feelings, and flows to show how they navigated while talking out aloud. This strategy allows us to easily review each participant, and find patterns.

## Analysis strategies
We had two sets of data to analyze: observation notes on a Mural board and interview transcripts. Through comparing and bucketing and analyzing, we arrived at findings. With quantitative analysis, we were able to find the repeated patterns and answer the AVS and Appointments questions. 

# What we learned
Here is a list of questions we addressed for Appointments and AVS in this study:

_Note: We conducted 18 interviews in total. There is one failed interview because the participant had challenges processing questions and tasks and the facilitator didn't proceed with simpler questions. So, there are 17 interviews we pulled data from._

### - Where did people look for their AVS -> Med Records or Appointments?

There are multiple paths participants took, which you could read more into the overall "figure-it-outness" finding. For example, one participant found MR's top task link on the My VA landing page, and one participant found MR after clicking on the MHV portal tab. With that being said, 15 out of 17 participants took the path that led them to MR to look for AVS. Out of the 15 participants, 2 went into secure messaging and expected to find AVS in messages from their doctors. 

**Quotes:**
_"I'm looking for something that says after-visit summary or doctor's notes."_
_"Well, I would go to medical records."_ (while on VA.gov home)

### - How often is BB brought in relation to AVS?
Blue Button (this term) was only brought up once (_1 out of 17_), so it's not referred to generally. 

**Quote:**
_"I would go to BB and look at health records”_ when asked to review the next steps in care from the previous visit.

### - Do participants open details and think the details are AVS or scroll down to the treatment plan?
All the participants clicked into the details of AVS. 13 out of 17 scrolled on the details page and clicked to expand the treatment plan tab. Out of the 13 participants who read the treatment plan, 3 participants are still confused after reading it and were not sure if they were looking at the doctor's notes. 

**Quote:**
_"The next steps in my care should be my treatment plan."_
_“I would take a look at the treatment plan and find out what they’re gonna be doing."_
_"Now I feel stuck. I don't see doctor's notes."_ (while on the AVS details page)

### - How do people navigate in/out of the Appointments section (back button, breadcrumbs, secondary nav, etc.)?
_Note: For this task, we have 3 failed data. Two participants got stuck and didn't know how to get into Appointments, and one participant had to stop the interview._
#### IN 

For the first reaction, 6 out of 14 participants wanted to click "Find VA location", but the link doesn't work. 10 out of 14 participants used secondary navigation to go to the Appointments section. 3 went to the MHV landing page, and 1 used the back button to backtrace. So, the majority of the participants replied on the secondary navigation.  

#### OUT
8 out of 14 participants clicked the "back to Appointments" breadcrumb to get back out to the Appointments list page, and 6 used the browser back button. 

### - How are participants understanding the term "Requests"?
Out of 17 participants, only 2 guessed the correct meaning of "Requests". The majority of the participants thought they could request or change or take some sort of action if they click "Requests". So, "Requests" should not replace "Pending". 

**Quotes:**
_"I expect to change or request an appointment."_
_"Maybe ask the VA to see a particular specialist."_
_"It should give me an option or calendar to schedule appointments. It would have to be with a specific doctor or department as options."_

### - Did participants use the filter in past appointments?
Not enough participants accessed AVS through Appts, so we really weren't able to explore this. No conclusions.
