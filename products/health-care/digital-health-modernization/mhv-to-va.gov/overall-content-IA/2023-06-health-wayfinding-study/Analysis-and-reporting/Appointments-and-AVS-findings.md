# What we did
## What are the tasks participants need to complete about AVS and Appointments? 
**AVS task:** We asked participants to walk us through how they would go about finding the next steps in their care from a recent visit with a specialist about a chronic condition. 

**Appt task:** We asked participants to walk us through how they would figure out where they need to go for an upcoming appointment with a specialist in a VA medical center theyâ€™ve never visited before. 

## What are the questions we asked throughout each task?
As participants navigate through each task, we ask them: 
-	What they are thinking 
-	What terms they would search (if they want to search)
-	What information do they expect to see
-	Why do they click on those links
This is to understand their mental model and to see if there are patterns to what they think and feel when completing health-related activities.

## How did we observe?
To ensure we capture what they do/say/feel accurately, besides taking transcribe notes, we also captured them on the [Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1688057183385/892e08ae73c1a90432e0f8bb6cd8a620ee8bf2dc?sender=ueeece9e244394145c84e5173) and labeled them by behaviors, feelings, and flows to show how they navigated while talking out aloud. This strategy allows us to easily review each participant, and find patterns.

## Analysis strategies
We had two sets of data to analyze: observation notes on a Mural board and interview transcripts. Through comparing and bucketing and analyzing, we arrived at findings. With quantitative analysis, we were able to find the repeated patterns and answer the AVS and Appointments questions. 

# What we learned
- Where did people look for their AVS -> Med Records or Appointments?
- How often is BB brought in relation to AVS?
- Do participants open details and think the details are AVS or scroll down to the treatment plan:
- How do people navigate in/out of the Appointments section (back button, breadcrumbs, secondary nav, etc.)
- How are participants understanding the term "Requests"?
- Did participants use the filter in past appts?
