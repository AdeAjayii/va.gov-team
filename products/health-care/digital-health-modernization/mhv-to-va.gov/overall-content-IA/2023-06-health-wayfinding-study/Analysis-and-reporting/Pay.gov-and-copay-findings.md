# What we did
## What are the tasks participants need to complete about AVS and Appointments? 
**Copay task:**  You want to see if you owe payments to the VA for past health appointments, and how would you go about paying it?

## What are the questions we asked throughout the task?
As participants navigate through the task, we ask them: 
-	What they are thinking 
-	What terms they would search (if they want to search)
-	What information do they expect to see
-	Why do they click on those links
This is to understand their mental model and to see if there are patterns to what they think and feel when completing health-related activities.

Once participant clicks on the Copay link and is directed to Pay.gov, we ask them to click "Continue" at least once to get them further into the form:
- Where are you right now?
- Are you on a different website than before?
- How do you feel about being on a different website?
- How would you get back to the original website we were on?

## How did we observe?
To ensure we capture what they do/say/feel accurately, besides taking transcribe notes, we also captured them on the [Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1688057183385/892e08ae73c1a90432e0f8bb6cd8a620ee8bf2dc?sender=ueeece9e244394145c84e5173) and labeled them by behaviors, feelings, and flows to show how they navigated while talking out aloud. This strategy allows us to easily review each participant, and find patterns.

## Analysis strategies
We had two sets of data to analyze: observation notes on a Mural board and interview transcripts. Through comparing and bucketing and analyzing, we arrived at findings. Also, with quantitative analysis, we were able to find the repeated patterns and answer the Pay.gov and copay questions. 

# What we learned

- **When they leave VA.gov and go to Pay.gov: Where do they think they are? How do they feel when they realize they are no longer on VA.gov?**
- **How do they think about/ understand debt vs. copay?**
- **How do users know how much to pay?**
- **How is the payment linked to the bill?**
Copay = I think just the nugget about including a link to your bills on the MHV landing page, rather than just a link to where you pay the bill. Came from a comment from only one participant, but seems valuable.
