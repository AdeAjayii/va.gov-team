Pay.gov = when they leave VA.gov and go to Pay.gov; where do they think they are? How do they feel when they realize they are no longer on VA.gov? 

Copay = I think just the nugget about including a link to your bills on MHV landing page, rather than just link to where you pay bill. Came from comment from only one participant, but seems valuable. How do users know how much to pay? And how is the payment linked to the bill? (This might require just asking around - is this confusion due to the prototype? IRL, is this the same experience or does something else happen when on prod?)
