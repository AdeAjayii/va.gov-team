# What we did
## What are the tasks participants need to complete about AVS and Appointments? 
**Copay task:**  You want to see if you owe payments to the VA for past health appointments, and how would you go about paying it?

## What are the questions we asked throughout the task?
As participants navigate through the task, we ask them: 
-	What they are thinking 
-	What terms they would search (if they want to search)
-	What information do they expect to see
-	Why do they click on those links
This is to understand their mental model and to see if there are patterns to what they think and feel when completing health-related activities.

Once participant clicks on the Copay link and is directed to Pay.gov, we ask them to click "Continue" at least once to get them further into the form:
- Where are you right now?
- Are you on a different website than before?
- How do you feel about being on a different website?
- How would you get back to the original website we were on?

## How did we observe?
To ensure we capture what they do/say/feel accurately, besides taking transcribe notes, we also captured them on the [Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1688057183385/892e08ae73c1a90432e0f8bb6cd8a620ee8bf2dc?sender=ueeece9e244394145c84e5173) and labeled them by behaviors, feelings, and flows to show how they navigated while talking out aloud. This strategy allows us to easily review each participant, and find patterns.

## Analysis strategies
We had two sets of data to analyze: observation notes on a Mural board and interview transcripts. Through comparing and bucketing and analyzing, we arrived at findings. Also, with quantitative analysis, we were able to find the repeated patterns and answer the Pay.gov and copay questions. 

# What we learned

- **When they leave VA.gov and go to Pay.gov: Where do they think they are? How do they feel when they realize they are no longer on VA.gov?**
  _Note: 3 failed data collections (due to technical difficulties and time limitations)_

  10 out of 15 participants thought they were on a different website (not VA.gov). When asked where they were, they were all able to identify the Pay.gov website as their location by pointing out the Pay.gov logo, header, and footer area. The rest of the participants (4 out of 15) all assumed they were still on either VA.gov or My HealtheVet because they were not notified that they were being directed to another website. In other words, they all expect to be notified if they are leaving VA.gov. 

  **Quote**
  - _"I would think I'm still on VA.gov. It didn't tell me I was moved (to another website)."_

  Out of the 10 participants who realized they were on a different website, 6 participants told us how they felt about it. They all expressed some levels of discomfort and lack of confidence in the two websites' transition.

   **Quotes**
  - _"It's not the best (feeling), and not the worst. It's weird that I had to come to a different site."_
  - _"This bugs me. It should tell me when I leave VA."_
  - _"I'm always unsure at first, and wondering if it's the right site."_ 
  
- **How do they think about/ understand debt vs. copay?**
- **How do users know how much to pay?**
- **How is the payment linked to the bill?**
Copay = I think just the nugget about including a link to your bills on the MHV landing page, rather than just a link to where you pay the bill. Came from a comment from only one participant, but seems valuable.
