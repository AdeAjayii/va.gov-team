## Research Goals
Based on the previous tree test findings, the team iterated on the information architecture for the health hub and health apartment. As the team considers how to properly include the Health Apartment on VA.gov to ensure Veterans and Caregivers to get and manage their health care benefits, this research will help inform decisions on the information architecture of the health apartment and how it links to the broader VA.gov structure.

Veteran tasks fit in the following key points in the Veteran journey:
- Primary – Starting up and Taking care of myself
- Secondary – Putting down roots, Retiring, Aging

The goal of this research is to gather quantitative insights on the findability of more detailed and deeper tasks within the proposed IA of the My health patient portal experience.

In these tree tests, we will aim to:
- Evaluate the findability of various information within the "My Health" structure
- Evaluate where participants look for information related to their health records between "Appointments", "Health history", and "Medical records"


## Research Questions

Can Veterans navigate the proposed information architecture of the My health patient portal in order to find information and complete tasks related to managing their health?


## Methodology 

- We utilized Optimal Workshop's Treeejack tool to conduct unmoderated sessions with Veterans
- This tool allows us to collect data on how participants navigate a menu structure to find the answers to questions/tasks
- Participants were asked to complete 10 tasks by navigating a menu structure and indicating where they would be able to find the answer
- Participants were started at the top of the menu for each task with the menu fully collapsed
- Tasks were randomized to avoid bias from learning the tree as the test progressed

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypotheses or tasks for this research along with the conclusions you found If you conducted a usability test, list the success or task completion rate._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)_

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_

Veterans will understand what types of information can be found in the “Test results”, "Health history" and "Medical records" sections.
- Veterans will easily find the vaccine history under the "Health history" section.
- Veterans will easily find basic health data within "Health history".
- Veterans will easily find the option to download their health records under "Medical records".
- Veterans will easily find information on labs and tests.
Veterans will understand that the "Medications" section includes all of their prescription information - current and past.
- Veterans will easily find where to refill their prescriptions in a section labeled "Medications".
- Veterans will easily find historical prescription information under "Medications".
Veterans will look for appointment follow-up tasks and information within the "Appointments" section.
- Veterans will easily find travel pay if it is placed with their past appointment in the "Appointments" section.
- Veterans will more easily find their after-visit summaries with their past appointments in the "Appointments" section than in the "Health history" section with other types of clinical notes.
Veterans will easily find general information and tasks related to their VA health benefits within the "My health benefits" grouping.


## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)_

1. The different sections containing health and medical records information had some overlap in meaning, but were still successful tasks
2. The “Appointments” section was not the primary place Veterans looked for post-appointment tasks such as travel pay or after-visit summaries 
3. Veterans looked for both current and past prescription information within the “Medications” section
4. It is unknown if Veterans understand what to expect within the “My health benefits” section
5. The placement and labeling of “vitals” is not entirely clear to Veterans


## Details of Findings 

_For each finding, list details with supporting quotes and images when possible. Please **add relevant keywords/labels to your findings** selected from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc). Adding keywords/labels to your findings will help others find research relevant to their work._

**Finding 1: The different sections containing health and medical information have some overlap in meaning, but were still successful tasks**

Labels: label 1, label 2 

_List all labels that apply to this finding from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

- We tested 5 items related to health and medical information that were placed within the 3 separate areas – Test results, Health history, and Medical records
- While most Veterans navigated to and selected answers in the correct section, there was consistently a small number of participants that navigated to the “Medical records” section for these tasks

_Highlighted and bold indicates the preferred path; Blank indicates <2%_

**Hypothesis**: Veterans will understand what types of information can be found in the “Test results”, "Health history“, and "Medical records" sections

**Related tasks**:
2) You saw your primary care provider last month and want to review what was decided for next steps in your care.
5) You want to find the results of a recent MRI you had done.
6) You need to know when you had your last tetanus shot.
7) You want to know what your blood pressure was the last time you had it taken at a VA medical facility.
8) You want to get a copy of your VA health records for your personal files.




**Finding 2: The “Appointments” section was not the primary place Veterans looked for post-appointment tasks such as travel pay or after-visit summaries**

Labels: label 1, label 2 

_List all labels that apply to this finding from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

- Veterans primarily navigated to and selected answers in areas other than “Appointments”,  however there was still a significant number of Veterans that navigated to “Appointments” for these tasks 
- Veterans not enrolled in VA health care were twice as likely to look in “Appointments” than Veterans currently enrolled in VA health care
- For the after-visit summary task, over 50% of Veterans correctly selected the “After-visit summary” option in either “Health history” or “appointments”, indicating there is likely some understanding or familiarity with that label
- Notes: Travel pay is not available within appointments in today's VA.gov or MHV experience

_Bold indicates the majority path_

**Hypothesis**: Veterans will look for appointment follow-up tasks and information within the "Appointments" section – including travel pay and after-visit summaries

**Related tasks**: 
1. You drove to see your VA primary care physician and want to get paid back for the cost of gas.
2. You saw your primary care provider last month and want to review what was decided for next steps in your care.




**Finding 3: Veterans looked for both current and past prescription information within the “Medications” section**

Labels: label 1, label 2 

_List all labels that apply to this finding from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc)._

- For this round of testing, the label of the previous “Prescriptions” section was changed to “Medications” to better encompass all of the prescribed and over the counter medications that patients may be taking
- Over 74% of all Veterans looked to the “Medications” section to find information on both current and past prescriptions
- There was a small percentage of Veterans that looked in “Health history” for information on an old prescription
