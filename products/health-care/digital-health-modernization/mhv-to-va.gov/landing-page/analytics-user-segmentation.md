# Feasibility study of analytics segmentation by user data type

This document shares analytics segmentation ideas for data collection on the MHV on VA.gov landing page. This list of ideas should also inform data collection and reporting for a portal-level data dashboard. The document is broken down into three segments that will be updated over time: 
1. Data already being collected
2. Data that is feasible, but not yet being collected
3. Data that we may want to collect in the future, but is not feasible
