# Feedback

_The path to request new hearing aid batteries. As the programmer I had to get help on where to find this._


**Can you show us the path you are referring to? Why do you think it is so confusing?**

**Where else would you place hearing aid batteries?**


# Find VA Events and News articles


**What did you mean by this piece of feedback?**

_PACT and Mission Act are very hard to locate. Need a News banner_


**Where would you like to see the news banner?**


# MHV


_Images are impossible to pull up. I have MRI images from 2 years ago that I still cannot view_


**What makes images impossible to pull up for you? Why can you still not view them from 2 years ago?**


_Getting back to VA.gov (no direct link)._


**Can you tell us more about this? In what common situations would you want to go from MHV back to VA.gov?**


_For Med records. Not sure the 10 year rule came from but as a Veteran I should be able to pull any of my med records_


**When you refer to med records, which part of MHV are you referring to?**


# Other

_In response to Lauren saying, "I think some of the planned improvements to the new portal will address some of these questions. I.e. we’ll have a section in the portal to reorder medical supplies, s/a batteries, CPAP supplies, etc. We’re also doing a pretty big overhaul over the records section, which we’re hoping will yield a better user experience. And in the meanwhile, we’re working on designing better pathways between the two sites while myhealth.va.gov is up."_

_You said,_

_This will continue to be a problem and it is still not that clean yet since the Veteran is still seeing all the page changes rather than one page stating “Wait while we process your request” and al the page flicking is in the background._


**What did you mean by this? Can you show us?**
