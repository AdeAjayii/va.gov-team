# Research Plan for Core MHV on VA.gov team, Landing Page, March/April 2023

## Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. A landing page was designed, developed, and launched on March 16, 2023. 


Discovery research was carried out in September, 2022 (see [this folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/medical-records/research/2022-09-informational-interviews) for more information). This research has helped us to identify and prioritize gaps that we must address via primary research with Veterans to ensure that the Medical Records experience on the redesigned MHV will enable Veterans to complete their top tasks with minimal pain points.
