This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

_Add ~5-10 top of mind findings. Include quotes if they are available or particularly noteworthy. [Example top line summary.](https://portigal.com/reading-ahead-topline-summary/)_

**Research Question #1:** What are users' reactions to and expectations from the new landing page? What do they understand this new landing page to be and how do they understand it in relation to VA.gov and the current version of MyHealtheVet?

**Finding #1**Participants understood the landing page to be **a place to manage their health** and at first glance recognized how the landing page could be used to **accomplish broad health tasks.** 


> “... when I come onto this website…I’m looking at how to refill prescriptions, or see when appointments are…**I like the fact that stuff is right on top**. ” - P6

>“It’s an informational page that lets people know where they could go to manage their care and it also shows exactly what you can manage…” - P3 

>“...the type is bigger, that is good for a person my age....There’s a lot of worthwhile information on this page, and **it’s much larger, it’s much easier to read**.” - P9

**Finding #2** Overall, participants - the majority of them current users of My HealtheVet Classic - see the new landing page as an updated My HealtheVet Classic, which they conflate with VA.gov.  Therefore, they interpret the new landing page as an update of their known experience [My HealtheVet Classic] rather than a new, separate experience.

- Note for future: this is why it is so important to have more non-MHV  in future studies to incorporate users who do NOT have that brand recognition
- Notes/question for DHM team: Jonathan and Cara are still fleshing this insight out further.

**Additional question:** How do participants understand "Download medical records (Blue Button)"  vs. "Health History"? 

**Finding #3**Participants did not clearly distinguish between Download medical records (Blue Button) and Health history as mutually exclusive of each other. 
- Participants often perceived Health History as a “snapshot” of their health
- Download medical records (Blue Button) as having their complete medical records [test results, x-rays, notes from doctors, etc]

>“Expect [Medical records] to have the entire medical record downloaded. That's how it reads to me. That would be a whole heck of a lot of medical records.” - P12

>“I thought that would've been the same thing. Or, maybe bullet points, with Blue Button being all the data.” - P4

>“[Health] History would be a chronological overview of health issues and diagnoses.” - P28
