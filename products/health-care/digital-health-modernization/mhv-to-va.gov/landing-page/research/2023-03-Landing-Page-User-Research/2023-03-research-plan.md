# Research Plan for Core MHV on VA.gov team, Landing Page, March/April 2023

## Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. A landing page was designed, developed, and will be launched on March 16, 2023. 

Previous research on [earlier prototypes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/initial-mhv-prototype) and [information architecture](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA) informed the design of the landing page. However, there is a need to understand how users are experiencing the new landing page, whether and how they can find the landing page from the VA.gov home page, and what additional UX opportunities can be capitalized upon to improve their experience.

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following OCTO objectives: 

1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals 	
The purpose of this research is to assess users' reactions to and expectations of the new landing page for MHV on VA.gov, whether the current wayfinding tactics are effective at guiding users through the page, how users expect to be able to update health-related preferences, and how users expect timely statuses and notifications to be communicated to them. 

### Outcome
This research will inform updates to the MHV on VA.gov landing page, currently in [staging](https://staging.va.gov/my-health/) to be launched on March 16, 2023. 

### Research questions

1. What are users reactions to and expectations from the new landing page? What do they understand this new landing page to be and how do they understand it in relation to VA.gov and the legacy MyHealtheVet? 

2. Are users able to navigate to the new landing page from an unauthenticated state, navigate and use the tools available there, and ultimately achieve their goals using the current wayfinding tactics? 

3. How do users expect to update their health-specific preferences in the new experience? 

4. How do users expect to receive timely statuses or notifications in the new experience? 

### Hypotheses
_Hypothesis 1:_ Participants will sign in and then go to the "My Health" tab next to "My VA" in order to get to the new MHV on VA.gov landing page. 

_Hypthesis 2:_ 

_Hypothesis 3:_  

_Hypothesis 4:_ 

## Method

### Method type (e.g., interviews). 


### Location
Data collection will be remote and conducted using Zoom. 

### Research materials


## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach
We will partner with Perigean to recruit Veterans. All efforts will be made to recruit a diverse sample, with participants backgrounds ranging across age, abilities, and ethnicities. We will keep track of participant demographic information (identified gender, age, ethnicity, cognitive abilities) and other relevant information (whether the Veteran has used MyHealtheVet before; whether the Veteran uses VA healthcare) in an encrypted Google Sheet that will be stored on the Ad Hoc Google Drive.
