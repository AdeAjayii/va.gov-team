# Medication Notifications
* Currently in MYV Classic, the only medication-related notification that is active is: Your prescription has been shipped. See Slack thread [here](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C059GGJEFQU/p1692885524618009) (private channel) or screenshot below. <img width="552" alt="Screenshot 2023-08-24 at 12 45 10 PM" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/115033532/2545053f-68bb-4874-9a02-ed305e6aeb2c">
* Besides the shipped notification, the team plans to not include any other notifications through PI12 (which runs through early November) 

## State of Medications home page
* [Conversation with Lexi Wunder, designer for Medications product, on Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04PRFEJQTY/p1693227259719749)
* To summarize, at this point, if users were to follow a dot notification to the Medications app, they would not necessarily know what the dot was referring to (what is new here?)
* Given this information, there are two options I can think of:
  * Work with Medications app team to make it clear what is new on the Medication app home (my preference)
  * Or, use a different notification type to incorporate text and a direct link to the Medication that is shipped
