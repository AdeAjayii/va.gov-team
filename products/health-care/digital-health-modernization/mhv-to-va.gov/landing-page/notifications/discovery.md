# Notifications Discovery Work
June 14, 2023

## Onsite vs. On-screen notifications
On-screen = push notification
Onsite = notifications right in the UI of the site

## My VA team's progress so far
- Currently, My VA has one notification type that is live and active in production: new debt notification
- Have made the decision to have all notifications go through My VA instead of directly from the backend because that will keep emails, texts and onsite notifications coordinated in one place
