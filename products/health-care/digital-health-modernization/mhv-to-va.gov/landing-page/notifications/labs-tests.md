## Medical Images
* Before moving over to VA.gov, MHV offered a user-maintained setting with radio buttons to either be notified of new medical images or not (but what this notification is and what exactly it looks like is harder to find)

* [From Liz Lantz](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04DRS3L9NV/p1687786761816379?thread_ts=1686334008.074209&cid=C04DRS3L9NV): "The 'VA medical images and reports available notification' is a message triggered only after a user has requested a specific set of images in the MHV 'Download my data' > 'Medical images and reports' section."
* [Also from Liz](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04DRS3L9NV/p1687786761816379?thread_ts=1686334008.074209&cid=C04DRS3L9NV): "There’s a table that lists all the available image and radiology reports, and each one has up to three options: View Report, View Images, and Request. If they click request, it triggers the process to get the images in a downloadable format (unsure of exactly what systems/APIs are called) and modal saying “Your request is currently processing. It may take some time to retrieve your VA Medical Images and Reports. In the meantime, you can choose to [update your profile](link to profile) to get an email notifying you when they are ready to view.'”
* [From Lexi Wunder](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04DRS3L9NV/p1686592560953199?thread_ts=1686334008.074209&cid=C04DRS3L9NV): "This screenshot is the modal that appears after you click "Request Images" when looking at the table of all your images and reports. Note: Reports are immediately available when entered, but the user always has to "request" the images. I think "request" in this sense is more of a load/generate action than actually submitting a request for approval. Carnetta and Patty Henry would likely be the ones to ask. Let me know if you'd like me to be part of those conversations."
