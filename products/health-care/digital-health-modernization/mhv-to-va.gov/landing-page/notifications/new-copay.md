# Copay Notifications
* At this point, the only notification that exists is a "new copay" notification that is sent to Veterans; now, when Veterans have a new copay statement, they receive both an email and a statement in the mail
* Denise Coveyduc told me, "We have a few future submission notifications planned to confirm receipt of certain Veteran submissions but that is a ways out. So short answer, we are not currently planning any new notifications in the short term."
* The notification Denise mentioned would likely not fit into the type of notifications we would want to show on the landing page (it's a confirmation, so it does not fit the principle included in [Notification Definitions and UX Principles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/landing-page/notifications/notification_definitions_and_ux_principles.md), which states, "Notifications tell the user about events that happen to the user (as opposed to events that the user completes), for example: a notification is generated when a user has a new secure message, but not when a user successfully sends a secure message."
