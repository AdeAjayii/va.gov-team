# Appointment notifications

The current landscape of appointment-related notifications is complex, and the appointments team has put together extensive documentation and research to describe when and how Veteran patients get notified about various appointment reminders, schedule changes, cancellations, and when appointment requests become scheduled.

## Discovery research

Per our working document on [notification definitions and working principles ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/landing-page/notifications/notification_definitions_and_ux_principles.md), the lightweight dot or badge notification design is a simple indicator that that intends to signal new or unread content in a relevant area on either MyVA or the MHV on VA.gov landing page. This design is being implemented for secure messages, but may not scale to all types of notifications, particularly those with a possible negative consequence to the Veteran user.
