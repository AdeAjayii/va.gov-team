# Ways to build upon what has been learned in the past: Challenges and some ways around them

- We need to know what's come before us and what has been learned
- Currently we have the [research repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/projects/1) to do this from an OCTO perspective; it is not comprehensive and for the most part, doesn't include learning from VES or VEO. Efforts are in route to resolve this by piloting the use of Enjoy HQ, however it is not available to us yet

## In the meantime, here are some suggestions for ways to look for insights that are most relevant for your work: 

### Using the research repo
Searching through the research repo can be a little challenging (though it has been a big leap forward from life before the repo). There are a couple ways to search the repo, all of which _may_ produce different results: 

1. Use the card labels _(Easiest but least comprehensive)_
-  All studies should be tagged with different cards. You can use the "filter" functionality at the top of the page. [Instructions can be found here.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/145)

-  Generic card labels that intersect with MHV on VA.gov work include (but are not limited to): 
      -  BNFT: Healthcare
      - Any MHV label
      - PRDT: health-care-apartment
      - PRDT: health-care-patient-portal
      - PRDT: Medical-records
      - PRDT: MHV integration to VA.gov

2. Search using GitHub Desktop and VS Code _(More difficult but most comprehensive)_

### Other strategies

1. Make sure you're "in the know" about what other teams are doing
- Attend the Veteran Digital User Experience Weekly Design Sync every Monday
- Participate in syncs with other teams as needed (e.g., cross-team syncs with others working on related projects)
- Review the GitHub folders of teams that you know overlap with your product (such as Mobile)

2. Google

This approach usually produces more foundational knowledge that isn't immediately relevant but still worth knowing. For example, googling can produce insights around [Veteran population demographics](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/04/05/the-changing-face-of-americas-veteran-population/) or VA-specific sites related to the [burden of vision disabilities](https://www.prosthetics.va.gov/blindrehab/About_Blind_Rehabilitation_Service.asp) amongst current and future users of VA.gov.
