## Notes
- Weds meeting: What's helpful for us? 
  - Lexi: Helpful for getting feedback, face time with VA.gov stakeholders. Helpful for relatioships with devs, helping them to see designs. Helpful to show stakeholders (devs, VA.gov POs) to provide feedback before things go in front of users. 
  - Jonathan: So much historical knowledge in Patty/Carnetta's mind libraries. "These stakeholders" - OCTO POs (Patty, Carnetta), and our PO (Tracy in the past). Helpful to have backing of Tracy/Lauren - making aware of our perspective and what going to fight for. Better understand resistence. 
  - Lexi: Help keep everything agile. Tracy helped navigate issues brought up by Patti. May take multiple meetings to understand root of problem. Can also help shift responsibility for prior research that is out of scope (e.g., patient safety group). Have it documented - they are responsible for X action item. 
  - Robyn: What about devs? What's been useful in past? 
  - Lexi: In past, basic IA. Devs able to take that, make scaffolding, get started on developing before designs finalized. Helped to flag what's possible/ impossible. Do technical research. 

Robyn: Two groups of stakeholders - different needs. OCTO POs - need to be updated about progress to provide historical insight/feebdack, to get feedback on designs, and to get buy-in. Devs - to get insight into and provide feedback on designs to ensure progress, avoid problems. 
  - Lexi: Maybe add to agenda - have a meeting for the meeting. What's the purpose of the meeting? As devs able to demo what done to stakeholders. When no designs to show, devs show what done prior to company-wide demos. 

Action items: 
  - Identify who "owns" the agenda - Bryan or Lexi? 
  - Potentially use today's meeting to talk about the meeting
