## My Health IA Tree Test Presentation (Mikki)
- 2nd test focused on My Health
- Feedback from Lauren: Mikki - when you give this to broader group beyond us, we may need to explain that sometimes we need to put something in the IA of a tree jack test that may not be in the IA. I can see some folks getting hung up on why we put something in the IA.
- Anything above 70% is considered a pass
- Findings details are in Mikki's slide deck
- Lauren - next piece of this is throwing in a more qualitative way
- Lauren related comments: 
  - Met with Office of Community Care, and there are a lot of medical things that a user may need to download.  Medical Records is a big umbrella.  Do we have Download medical records/download CCB with other things to download.
  - How to disseminate this to the ByLight team - share at a Wed design review meeting so that the stakeholders and ByLight are all there.
  - Question is how to best present it to the stakeholder group who may not be familiar with tree tests
  - We're taking a very different tack with records

## Parking Lot
- How and when do we want to get things rolling for landing page engineering implementation?
  - Patrick can get with Daniel / Mark / Stephen and anyone else interested async
- For Lauren to answer: soft retirement of MHV appointment list via landing page launch, or not?
  - Do the appointment links link to VAOS or to MHV? 
    - Decision - Lauren - this will herald the soft retirement of VAOS
