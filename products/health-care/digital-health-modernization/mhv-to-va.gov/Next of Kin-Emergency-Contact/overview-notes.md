# Overview for moving Emergency contact and Next of kin fileds 

## Purpose

We have been tasked with migrating **Next of Kin** (NOK) and **Emergency Contact** (EC) to VA.gov. This is a central place for notes, documents, and other information gathered (prior to discovery)

## Background 

Liz Lantz (liz.lantz@adhocteam.us) and the Authenticated Experience team conducted research (April 2022) and provided recommendations on migrating the My HealtheVet (MHV) profile into the VA.gov profile. [See the full recommendations here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2022-05-MHV-profile-research/recommendations.md#in-case-of-emergency-section) 

# Relevant recommendations 

**In case of emergency section**

We heard from stakeholders that the data in this field is strictly used to inform the printable health information wallet card, and isn’t accessible by VA staff in an emergency situation.

>We heard from users that it’s helpful to be able to manage this information because they expect it’s part of their health record and accessible by VA staff. This would be a helpful feature if it tied back to a VA database and updated emergency contact information within the health care system/ Since it doesn’t, it misleads and confuses users.

**Recommendation:** We shouldn’t bring this over to the VA.gov profile in its current state. It’s worth adding this item to the list of health-related profile items to discuss with the health modernization team.
