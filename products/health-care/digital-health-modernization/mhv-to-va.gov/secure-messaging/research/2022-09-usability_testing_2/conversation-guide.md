## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Robyn. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes. 

There are a few of my teammates who would like to observe this session and take notes. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**
- *(If yes, let them in. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*

- *(NOTETAKER & OBSERVERS JOIN w/cameras ON )* We have a few people from the team listening in today: there's [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, [NAME] *(wave or say "hi")*, etc. *(If I don't know the name of one of the observers, ask them to please turn on their camera and say their name aloud)*

Could the notetaker and observers please turn their cameras off now to save bandwidth? *(and leave their real names instead of "Observer")*

*(For sessions with a participant using a screen reader:)* Angela is also in this meeting to help with any technical issues that may arise with your use of a screen reader during this session.

Today I'm going to be asking you some questions about your experiences with the VA, and then I'll ask you to do a sorting exercise.

BeBefore we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- I am going to be asking you today about your experiences with seeing, using, or sharing health information. **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, or don't want to answer a question, that's no problem. Please let me know.** 

- I'd like to record my screen and audio as we talk today to make sure I don't forget anything you tell me. I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. We won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to your name or any information that could identify you. **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

*Click Live Transcript and* **Enable**. 

*Click Live Transcript > View Full Transcript*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" (phone) or your web browser.
- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
 
## Warm-up Questions - 5-10 minutes
Let’s start with a few questions... 

1. What kind of device are you using today? *(Computer / Tablet / Smartphone)*

2. *(If using assistive technology:)* How would you rate your level of experience with using [specific assistive technology, such as a screen reader]--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?

	- *(If using assistive technology:)* How long have you been using [specific assistive technology]?

3. As we age, we continue to have health-related experiences that need to be documented so that we can better understand our health and so that our doctors, nurses, and other providers can better take care of us. If all your health issues, treatments, and other histories were combined into one list, what would you call that list?  

	- *OPTIONAL PROBES:* Would different types of information be in different lists? What types of lists would be in one list versus a different list? *(Interviewer can continue to probe to provide clarity on what types of information should be grouped or can move on, depending on how participant is responding.)*

4. What if that/those list(s) were available online - what would you call it/them?

## Section 1: Past experiences - 15-20 minutes
5. Have you ever seen or downloaded information about your health? This could be any information about your health history, about current health problem, or what you are doing to stay healthy. 

6. What did you need to do, see, or download? 

7. What did you want to learn or do with this information? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBES:* Did you want to share this information with anyone? If so, with who? For what purpose? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBES:* Did you want to keep this information for yourself? If so, what made you want to do that?

8. In the last 1-2 times you were looking online for information about your health history, current health issues, or anything about your healthcare, what kind of health information were you trying to find? 

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* What kind of information would you most want to find quickly?

	- *OPTIONAL PROBE:* Did you need to share your *(use the word the participant is using for medical records)* with anyone? If yes, with who? For what purpose? 

## Section 2: Card sort - 15-20 mins
Now we are going to do a sorting activity on a different website. 

This is a tool that helps us to understand how Veterans would group certain items. If we can uderstand how items are grouped, we can then organize them in a way that makes it easier for Veterans to find what they need quickly. For example, if you were to organize a refrigerator, you might put certain food types together - like cheeses - to make it easier for you to find a cheese you like when you need it. 

How would you prefer the link to the sorting activity? I could say it out loud for you to put into your browser, or I could put it in the Zoom chat. 
- [Card sort link](link to Optimal Workshop) - to provide; create bit.ly to make smaller and easier to dictate. 

**Instructions to open the card sort:**
* Go to the chat in zoom. It is located at the bottom of this zoom window and looks like a speech bubble.
* Click on the link for the optimal workshop card sort.
	
* On the left, we have different cards with information about health information. 
* On the right, you can drag items and group them together. Try to think of these groups as broader categories. 
* If you do not recognize what something is on one of the cards, or need me to explain it a bit more, let me know.

* I started three groups for you, including one to place cards that don’t matter to you.
	* If there is a card that doesn’t fit into any of the groups I made, you can create and name your own group. Let’s practice that.
* Take the top card that says “Allergies” and drop it into a column.
* Now take it and drop it into the white space. This will create a new group - you can type a name in at the type. Call it anything you want.
* Now you can go ahead and delete the group by clicking the red X in the upper right corner.
* Any questions?

* Organize cards in a way that makes sense to you
	* We will start at the top left and work our way through the cards, while we are moving them, help me out by “thinking out loud” so that I can understand why you might want to group things together.

10. *(If participant created groups):* Can you explain why you decided to create that group? 

11. *PROBE FOR UNDERSTANDING OF DIFFERENT CARDS AND TERMS, IF PARTICIPANT NOT EXPLAINING. TERMS COULD INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO):
* Blue Button
* VA Health Summary
* Medical Images
* Reports
* Labs/Tests
* Procedures
* Vitals
* Admissions summaries
* Discharge summaries
* Pre-visit summaries
* After-visit summaries
* Radiology
* Pathology
* Hematology

- When complete: Please go ahead and click the finish button so we can save these groupings. It’ll be anonymous. 

*For AT users - moderator carries out the card sorting under the direction of the AT user. Will require creating smaller groups so as to not overload participant. Will create a separate Optimal Workshop card sort for this scenario that includes less cards.*

**Moderator notes:**

- We are not concerned with prioritizing cards within the grouping.

## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes
*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

12. *(IF using a screen reader)* If you wanted to share your thoughts on this web page with the VA, how would you do it? *(Feedback button on bottom right of page that's not the home page / ___________)*
     1. Have you *ever* done this before?
     2. If so, how and when?
     3. Could you please go back to the original web page you opened? How would you share your thoughts on this web page?
     4. *(Want to see if screen reader users can/will use the Medallia feedback button)*

13. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 

## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to learn about Veterans so we can improve the online tools that we provide.

If you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future research session like this one, you can pass along the web link that you'll receive in your email from our team. 

Thank you so much again, and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day!
