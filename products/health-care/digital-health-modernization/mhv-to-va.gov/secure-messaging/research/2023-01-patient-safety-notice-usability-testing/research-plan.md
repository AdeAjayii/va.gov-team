# Research Plan for HMI team, Secure Messaging, January 2023

## Background

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, My HealtheVet (MHV) will be moved to VA.gov. We developed and tested a prototype of what Secure Messaging in MHV on VA.gov could look like on desktop and on a mobile device in June and July 2022 then iterated on the designs and conducted a second round of testing in November 2022. During the round 2 usability testing of Secure Messaging, we found that participants did not notice some or all the patient safety message. We also found that 1/3 of participants who were asked did not understand the connotation of "crisis" in the 988 sentence.

### Veteran Journey

This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:

- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

### Research Goals

The goals of this study are to:

- Identify Veterans' tolerance for the interstitial screen.
- Identify any usability issues with the patient safety message flow.
- Measure Veterans' understanding of when using Secure Messaging is appropriate.
- Measure Veterans' understanding of the mental health help available.

### Research Questions

1. How will Veterans react to the new compose/reply/edit draft flow? Will the interstitial page be identified as a pain point?
2. Does the new flow improve the likelihood that the safety message will be noticed and read? How much time do Veterans spend on the interstitial before advancing?
3. Does the safety message help Veterans understand when secure messaging is not the appropriate communication method?
  1. How do Veterans interpret "Do you need help now?"?
  2. What circumstances do Veterans consider an urgent question?
  3. How do Veterans describe someone who should connect with VCL rather than use Secure Messaging?
4. Do Veterans value the links to 911, the VCL, VA facilities?

### Hypothesis

_Hypothesis 1:_ Veterans will tolerate the new flow with the interstitial page.

_Hypothesis 2:_ The patient safety message placed within the flow on a separate page will increase the likelihood that it will be noticed and read.

_Hypothesis 3:_ The safety message will help Veterans understand when to seek more immediate help than what Secure Messaging provides.

_Hypothesis 4:_ Veterans will value the links to 911, and the VCL. There will be mixed reactions on the VA facilities link.

### Method

We will conduct moderated usability testing interviews in which we will ask users to navigate the prototype, observe their behavior, and ask follow-up prompts as needed.

### Location

Data collection will be remote. We will use Zoom.
