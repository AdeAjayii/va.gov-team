   - Google Analytics - determine transactions that are available or could be available
   - Domo - for dashboard view of analytics
   - VSSC - VHA-led reporting tool mostly based on data in CDW that comes from VistA.  Health Tools team has had success in working with this group to get reports built to help track real-time use and type of use for a product.
