## Moderator Logistics
-	2-3 days before the session
-	Review guidelines for moderators
-	Send guidelines for notetakers
-	Send guidelines for observers
-	Ensure prototype(s) are prepared and Perigean will share them with participants
<br/>
<br/>

## Day of the Session
-	Prepare prototype on your device and be ready for screen sharing if necessary
-	Log into the Perigean Zoom meeting (you will be the host).
-	Turn on transcriptions by clicking the LIVE TRANSCRIPT button in the bottom toolbar, then, in the Live Transcription section, click the ENABLE button.
-	Prepare yourself and your space for a video interview by clearing clutter (on screen and around you), ensuring you have good lighting, and muting distractions like Slack notifications.
-	Use headphones.
-	Review goals and research questions for this study in the research plan.
-	Starting the session.
-	If the participant doesn't show up in the first few minutes, reach out to Perigean on Slack.
-	Turn your camera on, but don't require the Veteran to turn their camera on, it's up to them. If they choose to have their camera off, ask if they'd prefer you turn your's off.
-	Where applicable, confirm the participant is able to hear and see you.
-	Go through the consent process slowly and intentionally. Remind the participant of their autonomy and choice.
-	You can only record the session if the participant gives you permission to record. Once you start recording, you must let the participant know they're being recorded and have them acknowledge that they give permission. Remember to hit record to cloud.
-	Ask if participants are okay with notetakers and observers joining the session. If they are, add them to the meeting and ensure they are on camera with their name visible on the screen. Introduce them to the participant. Then, ask all third parties to turn off their cameras so you can begin.
-	Ensure everyone except the participant is on mute.

## Introduction - 5 minutes
1.	Thanks for joining us today! My name is [**YOUR NAME**] and I'm a researcher at the VA.
2.	I also have a few colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we invite them, I'd like to tell you more about what we're doing today.
3.	Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
4.	This entire session should take about 1 hour. I'd like to make sure I don't take too much of your time, so I may occasionally move us along so we can cover everything we're hoping to talk to you about.
5.	In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
6.	Today, you'll be interacting with a prototype. This is basically like a pretend version of the website. It might not work exactly how you expect. For example, you'll be able to click on somethings on your screen, but not all of them. We use prototypes to help us test things before we decide what to make real, and what to change.
7.	If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.
8.	Perigean did ask for your consent to allow people to observe today, but I'd like to confirm. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
9.	**If participant says, no:** Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
10.	**If participant says, yes:** Admit observers.
11.	**Then, briefly introduce all observers while they keep their cameras on and microphones off. If you have time and prefer to, you can ask the observers and notetakers to introduce themselves instead.**
12.	**Then, ask all observers to turn off their cameras for the rest of the session.**
13.	Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we finish analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
14.	**If yes:** Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
15.	**Start recording.**
16.	I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
<br/>
<br/>

## Warm-up: - 3 minutes
I'd like to start by learning more about your experience reviewing information about what was discussed during your medical appointment. 
1.	Do you, or the Veteran you care for, recall receiving paperwork as you left your appointment, or reviewing online information that provided an overview of what occurred during your medical appointment or procedure? [**Moderator Note:** Use You, or the Veteran you care for, depending on who the participant is.]  

    -  a.	[**If answered yes**, ask these questions. **Otherwise**, skip to question 2.] 
  
    -  b.  Why did you review that paperwork or online content?
  
    -  c.	What information did you review?
  
    -  d.	Do you recall if any particular appointment type or procedure made you take a closer look at this paperwork or online information?
  
2.	What would you call or name something like that?
<br/>
<br/>

## Task 1: Initial Reactions to the AVS Interface - 7 minutes
- 	Great, next I’d like to get your opinion on a prototype of a section on the VA.gov website.
-  I'm going to send you a link to this prototype in the Zoom chat. Since this is a prototype for testing purposes only, it may not work as you may expect even though it may look like the actual VA.gov website.
- Okay, I've just sent you a link in the chat.  Please open the Zoom chat and click on that link. [**Moderator Note:** Help participant with the prototype if necessary. If the participant is unable to share their screen, then share your screen and follow the participant’s instructions.]
-	Now pretend that today is June 1st, 2023 and you are Hector.  You had an appointment this morning at 11:00 am with Dr. Nutt, your primary care physician, at the Puget Sound VA facility. A few hours have passed since your appointment, and you forgot what your doctor's instructions were. Use this prototype to find out what Dr. Nutt and you discussed at your appointment. Please think aloud as you are trying to find this information. 
- 	[**Notetaker:** 1. Note where participant navigates to. 2. Note if participant navigates to “Care Summaries” or “Appointments”?]
- [**Moderator Note:** Only assist if they have difficulty locating the After-visit summary. Continue with the below questions once the participant navigates to the After-visit Summary page.]

1.	Please review the info on this page and share your overall impressions. Think aloud as you review. [**Notetaker:** Note any observations about the following things: Do they open the accordions? How far down the page do they scroll? What do they comment on as confusing or valuable without prompting?]
    - a.	[**Moderator Note:** If participant finds anything confusing, ask the following: What do each of those terms mean to you?]
    - b.	Would you use or not utilize this page and why? 
<br/>
<br/>

## Task 2: Your appointment on June 1, 2023 - 7 minutes  
Now, I would like you to focus on the “Your appointment on June 1, 2023” section. Please review the section and please talk aloud as you are reviewing. And then, I’ll ask you a few questions as you move through.
1.	Can you provide an example of how you might utilize the information within this section?
2.	Are there any terms that seem unfamiliar or confusing to you?
    - a.	[**Moderator Note:** If participant encounters confusing or unfamiliar wording ask the following: Using your own words, how would you define those terms?]
3.	If you could provide a definition of the information that is included within the “You were diagnosed with” section, How would you define that information?
    - a.	So, the naming that section “You were diagnosed with” makes sense to you, or do you think that another name or title would make more sense or be more descriptive? [**Moderator Note:** if need be, ask participant if “Health conditions you discussed” make more sense as a label for that section?
Makes more sense than “You were diagnosed with” their feedback on the label
    - b.	Then what would you call it?
    - c.	How valuable or not valuable do you find this section? Why?
4.	Next, please scroll down again. [**Moderator Note:** Stop them at. “Medications ordered for administration in clinic”] 
    - a. What does the information under “Medications ordered for administration in Clinic” mean to you? [**Moderator Note:** If what they describe doesn’t match the intention of the section, then ask: What if I told you that this section displays medications you took or were administered while you were at your appointment? 
[**Placeholder Note:** If content comes back with other wording to try, then add that in as a question here.]
    - b.	Does the “Medications ordered for administration in clinic” title makes sense considering the information that is displayed?
5.	Ask participants to stop and open the glossary and review the information while they are talking aloud. [**Moderator Note:** Try to get general feedback on the glossary terms.]
    - a. [**Moderator Note:** If participant comments on term, ask “what does that mean to you?” If what they describe doesn’t match the intention of the section, then ask: What if I told you that this section was supposed [*Improvise-** because the dialogue depends on the participant’s previous answer.]
6.	How would useful or not useful do you find the information in “Medications ordered for administration in clinic”?
    - a.	If they click on what these meds mean and we can ask them and get general feedback.
<br/>
<br/>

## Task 3: Your Treatment Plan from this appointment - 7 minutes
Now, I would like you to focus on the “Your Treatment Plan from this appointment” section. Please review this section by slowly scrolling through and thinking out loud again. 
1.	How would you utilize the information within this section?
2.	Are there any words that seem unfamiliar or confusing to you?
    - a.	[**Moderator Note:** If participant encounters confusing or unfamiliar wording ask the following: What do each of those terms mean to you?]
3.	Okay great, so how would you describe the information under “Medications and Supplies”?
    - a.	How does the “Medications and Supplies” information in this section differ from “Medications ordered for administration in clinic” under the previous section “Your appointment on June 1, 2023”?
    - b.	[**Moderator Note:** If what they describe doesn’t match the intention of the section, then ask: Okay, this section was supposed to display only the medications that were given to you during the appointment?]
c.	How valuable, or not valuable, do you find this section to be? Why?
<br/>
<br/>

## Task 4: Your key medical records– 10 minutes
Now, I would like you to scroll to “Your key medical records”.  And again, please review this section by talking aloud while you are scrolling through.
1.	Can you provide an example of how you might utilize the information within this section?
2.	Are there any terms that seem unfamiliar or confusing to you?
    - a.	[**Moderator Note:** If participant encounters confusing or unfamiliar wording ask the following: Using your own words, how would you define these terms?].
3.  Okay, please continue to scroll further. [**Moderator Note:** Stop them at “Recall Appointments”] What is your understanding of “Recall Appointments”?
    - a.	[**Moderator Note:** If what they describe doesn’t match the intention of the section, then ask: What if I told you that a “Recall Reminder” was created during this appointment?]
    - b.	How helpful or not helpful is this information to you? Why?
    - c.	[**Placeholder Note:** If content comes back with other wording to try, then add that in as a question here.]

4.	Okay please scroll down a little further. Under “Problem List”, what does this information tell you? 
    - a.	[**Moderator Note:** If what they describe doesn’t match the intention of the section, then say: Okay, this section is supposed to display the “Problems” that were discussed during this appointment; does that make sense, or is that confusing?]
    - b.	How useful or not useful do you find this information? Why?


5.	Great, please slowly scroll down again. [**Moderator Note:** Stop them at “My medications”] What does the “my Medications” in this section tell you?

    - a.	How does the “My medications” information in this section differ from the information in the “medications and supplies” in the Your Treatment Plan from this appointment” section above?
    - b.	How would you utilize or not utilize this information?
    - c.	[**Placeholder Note:** If content comes back with other wording to try, then add that in as a question here.]

## [Can cut questions if running late] Task 5: More Information – 5 minutes
1.	What would you expect to find under “More Information”?
2.	Okay, go ahead and click on it and look at the whole section, and then, please share aloud what you see.
3.	Is there anything you see that is unclear or confusing?
4.	Is there anything you’d add or take away from that information?
5.	Let’s scroll to the “More help and health information” section. Is there anything you’d like to see added to that section?
<br/>
<br/>

## Task 6: Navigating to Another AVS – 10 minutes
Okay let’s view information from another appointment you had in the past. How would you go about doing that? [**Notetaker:** Observe how the participant navigates to previous pages. Do they use the browser’s back feature, breadcrumbs, or the menu’s sub-navigation. Do they have difficulty finding another After-Visit Summary?]
1.	On a scale from 1 to 5 (with 1 being very easy and 5 being very difficult), how easy or difficult was it to navigate to view other information from another day?
2.	[**Moderator Note:** Only ask the following questions if they are in the appointments section, skip if they are in the “care summaries” section.] 
Please navigate back to the page with all of your appointments listed. I want to highlight some links of this page.
    - a.	How would you describe what your saw under the “Past” link?
    - b.	What do you expect to see if you click on the “Upcoming” link?
    - c.	What do you expect to see if you click on the “Pending” link?
<br/>
<br/>

## Task 7: Insights into Notifications – 7 minutes
Okay, so we will move on from this prototype to another topic. We’re going to talk about notifications that you might want to receive about your After-Appointment Summaries. Pretend that you received the following message:

   **Subject:** New After-visit Summary
   
   **Contents:** A summary of your recent appointment(s) is now available on MyHealtheVet Login to review the summary.

1.	Do you find this notification helpful or not helpful? Why?
2.	How would you prefer to receive this notification (email, text message, phone call, etc.)?
3.	If you had multiple appointments in one day, would you want one after appointment notification for each appointment that day or would you want all the appointments combined into one message?
<br/>
<br/>

## Closing Questions – 3 minutes
1.	If you could change one thing about the After Appointment Visit summary, what would that be?
2.	And lastly, do you have any questions for me?
3.	Okay, great! That is all the questions I have for you today.
<br/>
<br/>

## Thank you - 2 minutes
1.	We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
2.	Before you go, I do want to make sure it's clear that everything we did today wasn't real. And you haven’t really accessed your VA.gov account.
3.	Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
4.	Thank you so much for your time today, and enjoy the rest of your day!
<br/>
<br/>

## Emergency Exit
•	Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.
•	Blame technology: I'm so sorry, but I just learned that the prototype we'll be reviewing today is unexpectedly not working. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time.
