## Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to get feedback from Veterans and caregivers on the after visit summary AVS MVP for My Healthe Vet on VA.gov about the ease of use and how well the AVS meets expectations on the following criteria:
- if Veteran/caregivers understand the information displayed within the AVS.
- what notifications Veterans expect to get about AVS.

 <br> 
 <br> 

 ##  Research Questions
- What are Veterans’/caregivers’ past experience with an AVS in either paper form or online?
- Can Veterans/caregivers easily find the AVS within the Appointments section and/or the Care Summaries
Notes section for a particular appointment?
- How do they navigate to an AVS; is it via Appointments or Care summaries and notes?
- Are any sections or terms displayed within the AVS confusing to Veterans/caregivers?
- Is there any information missing that Veterans/caregivers expect to see in an AVS? Or information
displayed that Veterans/caregivers weren't expecting to see?
- Is the information and layout displayed consistent with Veterans’/caregivers’ mental models?
- Do Veterans/caregivers prefer one notification for each AVS or one notification for all appointments in
one day?
- What information do Veterans/caregivers expect in an AVS notification?

 ## Method
- This research was conducted as a remote moderated study on the Zoom platform. Each session was 1
hour in length, where each participant was asked to interact with a Figma prototype built for mobile devices.

- When time allowed, most participants were asked to complete 7 tasks interacting with the prototype, while the
moderator asked them questions to gain understanding of expectations and satisfaction.
