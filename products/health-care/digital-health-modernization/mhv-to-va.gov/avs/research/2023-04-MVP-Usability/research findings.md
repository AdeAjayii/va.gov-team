## How this research maps to the Veteran journey
- Taking care of myself
- Putting down roots
- Retiring
- Aging

   <br> 
 <br> 

## OCTO DE goals that this research supports
- Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov.
- Veterans can manage their health services online.
- VFS teams can build and deploy high quality products for Veterans on the Platform.
- Usage of digital, self-service tools.

 <br> 
 <br> 
 
## Research goals
The purpose of this research is to get feedback from Veterans and caregivers on the after visit summary AVS MVP for My Healthe Vet on VA.gov about the ease of use and how well the AVS meets expectations on the following criteria:
- if Veteran/caregivers understand the information displayed within the AVS.
- what notifications Veterans expect to get about AVS.

 <br> 
 <br> 

 ##  Research questions
- What are Veterans’/caregivers’ past experience with an AVS in either paper form or online?
- Can Veterans/caregivers easily find the AVS within the Appointments section and/or the Care Summaries
Notes section for a particular appointment?
- How do they navigate to an AVS; is it via Appointments or Care summaries and notes?
- Are any sections or terms displayed within the AVS confusing to Veterans/caregivers?
- Is there any information missing that Veterans/caregivers expect to see in an AVS? Or information
displayed that Veterans/caregivers weren't expecting to see?
- Is the information and layout displayed consistent with Veterans’/caregivers’ mental models?
- Do Veterans/caregivers prefer one notification for each AVS or one notification for all appointments in
one day?
- What information do Veterans/caregivers expect in an AVS notification?

 <br> 
 <br> 

 ## Method
- This research was conducted as a remote moderated study on the Zoom platform. Each session was 1
hour in length, where each participant was asked to interact with a Figma prototype built for mobile devices.

- When time allowed, most participants were asked to complete 7 tasks interacting with the prototype, while the
moderator asked them questions to gain understanding of expectations and satisfaction.

 ##  Key findings 
 

### Past AVS Experience

1. All participants routinely reviewed information about their appointments, tests, and upcoming tasks to complete. The method they utilized to access this information differed.

    * My HealtheVet: 7
    * VA AVS paper printout: 4
    * Non-VA AVS: 2
    * Lab specific paper reports: 2
    * VA AVS (unknown if digital or paper printout): 1
    * Printout of upcoming appointments: 1

    **Recommendation:** Spread awareness via the changebmanagement process that a digital AVS is available on VA.gov.
 <br> 
 <br> 

2. The information in the current VA AVS matches the information that participants routinely review after an appointment. 

    * Information that participants routinely review:
        * Labs: 6
        * Medications: 4
        * Provider notes/what provider documented: 3
        * Appointments: 2
        * Instructions before an upcoming procedures, radiology, and tests: 2
        * Results from a procedure and radiology: 2
        * Blue button: 1
        * Vitals: 1
        * Terminology: 1
        * Medical tasks that need to be completed: 1

      **Note:** Participants had not reviewed the prototype yet when they shared this information.
  <br> 
 <br>     

3. The name "After-visit summary" matches Veteran/caregiver mental models. Terms participants used to name an AVS:

 
    * After appointment confirmation or Post OP: 1
        * After-visit summary: 2
        * Summary report: 1
        * Appointment review: 1
        * Lab print-out: 1
        * An overview or summary: 1
        * A review of medical records: 1
        * Doctor’s notes: 1
        * A visit summary: 1
        * Lab results or radiology results: 1
        * A summary of visit: 1
        * Prior-office visit information: 1

    **Recommendation:** Keep referring to this experience as the "After After-visit summary."
 <br> 
 <br> 
  
4. 7 Veterans mentioned that they sometimes don’t receive appointment summaries or lab results until 48-72 hours following the appointment.

         "In person notes are loaded, usually 2 to 3 days after the initial visit, and so
          sometimes, they make people have to wait for the after visit summary; so I
          request my husband to bring them to me, so that I know what transpired"-Caregiver participant

    **Recommendation:** Within the AVS, add content to inform Veteran/caregiver that lab results are still in progress and send the AVS notification as soon as it is available.
</br>


### Information Architecture
</br>

5. Participants validated past research that Veterans/caregivers expect AVSs within appointments and care summaries and notes.
 <br> 
 <br>

<img 
width="709" alt="Finding 5" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/11db9697-a91c-41f3-97bc-1beab1c12369">

<br>
<br>
    **Recommendation:** Don't change the current information architecture plan to include AVS within appointments and care summaries and notes.



6. 2 out of 6 participants were confused by the label "Schedule and manage appointments,"
because the appointment they were looking for occurred in the past.

        “My first thought would be to schedule and manage appointments, but I already had [the appointment]. So, it's not really scheduling it,
         but I don't see anything else that would be relevant.”
   
 <br>
<br>  
<img 
 width="152" alt="Finding 6" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/2161f2fc-b425-4731-bdc6-7fc10223afd3">

<br>
<br>

 **Recommendation:** Review past appointment research into this label and add this as a research question to future studies. If evidence continues to suggest Veteran/caregiver confusion, then make changes to the label.
 
<br>
<br>

7. When already on the AVS page, 6 participants thought they needed to click on the "Details" link to view the needed to click on the "Details" link to view the AVS.

<br>
<br>
    * Example workflow from one participant:
       * Reached the AVS and didn't scroll down the page.
       * Chose the "Details" link, where they expected to see doctor's recommendations, follow ups, and referrals.

<br>
<br>
<img 
 width="161" alt="Findings 7" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/2e665ce8-fa23-46bb-b6eb-9466a097ca75">
 
 <br> 
 <br>
     **Recommendation:** Remove the "Details" link.
 <br> 
 <br>

8. 7 participants thought that they had to click o the "Details" link to access doctor's instructions or results.

        “It's not allowing me to click on details…It will actually show me the summary notes of the visit, and then, when I click on the lab work well, I don't know if that 
         lab work is part of the 9:50 appointment, or not, because it has a 11:30 a.m. time. I wouldn’t know if that's the next procedure that the doctor wants me to have 
   done.”


<img 
 width="169" alt="Findings 8" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/2cc8f83e-d31f-43bf-a748-bcb76d63b8b2">
<br> 
 <br>

    **Recommendation:** Remove the "Details" link.

 <br> 
 </br>

9. 10 participants easily navigated from one AVS to another using the back breadcrumb. Some of the other locations the 3 participants tried to click on to navigate were:
Collapsing the AVS accordions Scrolling to the bottom of the page Clicking the Hector profile icon.




<img 
 width="126" alt="Findings 9" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/9ac19b7b-29e5-48d1-b00f-4344e342552c">

 <br> 
 <br>
    **Recommendation:** The navigational structure (back buttons) can remain the same.
   <br> 
 <br>



10.3 out of 6 participants, who reviewed the appointments section, expected the "pending"list to include referrals, recall, follow up, or imaging appointments that still need to be scheduled. All participants correctly assumed this list weren't confirmed appointments.

        "I would expect to see the...ones that...I've either requested myself...or another provider has put into the system, but they haven't been confirmed yet, either by 
         me or the other person."



<img
 width="142" alt="Findings 10" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/a0fdb8ad-2882-4322-b249-cd17d0a22021">
 

    **Recommendation:** Conduct further research when adding referrals and recalls to the appointment list.

 <br> 
 <br>

### AVS Content
 <br> 
 <br>

11. Overall, the majority of participants had a very positive response to the AVS and stated it contains a lot of useful information.
    
        "It looks pretty thorough, and I like the way it's sectioned out…I think it kind of gets more to the summary of everything without having to read through a whole 
         couple of paragraphs to figure out what was going on." “It looks like it will give me quicker access to the information that I'm looking for.”
 <br> 
 <br>   


<img 
 width="144" alt="Finding 11" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/46494bef-bd9e-410b-aa67-955c4fda61b2">

 <br> 
 <br>
 

12. A third of the participants saw the AVS as a place to confirm that their providers understood what they were trying to convey during the appointment.
 
        "I review that so that I can see how the doctor, or whoever I saw, interpreted what I was saying; if they heard what I intended to convey.”

    **Recommendation:** Explore ways to connect/crosslink AVS and other care summaries and notes, such as progress notes, so a complete story of what the provider understood can be shared with the Veteran/caregiver.

 <br> 
 <br>


13. Even though half of the participants stated the instructions within the "Your treatment plan from this appointment" section were helpful, half of participants also made suggestions to add information.
    
    * Examples of information requested:
       * What to do for upcoming tests (or knowing that they don't have to do anything)
       * Phone numbers and addresses of imaging facilities and pharmacies.
       * Deadlines and turn around times for lab work before certain procedures or appointments.
       * Whether tests can be done on a walk in basis or if an appointment is required.



<img 
 width="125" alt="Findings 13" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/4dda1423-e0cf-489e-a9e7-f489287ca0f3">

 
     **Recommendation:** Complete additional research to understand the technical and Veteran value of these requests.

<br> 
<br>


14. 8 participants didn't know what a recall appointment was.

        "Recall appointments are appointments that someone has to come in multiple times for something; maybe they need to come in weekly for their blood pressure… they 
         need to have their blood drawn every2 weeks to check or something like that, just to kind of remind people because life gets busy". "I don't know, because VA 
         doesn't do walk ins to see your primary care. I'm not sure what a recall appointment is."



<img 
 width="187" alt="Finding 14" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/9d0a23f6-e8cd-4e3d-b482-43202a6ffd86">

    **Recommendation:** Eliminate the term "recall" for these appointment types. Provide a more accurate and descriptive name for these type of appointments.

<br> 
<br>


15. 4 Participants incorrectly defined the "You were diagnosed with" section.

    * They defined "You were diagnosed with" as all new diagnoses from this appointment and past diagnoses from other appointments.
    * When asked about the alternative section title, "Health conditions you discussed," participants defined that section as concerns and conditions discussed with their provider at this appointment, which may or may not be official diagnoses.
    * Participants commented that both "You were diagnosed with" and "Health conditions you discussed" were valuable to review within an AVS.
  


<img 
 width="131" alt="Finding 15" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/9d6cc760-97d6-4f04-95bb-3223546a08d9">

    **Recommendation:** Explore an alternate title to the "You were diagnosed with" section.

<br> 
<br>



16. 7 participants understood that the “Problem list” showed all their diagnoses, but some saw overlap or confusion with the "You were diagnosed with" section.
    
           "I guess these are the things that you tested me for and these are the problems that you saw."
 
           "I feel like, if you are going to keep the problem list...then you can just take away the ["You were diagnosed with"] section."
 


<img 
 width="167" alt="Finding 16" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/d7cc7d01-2382-4cf3-b349-04701d3bab46">
 

    **Recommendation:** Explore how to remove confusion between the "You were diagnosed with" and "Problems list" sections.

<br> 
<br>


17. Half of the participants didn't understand at least one medical term and wanted more information to educate themselves.
    
         "Respirations...what does that mean?"

        "I would probably have to look up some of this. [Hypertension]…I don’t know what that is. Could they put a link, what does this mean? Like a
         glossary similar to the medication section. That way that I don’t have to get on Google and diagnosis myself that I’m dying …like we all do."
    
          “The PO… that is unclear…Oh. Yeah, that [means] Post Office.”



<img 
 width="152" alt="Finding 17" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/f200d734-7857-4261-9f86-0644fcefd4d2">

    **Recommendation:** Complete a content review of medical terminology within the AVS to identify areas for more plain language. Ensure that if clinicians entered patient friendly descriptions, then displaythem within the AVS. In addition, expand patient education articles linking within the AVS. For example, make hypertension a link to an article describing the condition.

<br> 
<br>


18. 6 participants would like their vitals to be displayed in Imperial/U.S. standard measurements instead of the metric system.
    
       "The temperature in Celsius is not helpful for me...I got to go get a converter for that.“

        “The height and weight I prefer to have in inches and pounds if I'm the one using it. Obviously, the medical people probably want it [in metric].”

        “I don't know what the temperature is…instead of Fahrenheit. What is 36.4 C?”



<img 
 width="190" alt="Finding 18" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/664aee6a-13bf-4a9f-a429-195daded3187">

     **Recommendation:**  Ensure that the default configuration is set to Imperial/U.S. standard, which the VA AVS system already provides.

<br> 
<br>

19. 4 participants saw value in sharing their AVS with non- VA providers. They specifically discussed wanting to print out copies.

        “I could print it out…my dad… also uses the VA, we can go onto his site, and I can see what he is allergic to and help his providers…So, it'd be easy… a nice thing to print out.”

        “If I were to see a provider outside the VA that would need my medication list, this is a great reference for me to pull and either print out.”


    **Recommendation:** Ensure that the AVS product has a good print stylesheet and an accessible, downable PDF.
<br> 
<br>


### Medications
<br> 
<br>

20. 8 participants interpreted the "Medications administered at the clinic" section incorrectly.

    * Participants assumed the medication:
         * would be received during a later visit.
         * was given at the clinic, but also required them to take more later at home after picking up a prescription.
         * would either be administered during the procedure or mailed to them to take before arriving to an appointment.
  
        “That's what's being used during the procedure…so, they ordered it…and said… you… [are] going to get this in the mail; you need to make sure you take this and it's
going to be telling you how to take it. And you take it before you come in for the procedure.”

        “It says, give…[not] given…[it should] say the time…and a date…It doesn't say if it's given or not…so I'm thinking…It's saying that he hasn't taken it yet.”



<img 
 width="307" alt="Findings 20" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/5ad67778-380e-4dac-8117-5ce358b0d0c9">

    **Recommendation:** Change the section title and label to something More plain language and understandable.

<br> 
<br>


21. The "My medications" section met the expectations of most participants.

        "This is much more informative, I like this layout, or I like the amount of [information]...If I forgot how much to take, I could refer to information relayed here. I guess the other was just a summary, this is more like a full history".

<img 
 width="179" alt="Finding 21" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/808bf2e2-ff32-4b9d-bbb0-30898a88da3f">

<br> 
<br>

22. Approximately half of all participants were either confused about the difference between all three of the medications sections or wanted the sections combined into one section. 

        "You’ve got multiple places to get what you’re looking for. Again, that this goes back to the redundancy…If I'm looking the prescription information, I shouldn't have to go to 3 different spots and find prescription information."



<img 
 width="332" alt="Finding 22" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/8cb762fb-f2d7-4f11-8845-2bd29a91fd20">

     **Recommendation:** Explore clearer labels to eliminate confusion across different medication sections. Explore a combined medication sections.


<br> 
<br>

23. Some participants asked for additional instructions with their medications.

    *They requested:
       * what condition they are taking the medication for.
       * instructions on when to take it.
       * why they stopped taking a medication and what the adverse reactions were.
         
        “I want to know what I was taking Tylenol for.” 



<img width="319" alt="Findings 23" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/d9a92e8c-0125-4f9d-a2b8-633e842580d2">

    **Recommendation:** Display the existing indication field. Research the other requests further.

<br> 
<br>

### Notifications
<br> 
<br>

24. All participants wanted a notification (email, text, etc.) that their AVS was ready to review.

    * Modality preferences:
       * 3 Text only
       * 2 Email only
       * 7 Either text or email
         

    **Recommendation:** Create AVS notification for each modality, such as email, text, push, or in app notification. Also, create an associated notification preference.

<br> 
<br>

25. Participants were equally divided between receiving one notification for each AVS or receiving all AVSs for a given day, together in one notification.

        "I would prefer all in one; because then that way,...I'm not waiting to see that each one comes…and I'm counting 3 separate ones. I count one notification, I click into that, and I can find anything that happened during that day.”

        “I would like one for each visit, because what if the first doctor I saw…sent…the after care summary. But then my third doctor of the day well, he didn’t…send that in;...then I don't have to keep reminding myself to check back and look for it.”
    

    **Recommendation:** Start with separate notification for each AVS. Then, explore expanding to one notification for each day in the future as another option.

<br> 
<br>


## Secondary findings
<br> 
<br>

1. 2 participants mentioned it would be helpful having more phone information.

    * When 1 participant was asked if the information in the recall appointments was helpful, she replied there is no phone number to call:

        “Again…there’s no phone number to call."

    * 1 participant suggested having live phone links to call:

        “If you made the phone number a link, so if…I’m looking at it on my phone,…If we just hit the phone number and it calls.”


<img 
 width="263" alt="SF 1" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/1ec3ccb5-5368-4040-a6d0-4b472bad8aa4">

     **Recommendation:** Add phone number within the appointments section and make it clickable.


<br> 
<br>

2. 3 participants had a hard time interpreting what the lab results meant for them; they didn't know what to do with this information. 

          "I don't know how to read the lab results, so I don't know what that means".

          "I know it gives a reference range, but I never know….if it's good or bad…I always look at the results and I never know how to interpret them, and I always have to call the Doc back.”




<img 
 width="139" alt="SF 2" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/32acf8d6-d224-4efb-ab55-66dfc66a175f">

     **Recommendation:** Share this information with the medical records team that is working on VA.gov lab results.

<br> 
<br>


3. 2 participants didn't understand the clinic name.

        "The clinic with the colors might be confusing if you're not aware that you're assigned…by color. You're like, I don't know what that means. I don't have any idea what color I am."

        “I don't know what Red 4C is; if they're really telling you, what floor to go to…[I would like to see] just a room number… with conventional room numbers."




<img 
 width="194" alt="SF 3" src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/108754235/fc0a41f4-b6ff-4666-9943-05398f2bc6c2">

 Recommendation: Make clinic names more user friendly or display a combination of other appointment information, such as floor and room number.

<br> 
<br>


## Recommendations to complete with MVP release


- Spread awareness via the change management process that a digital AVS is available on VA.gov.

- Keep referring to this experience as the "After visit summary."

- Don't change the current information architecture plan to include AVS within appointments and care summaries and notes.

- Remove the "Details" link from the design.

- The navigational structure (back buttons) can remain the same.

- Ensure that the default configuration is set to Imperial/U.S. standard, which the VA AVS system already provides.

- Ensure that if clinicians entered patient friendly descriptions, then display them within the AVS.

## Recommendations to consider for a phase 2 release


- Review past appointment research into this label and add this as a research question to future studies. If evidence continues to suggest Veteran/caregiver confusion, then make changes to the label.
  
- Ensure that the AVS product has a good print stylesheet and an accessible, downable PDF.

- Conduct further research when adding referrals and recalls to the appointment list.

- Eliminate the term "recall" for these appointment types. Provide a more accurate and descriptive name for these type of appointments.

- Explore an alternate title to the "You were diagnosed with" section.

- Explore how to remove confusion between the "You were diagnosed with" and "Problems list" sections.

- Change the "Medications administered at the clinic" section title and label to something more plain language and understandable.

- Complete a content review of medical terminology within the AVS to identify areas for more plain language. Ensure that if clinicians entered patient friendly descriptions, then display them within the AVS. In addition, expand patient education articles linking within the AVS.

## Recommendations to complete in a later iteration by the AVS team

- Explore ways to connect/crosslink AVS and other care summaries and notes, such as progress notes, so a complete story of what the provider understood can be shared with the
Veteran/caregiver.

- Complete additional research to understand the technical and Veteran value of the additional information requests to the "Your treatment plan from this appointment" section.


- Expand patient education articles linking within the AVS. For example, make hypertension a link to an article describing the condition.

- Explore clearer labels to eliminate confusion across the different medication sections. Explore a combined medication sections.

- Research additional medication instruction needs further.

- Add phone number within the appointments section.

## Recommendations for later iterations and will require other teams

- Within the AVS, add content to inform Veteran/caregiver that lab results are still in progress and send the AVS notification as soon as it is available. Review past appointment research into this "Schedule and manage appointments" label and add this as a research question to future studies. If evidence continues to suggest Veteran/caregiver confusion, then make changes to the label (Appointments and AVSs teams)

- Explore ways to connect/crosslink AVS and other care summaries and notes, such as progress notes, so a complete story of what the provider understood can be shared with
the Veteran/caregiver. (Medical records and AVS teams)

- Make clinic names more user friendly or display a combination of other appointment information, such as floor and room number. (Appointments backendteam)

- Conduct further research when adding referrals and recalls to the appointment list. (Appointments team).

- Create AVS notification for each modality, such as email, text, push, or in app notification. Also, create an associated notification preference. (VeText , VA Authenticated Experience, and AVS teams)

- Start with separate notification for each AVS. Then, explore expanding to one notification for each day in the future as another option. (VeText , VA Authenticated Experience, and AVS teams)

- Within the AVS, add content to inform Veteran/caregiver that lab results are still in progress and send the AVS notification as soon as it is available.

    **Hypothesis** of teams needed for each item are included in the paratheses.
