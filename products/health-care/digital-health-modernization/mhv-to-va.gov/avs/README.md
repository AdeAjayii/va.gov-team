## The Problem
After Visit Summaries (AVS) serve many purposes*, including:
-	Promote patient-center, outpatient care
-	Summarize medications, appointments, tests, patient education material and other instructions
-	Enhance communication
-	Engage patients in their care
-	Improve recall of medical instructions
-	Meet electronic health record Meaningful Use criteria
Within the VA today, Veterans can be handed a printed AVS when leaving their appointment, providers can review an AVS with them during their appointment, and Veterans can view a PDF version of AVS on My HealtheVet. Now, we want to create an AVS experience on VA.gov.
