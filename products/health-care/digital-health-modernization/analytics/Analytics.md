# Analytics to inform initial user research for the Health Apartment site map
Listed here are various analytics to help drive research planning. 

### Key facts about VA health care (Source: [Ad Hoc's "VA 101"presentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/assets/VA%20101%20-%20External%20-%20Aug%202021.pdf), updated August 2021)
- VA runs the nation's largest integrated health system and only health care in the U.S. operated by the government and employing health care professionals, aside from the military and Indian Health Service
- **Serves 9.3M enrolled Veterans each year** (Does this mean of the enrolled Veterans, 9.3M use VA health care per year?)
- 1,255 healthcare facilities; 170 VA Medical Centers (VAMCs); 18 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISNs), or regional care networks.

### Veteran demographics (Source: [Ad Hoc's "VA 101"presentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/assets/VA%20101%20-%20External%20-%20Aug%202021.pdf), updated August 2021)
The demographics data comes from the U.S. Census.
-  **In 2018, there were approximately 18M Veterans in the U.S.** Half of these are considered VA Veterans, meaning they receive benefits through VA. (It's predicted that there will be 13M Veterans in 2040.)
  -  **In 2017, 9.6% of VA users were women.** Of female vets, 50% use VA services (compared to 49% utilization for male vets).
  -  **In 2017, the median age of male Veterans was 64, while the median age of female Veteran was 48.**
-  **In 2018, 9% of Veterans were women.** (It's predicted that 17% of Veterans will be women in 2040.)

### VA benefit usage (Source: [Ad Hoc's "VA 101"presentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/assets/VA%20101%20-%20External%20-%20Aug%202021.pdf), updated August 2021)
-  **In 2017, 9.8M (about 50%) of all Veterans were enrolled in at least 1 VA service.**
  -  **And Veterans aged 25-34 and 65+ were most likely to use VA benefits.**
-  **In 2018, 24% of Veterans had a service-connected disability.** A "service-connected disability" is an injury, disease, or disability either caused or aggravated by active duty.
  -  **In 2017, 707,000 Veterans had a service-connected disability rating of 100%.**
  -  30% of Veterans have an American Community Survey-defined disability. There are likely many more disabled Vets that are not identified, in part due to military culture.
  -  43% of Post-9/11 veterans have a service-connected disability – significantly higher than Veterans from other periods. Advances in battlefield medicine and rapid evacuations have resulted in more Veterans surviving wounds, but an **increase in invisible injuries like Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI).**
  -  **The most common disabilities include hearing loss, PTSD, scars, back and neck pain, and migraines.**
  -  There are **158,000 legally blind veterans, with 7,000 veterans newly blind or visually impaired each year.**
-  **In 2019, 5.38M people received disability compensation,** defined as "Monetary benefits to **Vets and survivors** based on Service-connected disability rating." Benefits include Disability Compensation, DIC (Dependent and Indemnity Compensation, also called Death benefit), and SMC (Special Monthly Comp).
