# Notes captured from the Debt Resolution Team
Meeting notes from Riley Orr, designer working on medical copays and patient statements </br>
February 15, 2022

### What exactly does “copay” mean? What are examples of things that are copays?
- A copay is the amount the Veteran pays for medical care and pharmacy services depending on their priority group and whether the treatment is connected to their service. Their priority group is determined through multiple factors including income and disability rating. 
- Examples of copays: Refilling a prescription, medical care at a community care facility

### What is Veterans’ mental model of copays?
- Veterans conceptualize their copay statements as bills. During discovery research, most of our participants called a piece of mail detailing their VA medical charges as ‘VA bill’ or ‘Billing statement’. Several also stated their bill would be sent to collections if they didn’t pay. [See this research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/apr-2021/readout.md#overwhelmingly-veterans-conceptualize-the-veteran-patient-statements-as-bills)

### Do Veterans think of their medical expenses with VA as a part of their financial business with VA – or as separate? (Examples of other financial things with VA are GI Bill payments and disability compensation. Both are payments to Veterans from VA.)
- Yes. During our discovery research, Veterans overwhelmingly expect to find all money owed to VA together. It’s also Congressionally mandated that we provide a way for Veterans to find information about all their debts in one place online, so we are currently working towards combining the existing VBA Debt Portal (education, disability compensation + pension debts) with the Medical Copay Tool. [See this research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/apr-2021/readout.md#overwhelmingly-veterans-conceptualize-the-veteran-patient-statements-as-bills)

### Please share insights from your research related to other key words (exs: “copayment,” “billing,” “bills,” “debt”) – or point us to this study.
- During a study, we asked Veterans to search for a pathway to copayment information from the homepage, they primarily looked for a variation of “bill”:
  - “Billing” / “Pay my bill” / “Pay bill” / “Pay bill here”
- They also overwhelmingly conceptualize a statement as a bill. [See this research.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/apr-2021/readout.md#veterans-looked-for-a-variety-of-keywords-when-searching-for-a-pathway-to-copayment-information-but-primarily-looked-for-bill)     

### How do Veterans usually pay copays? Through pay.gov or by mail?
- I need to dig deeper on this. I believe most people preferred paying online but they struggled with certain aspects of Pay.gov such as finding their statement’s account number. We display the account number in the Medical Copay Tool so Veterans don’t need to download their statement to find that information. 
- I recall one participant during our discovery research study that stated they’d pay by check because they were more comfortable. 

### What charges/information could a “patient statement” contain?
- Prescriptions
- Medical care

### Could a patient statement have non-medical things on it?
- Not that I’ve seen.

### Will medical expenses become part of your payment history? (Payment history now includes: disability compensation, pension, and education/GI Bill (as well as payments to survivors of Veterans or service members). [See payment history.](https://www.va.gov/va-payment-history/)
- The payment history tool shows Veterans money that VA sends them. We played around with bringing the payment history tool into the combined VBA/VHA debt portal but there aren’t plans in the immediate future to bring all 3 tools (VBA Debt Portal, Medical Copay Tool, and Payment History) together.
