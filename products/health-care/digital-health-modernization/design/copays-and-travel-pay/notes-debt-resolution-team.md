## What exactly does “copay” mean? What are examples of things that are copays?
- A copay is the amount the Veteran pays for medical care and pharmacy services depending on their priority group and whether the treatment is connected to their service. Their priority group is determined through multiple factors including income and disability rating. 
- Examples of copays: Refilling a prescription, medical care at a community care facility
