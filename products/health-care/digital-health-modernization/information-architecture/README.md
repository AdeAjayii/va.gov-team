# Digital Health Modernization README: Information Architecture 

## Mapping the health landscape 
### Products, people, and systems
We wanted to understand how Veterans think about health care, as well as the fragmented ecosystem Veterans and caregivers must navigate to get health care and disability benefits. So we started by:
* Interviewing our partners/stakeholders working on things related to health, and 
* Mapping [VA's health products, people, and systems](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1606314329344/1d6343c768f02ec0ab12eab999c331b3c64b29eb). 

We found a number of teams working on similar — or the same — functionality, as shown on the map of [products, people and systems](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1606314329344/1d6343c768f02ec0ab12eab999c331b3c64b29eb). For example, both My HealtheVet and the Cerner system have patient portals. Cerner's is called "My VA Health."
