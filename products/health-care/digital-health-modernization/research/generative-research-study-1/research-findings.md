## Background

Digital Health Modernization (DHM) builds on our [2017 Digital Modernization Strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-gov-relaunch-2018/va-gov-strategy/digitalmodernizationstrategy.pdf) to consolidate digital benefit management tools in a single place — VA.gov — and to design those tools with users.

Several developments, including the introduction of Community Care through the MISSION Act and VA’s transition to the Cerner electronic health record (EHR), have created a health-specific aim: to ensure VA’s patient portal is EHR agnostic and interoperable with outside providers while creating a consistent user experience that serves Veteran’s needs. 

With the goal of migrating the My HealtheVet (MHV) patient portal to VA.gov, our team was tasked with conducting generative research to inform our product strategy and roadmap. 

## Research Questions and Methodology

Our objective was to understand how Veterans and caregivers think about and experience VA health care and the My HealtheVet patient portal in the context of other VA benefits and non-VA health care systems. 

#### Research Questions

* **Branding and trust:** What attitudes do Veterans hold toward the MHV brand? Which aspects of the MHV brand generate trust?
* **Mental models and information architecture:** What health-related content and tools outside of the MHV patient portal do users find valuable? What do they need integrated into their experience to support end-to-end workflows? 
* **Account structure, permissions, and sharing:** Who do Veterans need to share their health information with? And how would they like to manage sharing info and granting permissions? 
* **Patient portal:** How well does the current MHV patient portal support user needs? Where are there opportunities to bridge gaps or improve on existing functionality?

#### Methodology

We conducted remote, semi-structured interviews with 23 Veterans and caregivers to understand their story. 

We then asked participants to walk us through how they would complete a series of health-related tasks. When they described doing something online, we had participants share their screen so we could observe. This allowed us to learn Veterans' and caregivers' systems of wayfinding, authentication methods, and workflows related to health. 

Tasks: 
* Ask your VA care team a question
* Refill a prescription
* Check the date of an upcoming medical exam you have for a disability claim
* Check the date of an appointment for a yearly check up with your VA care team
* Check the date of an appointmetn with a provider outside the VA
* Pay a VA health care bill, such as a copay
* Request reimbursement from the VA for traveling to your health care appointments
* Update the dependents on your VA benefits
* Update health care benefits

## Recruitment

For this generative study, participants were required to have applied for or currently be enrolled in VA health care. We then recruited based on 3 main criteria: 
1. User role
2. Era of military service/age
3. Use of VA benefits 

During synthesis, we noticed meaningful segmentation based on: 

4. How and when participants enrolled in VA health care
5. Participants' use of non-VA health care and insurance for themselves or dependents
6. Participants identifying as having cognitive impairments (including TBI, PTSD)
