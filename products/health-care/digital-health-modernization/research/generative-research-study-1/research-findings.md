## Background

Digital Health Modernization (DHM) builds on our [2017 Digital Modernization Strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-gov-relaunch-2018/va-gov-strategy/digitalmodernizationstrategy.pdf) to consolidate digital benefit management tools in a single place — VA.gov — and to design those tools with users.

Several developments, including the introduction of Community Care through the MISSION Act and VA’s transition to the Cerner electronic health record (EHR), have created a health-specific aim: to ensure VA’s patient portal is EHR agnostic and interoperable with outside providers while creating a consistent user experience that serves Veteran’s needs. 

With the goal of migrating the My HealtheVet (MHV) patient portal to VA.gov, our team was tasked with conducting generative research to inform our product strategy and roadmap. 

## Research Questions and Methodology

Our objective was to understand how Veterans and caregivers think about and experience VA health care and the My HealtheVet patient portal in the context of other VA benefits and non-VA health care systems. 

#### Research Questions

**Branding and trust:** What attitudes do Veterans hold toward the MHV brand? Which aspects of the MHV brand generate trust?
 
**Mental models and information architecture:** What health-related content and tools outside of the MHV patient portal do users find valuable? What do they need integrated into their experience to support end-to-end workflows? 

**Account structure, permissions, and sharing:** Who do Veterans need to share their health information with? And how would they like to manage sharing info and granting permissions? 
 
**Patient portal:** How well does the current MHV patient portal support user needs? Where are there opportunities to bridge gaps or improve on existing functionality?

#### Methodology

We conducted remote, semi-structured interviews with 23 Veterans and caregivers to understand their story. 

We asked participants to walk us through how they would complete a series of health-related tasks. When they described a digital workflow, we observed participants as they demonstrated their workflows online. This allowed us to learn Veterans' and caregivers' systems of wayfinding, authentication methods, and workflows related to health.
