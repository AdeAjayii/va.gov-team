## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Megan and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to show you some ideas related to viewing and sending secure messages.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a Demo.** This is a demo and not a live website, parts may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Just let me know what you'd expect to happen in that case. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5-10 minutes
- Do you have health care through the VA?
- Do you have other benefits through the VA?
- Have you used My HealtheVet? If Yes, how often do you use it? What do you use it for? How do you access it (phone, tablet, laptop, etc)? What would you change about MHV?
- Do you use secure messaging now? What for? How often? What would you change about it?
- You got an email from the VA that there's a new way to look at all your health care needs in one place, but you can't remember what it was called. How would you find it?[if needed, direct participant to open VA.gov homepage] Where would you expect to find it on VA.gov?


*Are we dropping them into messages or will they need to navigate there?


## View messages - x minutes
- What are you seeing here?
- How long would you expect it to take to get a reply to your message?

- Let's say you remember that you had sent your cardiologist a message at the beginning of this year. If you wanted to re-read their reply, how would you find that message?
- (If they use use the navigation at the bottom of the page) Let's say that you have dozens of messages, what would you do?
- (If navigate to search) What are you seeing here? 
- What would you enter here?
- Do you ever use advanced search?
- What would you see once you hit the search button?

### Things to watch for:
- Do participants notice that the left nav are links and folders?
- Do participants see the action link "search"?
- Do participants see the < previous and next > navigation?
- *Message detail & Reply: Research whether to expand or collapse message thread.
- *Message detail & Reply: Does a user realize the message thread can expand? 
- Left nav: What should we call the Deleted folder? 
- Multi screens: Do users want to sort, filter, or scan by attachment? 
- Multi screens: How and where should the Compose button be displayed?
- Messages landing/Inbox: How does a draft message look?
- Message detail & Reply: Where do you click to expand the message thread?
- Do participants like the option of a more compressed inbox so more messages fit on a page? *Is there something in the UI or is this a research question?


## Send a new message - x minutes
- x

### Things to watch for:
- Compose and Reply: Should messages have a signature?
- Compose & Reply: Add text telling user it could take 3 days to get a reply.
- Form fields: Are there error scenarios we should test?
- Compose / Message preferences: Do Veterans want a signature field?
- Compose and Reply: Work on attach message UX + design that alert. 
- Multi screens: What do users mean by “provider”? An individual or a group?
- Compose: Would changing how the “To” field works confuse Veterans?  
- Multi screens: What do users mean by “provider”? An individual or a group?
- Compose and Reply: Can you edit the list of names under "To"? If so, where? 
- Subject Line required for General. If not General, then MHV uses Subject + “inquiry.”
- Message detail and Reply: Switch order of "From" and "To"? (Not sure about this b/c "From" comes first in many UIs.)


## Reply to a message - x minutes 
- x

### Things to watch for:
- Message list: Is there a better place in the UX for the "you can reply to this message" swoosh that's now in the message list? Or should we mark the messages you *can't* reply to?  
- Compose and Reply: Should messages have a signature?
- Compose & Reply: Add text telling user it could take 3 days to get a reply.
- Form fields: Are there error scenarios we should test?
- Compose / Message preferences: Do Veterans want a signature field? 
- Compose and Reply: Work on attach message UX + design that alert.
- Multi screens: What do users mean by “provider”? An individual or a group?
- Compose: Would changing how the “To” field works confuse Veterans?  
- Compose and Reply: Can you edit the list of names under "To"? If so, where? 
- Reply: Figure out replying to the practice/team versus replying to an individual.
- Message detail & Reply: Where do you click to expand the message thread?
- Subject Line required for General. If not General, then MHV uses Subject + “inquiry.”
- Message detail and Reply: How many messages can be in the thread? 
- Message list: Is there a better place in the UX for the "you can reply to this message" swoosh that's now in the message list? Or should we mark the messages you *can't* reply to?  


## Other - x minutes
- x

### Things to watch for:
- 911 banner
- Folders: Should the character limit for custom folder names change? Consider all places the name shows, espec on mobile.
- Folders: Should we limit number of custom folders? Consider display of left nav on desktop and mobile. 
- General: Do we need a preferences page? Or would it just be a page to edit the list of names under "To"? 
- RE: Preferences: Notification options for Messages will be in VA.gov Profile. Do we need the signature settings (they contain COVID and flu text by default)? And based on our design direction, users don't control how many messages show in a list. 

## XXX - x minutes

- Do participants realize that this messaging on VA.gov is the same as MHV messaging?














## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes
- What are your thoughts about what we looked at today?
- Any other things that would be good for us to know?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
