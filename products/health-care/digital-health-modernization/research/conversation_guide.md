## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Megan and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to show you some ideas related to viewing and sending secure messages.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a Demo.** This is a demo and not a live website, parts may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Just let me know what you'd expect to happen in that case. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5-10 minutes
- Do you have health care through the VA?
- Do you have other benefits through the VA?
- Have you used My HealtheVet? If Yes, how often do you use it? What do you use it for? How do you access it (phone, tablet, laptop, etc)? What would you change about MHV?
- Do you use secure messaging now? What for? How often? What would you change about it?


## View messages - 5 minutes
- What are you seeing here?
- How many messages do you have?
- How many messages would you like to see at a time?

### Things to watch for:
- Do participants notice that the left nav are links and folders?
- Do participants see the action link "search"?
- Do participants see the < previous and next > navigation? 
- Do users want to sort, filter, or scan by attachment? 
- How and where should the Compose button be displayed?
- Do participants like the option of a more compressed inbox so more messages fit on a page? 


## Scroll and/or search messages - 5 - 10 minutes
- Let's say that you are looking for a message that your provider sent you a little while ago. It had test results in it that you would like to review.  How would you find that message?

- *If they scroll. . . 
- What are you looking for?
- How do you know which messages you have read and which messages you have not read?
- Are you seeing single messages or a series of messages sent back and forth, or both?
- Your doctor sent you a document with a copy of your test results. How would you find out which message contains this information?
- What name are you seeing on these messages?
- Would you ever want to change the order you see these messages in? What order would you like to see them in? How would you do that?
- Would you select one of these messages to read?

- *If they search. . . 
- What are you seeing here? 
- What would you enter here?
- What would you expect to see? (if they hit the search button here)
- Do you ever use advanced search?
- Which fields would you use?
- What do these fields mean to you?
- What order would you like them to be in?
- What would you expect to see? (if they hit the search button here)
- How would you get back to the first screen that we saw?


### Things to watch for:
- Do participants see the action link "search"?
- Do participants see the < previous and next > navigation? 
- Do users want to sort, filter, or scan by attachment? 
- Search questions here ->


## Send a new message - x minutes
- How long would you expect it would take to get a response to your message?

### Things to watch for:
- Compose and Reply: Should messages have a signature?
- Compose & Reply: Add text telling user it could take 3 days to get a reply.
- Form fields: Are there error scenarios we should test?
- Compose / Message preferences: Do Veterans want a signature field?
- Compose and Reply: Work on attach message UX + design that alert. 
- Multi screens: What do users mean by “provider”? An individual or a group?
- Compose: Would changing how the “To” field works confuse Veterans?  
- Multi screens: What do users mean by “provider”? An individual or a group?
- Compose and Reply: Can you edit the list of names under "To"? If so, where? 
- Subject Line required for General. If not General, then MHV uses Subject + “inquiry.”
- Message detail and Reply: Switch order of "From" and "To"? (Not sure about this b/c "From" comes first in many UIs.)


## Reply to a message - x minutes 
- How long would you expect it would take to get a response to your message?

### Things to watch for:
- Message list: Is there a better place in the UX for the "you can reply to this message" swoosh that's now in the message list? Or should we mark the messages you *can't* reply to?  
- Compose and Reply: Should messages have a signature?
- Compose & Reply: Add text telling user it could take 3 days to get a reply.
- Form fields: Are there error scenarios we should test?
- Compose / Message preferences: Do Veterans want a signature field? 
- Compose and Reply: Work on attach message UX + design that alert.
- Multi screens: What do users mean by “provider”? An individual or a group?
- Compose: Would changing how the “To” field works confuse Veterans?  
- Compose and Reply: Can you edit the list of names under "To"? If so, where? 
- Reply: Figure out replying to the practice/team versus replying to an individual.
- Message detail & Reply: Where do you click to expand the message thread?
- Subject Line required for General. If not General, then MHV uses Subject + “inquiry.”
- Message detail and Reply: How many messages can be in the thread? 
- Message list: Is there a better place in the UX for the "you can reply to this message" swoosh that's now in the message list? Or should we mark the messages you *can't* reply to?  


## Message Content - 5 minutes
- x

### Things to watch for:


## Last Questions - 5 minutes
- What would you do in the case of an emergency?

### Things to watch for:

- Folders: Should the character limit for custom folder names change? Consider all places the name shows, espec on mobile.
- Folders: Should we limit number of custom folders? Consider display of left nav on desktop and mobile. 
- General: Do we need a preferences page? Or would it just be a page to edit the list of names under "To"? 
- RE: Preferences: Notification options for Messages will be in VA.gov Profile. Do we need the signature settings (they contain COVID and flu text by default)? And based on our design direction, users don't control how many messages show in a list. 
- Do participants realize that this messaging on VA.gov is the same as MHV messaging?














## Post-Task Interview - 2 minutes
- What are your thoughts about what we looked at today?
- Any other things that would be good for us to know?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
