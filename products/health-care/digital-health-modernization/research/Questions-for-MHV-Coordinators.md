# Questions for MHV Coordinators
March 2022

# Goals
- Validate early assumptions that informed our Proof of Concept designs for MHV on VA.gov, learnings will inform later iterations of designs
- Establish relationship with MHV coordinators for future conversations to inform future topics such as communication strategies, outreach messaging, and training materials for coordinators once  

# Methods
- Speak with MHV UCD team to understand baseline info, determine what past research already exists, and reduce duplicative research asks
- Informal conversation with MHV coordinators to learn what they assist Veterans with the most when it comes to MHV
- Future: Have MHV coordinators help us pilot the MVP of MHV on VA.gov, shadow them as they assist Veterans using the MVP to access MHV or signup for healthcare benefits on MHV
