# Research Plan for MHV on VA.gov Usability Round 1
February - March, 2022

## Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information, what we've called our "Health Apartment". As part of this effort, MyHealtheVet (MHV) will be replatformed to VA.gov. We developed a prototype of what MHV on VA.gov could look like, which we are testing as part of this research. This study will build off of the results of our [informal user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-guerilla-test-12-2021/2021-12-guerilla-research-report.pdf), conducted in December 2021.

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following objectives:
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	
The goals of this study are to:
- determine if Veterans understand the concept of MHV on VA.gov as their "health apartment" 
- identify major usability or content issues with the current concept of MHV on VA.gov


### Outcome
Results of this study will help us determine if our proof of concept is headed in the right direction, and if there are any big usability concerns that Veterans experience with the designs. 

### Research questions
This research will help us answer:
- Will Veterans understand the concept of the health apartment? 
- How would Veterans expect to get to the health apartment?
- What would they expect to see in their health apartment if they were logged in? Not logged in?
- What are the most important things that folks access/need related to their health or their health benefits?
- What is the Veteran perception of how the health apartment would fit into how they manage their health at the VA?

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so donâ€™t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!


## Method	
We use conduct remote moderated usability studies using a high fidelity Sketch prototype. This round of research is focused on the laptop/desktop experience. Future rounds of research will explore mobile versions of the prototype.


### Location
This research will be remote via Zoom.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
The audience is Veterans with and without VA healthcare, to be recruited by Perigean. Participant criteria below were created using a lean but representative approach, see our [Recruitment Checker table](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/edit/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/Round1_Usability/Recruitment_checker.png). 


### Recruitment criteria
Please schedule a total of 15 Veterans for an expected completion rate of 10-12 studies. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- At least six participants that have VA healthcare and regularly use MyHealtheVet
- Up to six participants that do not use VA healthcare or access their health information via MyHealtheVet
- Must have access to a laptop or desktop computer to interact with the prototype. 

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
- 8 participants over the age of 55 years
- 4 participants from rural locations
- At least 2 women
- 4 participants without a college degree
- 8 participants with cognitive disabilities

## Timeline


### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.
