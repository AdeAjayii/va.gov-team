# Research Plan for the MyHealtheVet landing page, January 2022

## Goals


### Background
This study will build off of the results of our [informal user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-guerilla-test-12-2021/2021-12-guerilla-research-report.pdf), conducted in December 2021. 

### Research questions


### Hypotheses


## Method



## Location
We'll conduct user research remotely online using Zoom.

## Recruitment approach


## Recruitment criteria

### Total number of recruits
12 veterans

### Primary criteria
* Ideally get at least 4 participants who currently manage their healthcare through MHV
* Age: At least 4 people age 55+

### Secondary criteria
* Gender: At least 4 women
* Inclusion: 
  * At least 2 people of color
  * At least one person who identifies as LGBTQ+
* Geography: Participants from East Coast, West Coast, and the Midwest
* Disability: At least three participants who use DAT

**What we expect to learn:**
* Veterans who have "most common tasks" will show us whether those tasks are present and accessible on the new My HealtheVet landing page concept
* Some of the tasks we'll ask Veterans to find and initiatiate ([see conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-formal-research-12-2021/MyHealtheVet-authenticated-landing-page-Conversation-guide.md)) are pulled directly from our [IA Tree Test](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/IA-tree-test-11-2021/IA-tree-test-analysis.md), and had some of the lowest success rates from that test. This research should teach us whether the proposed homepage concept improves the success rate of those tasks.
