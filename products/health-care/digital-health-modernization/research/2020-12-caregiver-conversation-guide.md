# DRAFT Conversation Guide: Digital Health Modernization Discovery Research - Caregiver Group

**Session setup**

For this session, we may ask participants to share their screen in order to show us how they manage their health online. The moderator should also be prepared to share her screen and show an authenticated My HealtheVet account for reference and participant feedback.

## Introduction (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Emily and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experience with VA health care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

**This entire session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

**We want hear your personal experience and honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to know about it. Understanding your story will help us create better digital products for Veterans and caregivers like you, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express. 

**Health can be a personal topic.** I understand that there may be aspects about your health that you do not want to share with us. If you’d rather not answer a question, please just let me know and we can skip it. 

**If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** This is a voluntary session, and you will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

**During our session, I may ask if you can share your screen so I can see which online tools you use to manage your health care.** We will not be recording any audio or video today. 

## Background (5 minutes)

To get started, I’d like to get a little background information about you, and your experience with the VA.

6. Do you use any mobile apps to manage your or [Veteran's] health?

## Mental model of health at the VA (20 minutes)

- Any places where participants express confusion or frustration
- Any feedback that could make this process better

Now I’d like to hear about your experience first learning about VA benefits. **(10 minutes)**

6. In your mind, is there a relationship between "disability" and "health" when it comes to [Veteran's] VA benefits? 
7. When it comes to [your/Veteran's] health, what is the most important thing you need from the VA?

Now I’d like to ask you how you manage information and tasks related to [your/Veteran's] health. For each one, talk me through the steps you’d take. If there is something that you go online to complete, I may ask you to share your screen so I can see what you would do. **(10 minutes)**
