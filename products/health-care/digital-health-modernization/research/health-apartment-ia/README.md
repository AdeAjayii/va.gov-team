# Information Architecture Research for Health Apartment

Eventually, this file can serve as a landing page for multiple rounds of IA research that will help us validate the health apartment structure. For now, it's a place for Emily to leave some parting thoughts and share her thinking on next steps. Please deprecate those thoughts when it is no longer useful!

### Emily's thoughts
Before designing the proof of concept for the health apartment, we need to validate that it has a strong, scalable foundation. The two main needs that I see right now are to: 
1. validate the IA of the health apartment and discoverability of health things **within** the apartment, and
2. understand what needs to change with the overarching IA and navigation of VA.gov to support an easily discoveralble apartment. 

I suggest starting with #1, and iterating on the apartment IA until we get it right. Then move on to #2, which will inform subsequent conversations with Sitewide and other OCTO-DE crews about upcoming work. 

#### Tree testing the apartment interior
We've done some thinking to date about how best to validate the IA within the apartment. We landed on conducting a tree test to understand the discoverability of tasks and to validate the organization of information in the apartment. 

For this tree test, we need to be mindful of balancing thoroughness with an appropriate cognitive load for Veterans. With that in mind, we decided to test no more than 20 tasks per study. Here's how we prioritized which tasks we should test first. 
* We prioritized tasks/topics that we had questions about -- meaning things that didn't fit well in the existing MHV or VA.gov structure.
* We then cross-referenced top search terms with top tasks -- assuming that these are high-need, low-discoverability items.

Note: The "big 4" tools (messages, appointments, pharmacy, and records) are well-understood in MHV, and we did not make major shifts to their organization here. Thus, we're **not recommending that we test them as part of this first tree test.**

You can see a list of tasks beneath the [sitemap in this Mural.](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1630530056765/d3d8cdb3f341d709f2f6b6658bbd7d6b6c50bf75?sender=uaf2e527a10dad9fb94a02129) You will also find thoughts on how to segment the recruitment criteria so we are testing with an appropriate sample.
