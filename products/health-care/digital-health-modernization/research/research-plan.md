# Research Plan for Secure Messaging Usability Round 1
June 2022

## Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, MyHealtheVet (MHV), including Secure Messaging, will be replatformed to VA.gov. We developed a prototype of what Secure Messaging in MHV on VA.gov could look like on desktop and on a mobile device, which we are testing as part of this research.

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following objectives:
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	
The goals of this study are to:
- identify major usability or content issues with the current concept of secure messaging in MHV on VA.gov
- determine if Veterans understand that secure messaging is now part of MHV on VA.gov


### Outcome
Results of this study will help us determine if our proof of concept is headed in the right direction, and if there are any big usability concerns that Veterans experience with the designs. This will inform later iterations of the design.

### Research questions
This research will help us answer:

- Will Veterans understand that this messaging on VA.gov is the same as MHV messaging?
- corresponding with a person or a team
- How would Veterans expect to get to the health care information?
What would they expect to see in their My Health if they were logged in? Not logged in?
Will Veterans be able to accomplish the main health tasks related to appointments, secure messaging, pharmacy, and medical records with this design?
What is the Veteran perception of how the health apartment would fit into how they manage their health care at the VA?


### Hypothesis
- xx

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated usability studies using a high fidelity Sketch prototype. This round of research will test both the mobile user experience and the desktop user experience.


### Location
This research will be remote via Zoom.
