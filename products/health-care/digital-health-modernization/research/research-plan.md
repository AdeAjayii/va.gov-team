# Research Plan for Secure Messaging Usability Round 1
June 2022

## Background
Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Veterans to access their health information. As part of this effort, MyHealtheVet (MHV), including Secure Messaging, will be replatformed to VA.gov. We developed a prototype of what Secure Messaging in MHV on VA.gov could look like, which we are testing as part of this research.

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following objectives:
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging

## Research Goals	
The goals of this study are to:
- identify major usability or content issues with the current concept of secure messaging in MHV on VA.gov


### Outcome
Results of this study will help us determine if our proof of concept is headed in the right direction, and if there are any big usability concerns that Veterans experience with the designs. This will inform later iterations of the design.

### Research questions
This research will help us answer:
- Do participants notice that the left nav are links and folders?
- Do participants like the option of a more compressed inbox so more messages fit on a page?
- Do participants see the action links (compose and search?
- Do participants realize that this messaging on VA.gov is the same as MHV messaging?
- Folders: Should the character limit for custom folder names change? Consider all places the name shows, espec on mobile.
- Message list: Is there a better place in the UX for the "you can reply to this message" swoosh that's now in the message list? Or should we mark the messages you *can't* reply to?  
- Compose and Reply: Should messages have a signature?
- Compose & Reply: Add text telling user it could take 3 days to get a reply.
- Message detail and Reply: Switch order of "From" and "To"? (Not sure about this b/c "From" comes first in many UIs.)
- Reply: Figure out replying to the practice/team versus replying to an individual.
- Message detail & Reply: Where do you click to expand the message thread?
- Messages landing/Inbox: How does a draft message look?
- Compose and Reply: Can you edit the list of names under "To"? If so, where? 
- General: Do we need a preferences page? Or would it just be a page to edit the list of names under "To"? 
- RE: Preferences: Notification options for Messages will be in VA.gov Profile. Do we need the signature settings (they contain COVID and flu text by default)? And based on our design direction, users don't control how many messages show in a list. 
- Folders: Should we limit number of custom folders? Consider display of left nav on desktop and mobile. 
- Subject Line required for General. If not General, then MHV uses Subject + “inquiry.”
- Multi screens: How and where should the Compose button be displayed?
- Message detail and Reply: How many messages can be in the thread? 
- Compose and Reply: Work on attach message UX + design that alert.
- 911 alert
- Left nav: What should we call the Deleted folder? 
- Compose: Would changing how the “To” field works confuse Veterans?

### Hypothesis
- Veterans 

## Method	
We use conduct remote moderated usability studies using a high fidelity Sketch prototype. This round of research is focused on the laptop/desktop experience (check this). Future rounds of research will explore mobile versions of the prototype.


### Location
This research will be remote via Zoom. 

### Research materials 
- [Conversation guide]()
- [Prototype]()
