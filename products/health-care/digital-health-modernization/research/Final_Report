# Research Goals

Our project is part of the Digital Health Modernization strategy, which aims to create a centralized place for Participants to access their health information. As part of this effort, MyHealtheVet (MHV) will be replatformed to VA.gov. We developed a prototype of what MHV on VA.gov could look like on mobile devices, which we are testing as part of this research. This study will build off of the results of our [informal user testing](https://github.com/department-of-Participants-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-guerilla-test-12-2021/2021-12-guerilla-research-report.pdf), conducted in December 2021 and our [Round 1 testing with a desktop prototype]( ), conducted in March 2022. 

The goals of this study are to:
- Determine if participants understand the concept of MHV on VA.gov as a centralized place to access healthcare
- Identify major usability or content issues with our current concept of replatforming MHV on VA.gov 
- Evaluate if participants are able to use the current prototype on a mobile device (currently 50% of users access MHV from a mobile device)

### OCTO Objectives 

This work supports the following objectives:
- Participants can manage their health services online
- Participants and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

### Participant Journey

This research fits into these points of a Participant's Journey:
- Starting up
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring
- Aging


# Research Questions

This research will help us answer:
- Will participants understand the concept of a centralized place for their healthcare as shown in this design? 
- How would Participants expect to get to the healthcare information?
- What would they expect to see in their My Health landing page if they were logged in? Not logged in?
- Will participants be able to accomplish the main health tasks related to appointments, secure messaging, pharmacy, and medical records with this design?
- What is the participant perception of how the health apartment would fit into how they manage their health at the VA?
- Can participants smoothly use the proposed navigation for MHV on a mobile device?


# Methodology 

We conducted eleven remote hour-long moderated usability studies using a high fidelity Sketch prototype. This round of research focused on the mobile experience. 


# Hypotheses and Conclusions

- Participants will easily understand the idea of a centralized place where they can access their VA healthcare information.
	- *Definitely True*. Participants easily understood our prototype to be a centralized place to access their healthcare information, and even their other non-healthcare benefits.
- Participants will expect a personalized experience if logged in, such as their specific prescriptions, appointments, or information relevant to their care.
	-  *Definitely True*. Participants expected to see their personal data populate if logged in.
- Participants will be able to accomplish a variety of health tasks as designed in this prototype.
	- *Likely True*. Participants were able to complete the majority of our tasks successfully, but we did identify some areas for improvement with specific tasks and concepts. 
- Participants will be able to smoothly use the proposed navigation for MHV on a mobile device.
	-  *Mostly True*. Participants navigated successfully through the higher levels of the IA but struggled with navigating within specific pages.


# Key Findings

1. Users were able to successfully complete many basic health-related tasks.

2. Most users (10/11) logged in using the embedded sign in/create an account button.

3. Most users (6/7) were able to successfully navigate from the main page to sub-pages and back; however, they struggled with finding sub-navigation within pages.

4. Users were confused about certain terms including "Pending" and "Blue Button".

5. Users did not find the "Pre-check in" link in the "In This Section" menu.


# Details of Findings 

**1. Users were able to successfully complete many basic health-related tasks.** 

Labels: 

The health-related tasks that users were able to complete included refilling their medications and sending their providers a message.  They were also able to view their medicial records, including labs and x-rays. Finally they were able to make an appointment and view details about an existing appointment.

> This is fewer steps and also less time trying to find the Rx I want. It would be really nice to refill all eligible. It's way easier to remember one click over four clicks; a blind person tries to memorize the steps.(P8, Participant, when he noticed the "Refill all eligible perscriptions" link)


**2. Most users (10/11) logged in using the embedded sign in/create an account button.**

Labels: 

Need content here ->

> It would give me a total sign in. It would sign me in to all of this. (P2, Participant, noticing that signing in would give him access to information in a single place that is currently on multiple sites)


**3. Most users (6/7) were able to successfully navigate from the main page to sub-pages and back; however, they struggled with finding sub-navigation within pages.**

Labels: 

9 users interacted with the sub-navigation which was a drop down labeled "In This Section" and they interacted with it in a variety of ways. (Users may have interacted with the menu in multiple ways.)
- 5 of the 9 users interacted with the subnavigation when asked where they would go if they had questions about the content of the page. There are "FAQ" and "How to" links in the menu.
- 3 of the 9 users tried to sort their messages in the "In This Section" navigation which is not possible.
- 1 of the 9 users tried to use it to navigate to the home page which is not possible.
- 4 of the 9 users interacted with the menu after prompting for the moderator (ie. Do you see a way that you can do that on this page?)

> If you had a question about your messages- well . . . I don't know, maybe I'd just have to see if there's a FAQ or something or option to click for help in "Message menu". (P1, participant)


**4. Users were confused about certain terms including "Pending" and "Blue Button".
Labels:

50% of participants had heard of Blue Button and understand what it did or had used it before.  None of the participants knew that Pending appointments had not yet been confirmed by the VA.


**5. Users did not find the "Pre-check in" link in the "In This Section" menu.

Labels:

None of the participants expected to find

# Next Steps

Our next steps are to bring these findings to our design team and iterate on our prototype. We will incorporate these recommendations into our next round of usability testing, which is focused on testing a mobile version of these designs.

## Who we talked to 

**Recruitment criteria**
Our primary criteria was participants who do and do not have VA Healthcare, and who do and do not use MHV on their smartphone. We used a lean but representative approach for most criteria, but overrepresented participants with cognitive disabilities. Our goal was to ensure our designs worked with the participants most likely to have a difficult time interacting with a complex website. Our previous round had included fewer women than we had hoped so we overrepresented women in this round.  We also included a significant number of smart phone users as they would be most likely to use the website on their smart phones once it is released.

We talked to **eleven participants**.
