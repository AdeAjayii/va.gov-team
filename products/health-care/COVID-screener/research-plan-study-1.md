# Research Plan for COVID screener, May 2020

## Goals	
This study is to support the implementation of the COVID screener tool created by the Raleigh/Durham VAMC. 

The screener allows the VAMC operations staff to quickly, remotely screen everyone entering the medical center for COVID symptoms. It was created to reduce in-person interaction with staff and triage potential COVID patients away from the general hospital population. The product was launched around May 8, 2020.

Our primary research questions are: 
- What are users' (Veterans, employees, and visitors) expectations for screening/intake at the VAMC?
- Can users effectively find and complete the screener?
- Do users know what to do after completing the screener? Are their expectations met?
- Does the screener accomplish the goals of the VAMC staff? (These will be more clearly defined before the study runs).

Hypothesis:

The screener tool will allow users to quickly self-triage and get a PASS/SCREEN result, however the usefulness of this result will be unclear.


## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning?

Directed interviews combined with usability testing of a high-fidelity prototype. Remote moderated.
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

Selected this method to gather information around the users expectations for COVID, intake processes. Have a live product to do usability testing on. Remote for safety.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*

Preference to use ZoomGov account, will consider others if they allow for mobile testing.

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 

TBD. Currently the prototype solution is available online, we may have a 2.0 version or high-fidelity mocks prior to this study running.

## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	
Targeting 8 users including a mix of Veterans, non-Veteran visitors, and VA medical center employees. All must have recently visited a VAMC (within 6 months). Strong preference for Raleigh/Durham VAMC staff. Strong preference for Veterans/Visitors to Raleigh Durham within the past week.

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
Research recruiting contract.

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 	
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
