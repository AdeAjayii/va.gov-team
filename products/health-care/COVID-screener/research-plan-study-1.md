# Research Plan for COVID screener, May 2020

## Goals	
Support the implementation of the COVID screener tool created by the Raleigh/Durham VAMC. 

The screener allows the VAMC operations staff to quickly, remotely screen everyone entering the medical center for COVID symptoms. It was created to reduce in-person interaction with staff and triage potential COVID patients away from the general hospital population. The product was launched around May 8, 2020.

Our primary research questions are: 
- What are users' (Veterans, employees, and visitors) expectations for screening/intake at the VAMC?
- Can users effectively find and complete the screener?
- Do users know what to do after completing the screener? Are their expectations met?
- Does the screener accomplish the goals of the VAMC staff? (These will be more clearly defined before the study runs).

Hypothesis:

TBD


## Method	
Directed interviews combined with usability testing of a high-fidelity prototype. Remotely moderated. Mobile devices only.
  	
We will use the interview questions to gather contextual information around the users expectations for a visit to VAMC during COVID and the intake processes, questions will be tailored to the users profile (Veteran, staff, etc) and whether they have visited since COVID precautions started. We also have a live version of the product to do usability testing.

Currently the prototype solution is available online, we may have a 2.0 version or high-fidelity mocks prior to this study running.

Preference for now is to use a ZoomGov account but will consider any option that will allow a user to remotely share their mobile screen.

## Participants and Recruitment	
Targeting 8 users including a mix of Veterans, non-Veteran visitors, and VA medical center employees. All must have recently visited a VAMC (within 6 months). Strong preference for Raleigh/Durham VAMC staff. Strong preference for Veterans/Visitors to Raleigh Durham within the past week.

Research recruiting contract required to supply participants.
