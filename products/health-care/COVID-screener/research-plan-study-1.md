# Research Plan for COVID screener, May 2020

## Goals	
Provide the first round of Veteran feedback on the new screener tool based on the product build by the Raleigh/Durham VAMC. 

The screener allows the Veterans to quickly and remotely self-screen for COVID symptoms prior to entering a VA medical center. The first version was created to reduce in-person interaction with staff and triage potential COVID patients away from the general hospital population in Raleigh/Durham VAMC. The product was launched around May 8, 2020.

Our primary research questions are: 
- What are users' (Veterans, employees, and visitors) expectations for screening/intake at the VAMC?
- Can users effectively find and complete the screener?
- Do users know what to do after completing the screener? Are their expectations met?
- Does the screener accomplish the goals of the VAMC staff? (These will be more clearly defined before the study runs).

Hypothesis:

We have built a fast, easily understood screening tool that Veterans can find and complete quickly.


## Method	
Directed interviews combined with usability testing of a high-fidelity prototype. Remotely moderated. Mobile devices only.
  	
We will use the interview questions to gather contextual information around the users expectations for a visit to VAMC during COVID and the intake processes, questions will be tailored to the users profile (Veteran, staff, etc) and whether they have visited since COVID precautions started. We also have a live version of the product to do usability testing.

Currently the prototype solution is available online, we may have a 2.0 version or high-fidelity mocks prior to this study running.

Preference for now is to use a ZoomGov account but will consider any option that will allow a user to remotely share their mobile screen.

## Participants and Recruitment	
Targeting 5 users including a mix of Veterans, non-Veteran visitors, and VA medical center employees. All must have recently visited a VAMC (within 6 months). Strong preference for anyone who has visited a VAMC in the last month.

Research recruiting contract required to supply participants.
