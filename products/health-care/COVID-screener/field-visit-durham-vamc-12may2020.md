# Durham VAMC field visit

### Tuesday May 12 @ 7:00 am

Today was the 2nd day of ScreenPass operations at Durham VAMC.
- I was stationed at the halfway point in the breezeway which is primarily an employee entrance in the morning rush hour.
- There were two screeners handing out the green dots in the breezeway. 
- One screener was helping organize folks and repeatedly reminding them to use the app if they had it downloaded.
- Screener1 was telling folks to show their phones to Screener2, along with their employee ID, so they could get the green dot for the day. 

## Employee arrival and app usage from 7-8 am

- Total number of employees passing by my observation point: ~400
- 1 patient and 1 visitor passed by during the hour of observation (they did not attempt to use the app)

| Status        | Number of users  |
| ------------- | -----:|
| Did not use app | 298 |
| Successful with app | 81 |
| Successful with app with additional help     | 15 |
| App did not work for them | 6 |

No (0) employees recorded a RED screen this morning. 

Everyone who used the app succesfully got a GREEN pass screen.

## Observations and heuristics

### App needs to be optimized for users on the go
- Employees have their arms full with purses, coffee, lunch boxes, gym bags, etc. 
- Folks often are balancing all their stuff, walking quickly into work, and trying to use the app with one hand
- Target size needs to be larger since folks have their hands full and are walking

### Folks who had technical problems generally had older phones
- For folks with newer phones, they simply take a photo of the QR code poster and there is a popup to launch the web page and answer the questions. 
- Older phones simply take a photo and then nothing happens
- Some folks don't have a QR Code reader app installed
- Some users have to click Finish multiple times to get the app to proceed to the green screen

### Quotes from folks who didn't use the app

- "I've never done one of those [QR code] and I don't plan on starting today."
- "I'm too lazy to pull out my phone."

### Quotes from folks who did use the app successfully

- "I like it."
- "This is cool."
- "See how easy that is."
- "I love it."
- "We like it, we'll try it tonight." (these were 3 employees leaving work)

### Feedback from screeners at the entrance of the hospital

 - Diretions are not clear, some folks don't know if they need the QR Code app or not
 - Finish button is not always functional, some folks need to click it two or three times
 - Employees may get the dot in the breezeway but they they need to show it again at the door, sometimes they forget and get confused as to what they need to do
 
 ## Overall observations
 
 - For the second day of operations, things went quite smoothly. Many folks used the app on their own and had a green success screen to show the screener. 
 - As I was leaving, I saw 3 employees using the poster themselves. 
 - Screener1 was doing a great job of reminding folks to use the app. I think now that this is a regular thing, employees will get used to using it every morning as they walk into work. 
 - Folks have their hands full and the app needs bigger target sizes. 
 - Folks who used the app succesfully really liked it, they have been answering in-person for a while now and this is much faster.
- If this will rollout to patients, the QR Code part should be redesigned. New phones have no problem but older phones do not successfully launch the web page to answer the questions.
