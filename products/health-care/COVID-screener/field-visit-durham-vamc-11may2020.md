# Durham VAMC field visit
## Monday May 11 @ 10:00

### Main entrance

- I met Stacy the VA screener
- Blue sticker today - the sticker color changes every day
- One person lost their sticker and had to be resasked
- Stacy used the app herself today and like it

### Patient in-person questioning persisted at the main entrance today. No RED patients in my 20 minutes of observation. 
- This morning everyone was asked the questions in person. 
- No one used the app at this entrance. 
- The app is mostly for employees who were getting annoyed having to stand in line and get asked the questions every day.

- 10:17 employees getting an ID card asked in person

Talked to an employee who saved the url icon on her android phone desktop she loves the app

Kimra is having large banners printed because the posters are too small to notic in the breezeway entrance

#### QR code reader didn't work on a Google pixel phone
- QR code wasn’t reading for an employee (Google pixel phones). 
- Somehow the QR code had her download Square and didn’t work.
- She got a coworker to text her the URL and she bookmarked it.

#### I went to at the end of breezeway entrance. 
- 3 screeners at a table. 
- Goal is to have 2-6 screeners at each of 3 entrances at all times. 
- If a patient is RED, the screener will accompany them to the covid testing area.
- Do not want to let RED patients in the door.

#### Then I spoke to a screener in the mid-breezeway location (didn't get her name).

- Answers changing as you wait
- Getting people coming in who’s appts are canceled and they didn’t know they’re mad
- This is all a mess
- Some will be honest
- Understand the benefit of behind honest
- Some just say they’re ok then their story changes

### Waiting area issues

- Need to figure how to queue people bc they can’t be in the waiting room
- Only small areas for people to come in red green arrows on the breezeway and chairs can’t get through
- Don’t want patients waiting in the hallways or other areas
- People wait in their car and then get called in
- If this many chairs in the waiting rooms so lots of people can’t hang around
- Too many signs at the moment

### Plan for tomorrow

I will go back early (around 7:00) in the breezeway entrance so I can observe the employees arriving and using the app. 

I'd like to gather the task success measurements that Jeff discussed:
1. Successful with no help
2. Successful but needed help
3. Could not or did not use the app

Also gather metrics on numbers of people and how many are employees, patients, and visitors.
