# VEText patient tracking 
**A text-based feature to help protect Veterans, caregivers, and employees at VA health facilities**

## THE PROBLEM
To protect Veterans, caregivers, and VA employees during the coronavirus pandemic, VA facilities must follow CDC guidance on physical distancing for in-person appointments. But many clinics have small waiting rooms that don’t allow for proper distancing.

## THE SOLUTION
A new VEText feature allows VA facilities to check patients in remotely while ensuring physical distancing. Providing simple, easy-to-use digital tools like this one helps reduce wait times, ease stress, and lower exposure risk. It also helps Veterans gain confidence in the new reality of increased digital interactions as part of their VA health care experience.

## TOOL FEATURES

VA designed this tool in partnership with Veterans and medical center leadership, incorporating feedback from user testing to ensure the tool meets Veteran and employee needs.

**Text appointment confirmation and reminder**
The Veteran receives a text confirmation as soon as they make their appointment. They receive another text reminder 24 hours before their appointment. This text provides instructions on where to park and how to check in.

**Remote check-in**
The Veteran sends a text when they arrive at the facility. They receive an automated response confirming their appointment time, with a phone number to call if they have questions or need assistance.

**Remote patient tracking**
Facility staff use the VEText portal to track patient appointment status. Clear, color-coded statuses make tracking easy. Staff then text the Veteran when it’s time to come in for their appointment.

**Pre-registration by phone**
Facility staff may opt to call the Veteran to get their updated demographic and insurance information while they wait outside.
