# Questions for site visit 5/11

We should measure how many
- pass - get the QR code and complete the screener without assistance
- pass with assistance - need assistance and are ultimately succcessful
- fail - cant get it to work, go inside for screening

Other things to track
- percent of Veterans vs Guests vs Employees
- QR code app already on phone vs need to download


Great ideas we are tracking
- can we get a text number and then send them the url?
- can we get them to fill out this screener at home and print it out?
