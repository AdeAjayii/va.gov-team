# Intro screen

**ScreenPass**

_[initial recommended content; would love to include # of questions in the intro messaging if possible...will all users get all 5 questions?]_

Each time you enter a VA facility, you'll need to answer 6 questions first as part of our coronavirus symptom screening. 

We won't store or share any of your data.

[button] Start


# Question 1

**Question 1 of 6** _[Can we include the "of [total #]" to keep progress signal throughout screening? Will update content thoughts in alignment with revised design approach to making employee option more of an opt-out]_

Are you a:

[button] Patient

[button] Visitor

[button] Employee or contractor


# Question 2

**Question 2 of 6**

Have you had a fever in the last 24 hours?

[button] Yes

[button] No

_[potential alt to keep the timing up front for consistency with other questions and to use the correct word of "past" rather than "last"]

In the past 24 hours, have you had a fever?

# Question 3

**Question 3 of 6**

In the last week, have you had a NEW or WORSENING cough or shortness of breath?

_[potential alt that's more plain language and avoids all caps while still emphasizing the new/worsening by putting them at the end of the question and to use "past" instead of "last"]_ 

In the past week, have you had a cough or shortness of breath that's new or getting worse?

[button] Yes

[button] No

# Question 4

**Question 4 of 6**

In the last 3 days, have you had flu-like symptoms?

_[potential alt to use "past" instead of "last" and potential additional help content that lists flu-like symptoms from CDC for clarity]_

In the past 3 days, have you had flu-like symptoms?

These may include:
- Fever or feeling feverish/chills
- Cough
- Sore throat
- Runny or stuffy nose
- Muscle or body aches
- Headaches
- Fatigue (tiredness)
- Vomiting or diarrhea (less common in adults)

# Question 5

**Question 5 of 6**

Have you been exposed to someone CONFIRMED with Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease WITHOUT wearing personal protective equipment (PPE)?

_[potential alt for plain language, style guide, and avoiding all caps; also, do we want to include a timeframe here? If they'd been exposed >2 weeks ago, do they still need additional screening?]_

In the past 2 weeks, have you been exposed to someone who has a confirmed coronavirus diagnosis when you weren't wearing personal protective equipment (PPE)?

# Question 6

**Question 6 of 6**

Do you currently have nasal congestion, sore throat, or runny nose?

_[potential alt for grammar so we can add an "a" before "sore throat, runny nose"]_

Do you currently have a sore throat, runny nose, or nasal congestion?

_[Questions for this screen]_

1) I wonder a bit about "Pass/Fail" kind of language from an empathy standpoint, as well as whether it risks putting the user in the mind frame of this being a test they should try to pass (especially if they're taking it multiple days). Wondering if we can use just color to indicate 
 
2) What happens if the user clicks, "Restart"? Does it let the user take the screener again? Wondering if we should put a note on there about not taking the screener more than once per day?
