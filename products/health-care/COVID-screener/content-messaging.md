# Intro screen

**COVID-19 screener**

_[initial recommended content; would love to include # of questions in the intro messaging if possible...will all users get all 6 questions?]_

Each time you enter a VA facility, you'll need to answer 6 questions first as part of our coronavirus symptom screening. 

We won't store or share any of your data.

[button] Start


# Question 1

**Question 1 of 6** _[Can we include the "of [total #]" to keep progress signal throughout screening? Will update content thoughts in alignment with revised design approach to making employee option more of an opt-out]_

Are you a:

[button] Patient

[button] Visitor

[button] Employee or contractor


# Question 2

**Question 2 of 6**

Have you had a fever in the last 24 hours?

[button] Yes

[button] No

_[potential alt to keep the timing up front for consistency with other questions and to use the correct word of "past" rather than "last"]_

In the past 24 hours, have you had a fever?

# Question 3

**Question 3 of 6**

In the last week, have you had a NEW or WORSENING cough or shortness of breath?

_[potential alt that's more plain language and avoids all caps while still emphasizing the new/worsening by putting them at the end of the question and to use "past" instead of "last"]_ 

In the past week, have you had a cough or shortness of breath that's new or getting worse?

[button] Yes

[button] No

# Question 4

**Question 4 of 6**

In the last 3 days, have you had flu-like symptoms?

_[potential alt to use "past" instead of "last" and potential additional help content that lists flu-like symptoms from CDC for clarity]_

In the past 3 days, have you had flu-like symptoms?

These may include symptoms like a fever, chills, sore throat, headache, body aches, or fatigue (tiredness).

# Question 5

**Question 5 of 6**

Have you been exposed to someone CONFIRMED with Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease WITHOUT wearing personal protective equipment (PPE)?

_[potential alt for plain language, style guide, and avoiding all caps; also, do we want to include a timeframe here? If they'd been exposed >2 weeks ago, do they still need additional screening?]_

In the past 14 days, have you been exposed to someone with a confirmed coronavirus diagnosis without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE)?

# Question 6

**Question 6 of 6**

Do you currently have nasal congestion, sore throat, or runny nose?

_[potential alt for grammar so we can add an "a" before "sore throat, runny nose"]_

Do you currently have a sore throat, runny nose, or nasal congestion?
