# Durham VAMC field visit
### Saturday May 9 @ 1:00

## This is the current screening process:

1. Patient is dropped off at main entrance or they park their car and walk up. No family members or anyone can accompany them.
2. All the patients I observed (~6) already had masks before walking up or getting out of their cars.
3. The nurse/greeter greets the patient and makes sure they have their phones with them since that’s the only way their family member will be able to reach them.
4. The patient goes through the doors to talk to the desk to talk to a nurse/screener and answer the covid questions.
5. If they fail the screen (i.e., they have any symptoms) they are sent back outside the hospital main doors to the adjacent area to the “covid nurse” for testing (I didn’t see this).
6. If they pass the screen, they get a bright yellow dot sticker on their chest and they can move into the hospital to their regularly scheduled appointment.

## The new ScreenPass starts on Monday. This is how it’s planned to work:
- I met Kim, a pulmonology specialist who has been serving as a greeter/patient screener for a little while now. She had her phone set up the other day, someone helped her install the QR Code reader.
- The patients will have to install the QR Code app from their cars, then start it and point at the sign with the QR code.
The QR code points to the URL of the ScreenPass web page.
- The patient will then have to answer the questions and get the red/green validation.
- If red, then the patient cannot go into the main hospital doors. Patient will be directed to the “covid nurse” adjacent area per the current process.
- If green patient shows the nurse at the door and they get the bright yellow dot sticker to put on their chest and continue on to their appointment inside.
- Kim is concerned that the older/ill vets will have a hard time installing this app from their cars. So then the nurses/greeters will have to do tech support to help the patients? She’s not sure how this part will go.
- It’s really hard to see the phone screen on a bright day in Durham, finding and installing a QR Code reading app will not be easy. Same goes for viewing the ScreenPass web page.

Kim and I exchanged contact info, I’m going to go back on Monday morning around 10 to see how the new process is going. I wasn’t able to see the new signs but they’ll be there Monday.

Any other questions/observations you’d like to know, please let me know.
