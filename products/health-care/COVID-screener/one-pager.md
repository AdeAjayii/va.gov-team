**A digital tool to help protect patients and employees at VA health facilities**

## THE PROBLEM

To protect patients and staff, VA must now screen everyone for coronavirus symptoms and exposure each time they enter a health facility. In-person screening can delay care and increase exposure risk. It can also be stressful for some people.

## THE SOLUTION

A digital pre-entry screening tool allows people to answer questions before coming to VA, and share their results when they arrive. Staff members can then quickly triage people to either enter the building or get more screening.

Providing simple, easy-to-use digital tools like this one helps reduce wait times, ease stress, and lower exposure risk. It also helps Veterans gain confidence in the new reality of increased digital interactions as part of their VA health care experience.

## TOOL FEATURES

In partnership with Veterans and VA medical centers, we designed a digital tool that allows users to quickly and easily answer pre-entry screening questions on their mobile phone. We built, tested, launched, and refined this tool based on Veteran feedback in less than 10 days.

**Simple experience** <br>
Users can access the tool quickly via text. Large text and buttons, plain language, and a simple flow of 5 questions allow users to complete screening in under a minute.

**Clear results** <br>
The results screen shows 1 of 2 messages ("OK to proceed" or "More screening needed") plus a timestamp and next steps. The large, clear text and color-coded screens help staff easily triage.

**Quick access to crisis support** <br>
For Veterans in need of immediate support, the tool provides quick access to the Veterans Crisis Line.

**Easy-to-update screening protocols** <br>
The tool's features allow us to update questions within 24 hours to meet evolving needs.

**How we're collaborating across the enterprise to create a better Veteran and employee experience**

True to VA's innovative nature, medical centers across the country responded to the need to digitize screening by quickly building facility-specific tools. Our DEPO team worked closely with the Durham VA Health Care System to learn from their efforts and create a scalable tool that all VA facilities can easily use. We also worked with other VA leaders and Veterans.
