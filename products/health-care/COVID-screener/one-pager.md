**A mobile pre-entry screening tool to help protect patients and employees at VA health facilities**

## THE PROBLEM

As the country begins to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic, VA faces a new reality of needing to individually screen an increasing number of patients, employees, and others for COVID-19 symptoms and exposure risk each time they enter a health facility. Having employees or volunteers conduct the full screening in person delays care and increases frustration and exposure risk for patients and staff.

## THE SOLUTION

A mobile-friendly pre-entry screening tool allows patients, employees, and others to answer questions about symptoms and exposure before coming to a VA health facility, and show their results at the facility's entrance. Depending on the user's results, they're directed to either proceed into the building or go to a designated area for more screening.

In this time of needing to limit face-to-face interactions as much as possible, providing simple, easy-to-use digital tools like this one helps to reduce wait times, ease frustrations, and lower exposure risk for all. It also helps Veterans and their families become more comfortable with increased digital interactions as part of their VA health care experience.

## SCREENER FEATURES

In partnership with Veterans and VA medical centers, we rapidly researched, designed, and built a digital tool that allows users to quickly and easily answer COVID-19 pre-screening questions from home, their car, or outside the VA facility.

**Simple questions and interaction**
The tool presents a simple flow of 6 questions about COVID-19 symptoms and exposure. Large text and buttons, along with a simple interaction design, make the experience easy to navigate from a mobile phone.

**Clear results**
The user receives either a blue **PASS** screen or a gray **More screening needed** results screen with a timestamp and directions on next steps. The clear messaging and color-coded screens help employees easily triage those who need more screening.

**Access to the Veterans Crisis Line**
For Veterans in need of immediate mental health support, the tool prominently displays a clickable link to the Veterans Crisis Line. The text that users receive to access the screening tool also includes easy access to the crisis line.

**Easy-to-update screening protocols**
The tool's features allow us to update questions within 24 hours to meet the evolving needs for screening.

# VHA local and national offices + VA OIT Digital Experience Product Office
**How we're collaborating across the enterprise to create a better Veteran and employee experience**

True to the innovative nature of our VA leaders and employees, individual medical centers across the country responded to the need to digitize screening by quickly building facility-specific tools. Our OIT DEPO team worked closely with the Durham VA Health Care System to learn and build from the tool they'd built for their facility and create a scalable tool that all VA facilities can easily implement. We also worked with other VA medical centers, digital leaders, and Veterans in building the tool.
