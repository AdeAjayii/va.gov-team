**A digital tool to help protect patients and employees at VA health facilities**

## THE PROBLEM

To protect patients and staff, VA must now screen everyone for coronavirus symptoms and exposure each time they enter a health facility. In-person screening can delay care and increase exposure risk. It can also be stressful for some people.

## THE SOLUTION

A digital pre-entry screening tool allows Veterans, caregivers, and employees to answer questions on their mobile phones and share their results at the VA facility entrance. Staff members can then quickly triage Veterans, caregivers, and employees to either enter the building or go to a designated area for more screening.

Providing simple, easy-to-use digital tools like this one helps reduce wait times, ease stress, and lower exposure risk. It also helps Veterans gain confidence in the new reality of increased digital interactions as part of their VA health care experience.

## TOOL FEATURES

In partnership with Veterans, VA designed and built, tested, and refined this tool based on Veteran feedback in less than 10 days.

**Simple experience** <br>
Users can access the tool quickly via text message. Large text and buttons, plain language, and a simple flow of 5 questions allow users to complete screening in under a minute.

**Clear results** <br>
The results screen shows 1 of 2 messages ("OK to proceed" or "More screening needed") plus a timestamp and next steps. The large, clear text and color-coded screens help staff easily triage.

For Veterans in need of immediate support, the tool provides quick access to the Veterans Crisis Line.

**Easy-to-update screening protocols** <br>
The tool's features allow us to update questions within 24 hours to meet evolving needs.
