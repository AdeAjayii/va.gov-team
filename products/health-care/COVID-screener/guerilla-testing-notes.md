# Guerilla Testing Notes


Veterans
- When was your last visit to a VA medical Center?
- What was the screening/check-in experience like?

Non-Veterans
- Have you recently visited the doctor or a hospital?
- Did they ask you any questions about COVID?


## P1  - Female, late 50s, Non-Vet
- Needed to install the Zoom app to launch the meeting (may be a feature of the ZoomGov account)
- button in bottom center says share content, select screen, select Zoom only, Allow (if prompted), Start Broadcast.

Walking through the screener, "fill this out as if you were a guest arriving at the medical center"
- attention immidieately to the VCL banner
- quickly navigating through the questions, selecting no to all
- reading out the Question 1 of 6 each screen
- Pass - 
-- "ok i got the green light"
-- "this is my pass, it says start a new screerning, since I pass I dont need to."
-- "I like how big the text is"
-- "I think its very clear, yes or no questions, simple to understand"
- Any difficulty? none
- What would you expect to happen next?
-- "I would leave it on this screen/page to show somebodoy
-- "What I think happens next is i go to show somebody this"
-- "What would a new screening be? Is that something else or starting over?
- Other Questions?
-- "What if someone thinks of something? There's no back button."
-- "Dont want people to think oh I passed, I want to get screened maybe I should take it again"
- We are concered about the navigation, was the app easy to use?
-- Just used my thumb one hand (button size was fine)

## P2 - Male, early 20s, Non-Vet
- No problem accessing

- Walking through the screener, "fill this out as if you were a guest arriving at the medical center"
-- reading prompt on homepage
-- "I havent taken my temperature, but didnt notice that I had a problem."
--"Shoot, how did I answer that one, how do I go back?"
-- used the browswer back button (bottom left on Chrome) to get back to the last question

- What would you expect to happen next? PASS
  -- "Show this to a person to show them that i passed, right, then they would let me in?"

Anything you liked or didnt like about the app?
- "Maybe a tap to highlight and tap to confirm"
- "I accidently hit an answer at one point when i was trying to scroll and read"
- "Or mabe like a radio button with a next button at the bottom"
- "It looks like the page requires you to scroll"
- "Seems pretty clear to me"
- Assumed that start a new screening would start over

Walk through the FAIL scenario
- "I figure if someone doesnt pass the pre-screening it would be easy for them to go back and retake the survey and get a pass,
it doesnt have a self-certification"
- "Maybe something that would lock in your answer if you get yes (FAIL) on this screen"

What would you expect to happen next? FAIL
"I would show it to someone and they would give me a mask and gloves and take my temperature."

Any other feedback?
"Seems pretty solid"

How were you holding your phone and using the app?
"I was using one hand (to both hold the phone and use thumb to select) and thats how I accidently hit the wrong button when I tried to scroll."
