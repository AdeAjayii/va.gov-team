# Guerilla Testing Notes


Veterans
- When was your last visit to a VA medical Center?
- What was the screening/check-in experience like?

Non-Veterans
- Have you recently visited the doctor or a hospital?
- Did they ask you any questions about COVID?


## P1 
- Needed to install the Zoom app to launch the meeting (may be a feature of the ZoomGov account)
- button in bottom center says share content, select screen, select Zoom only, Allow (if prompted), Start Broadcast.

attention immidieately to the VCL banenr
easily navigating through the questions
Pass - "ok i got the green light"
"this is my pass, it says start a new screerning, since I pass I dont need to."
I like how big the text is
I think its very clear, yes or no questions, simple to understand
difficulty? none
what happens next
i would leave it on this screen/page to show somebodoy
what i think happens next is i go to show somebody this
"what would a new screening be? is that something else or starting over?
what if someone thinks of something? theres no back button.
Dont want people to think oh I passed, I want to get screened maybe I should take it again
just used my thumb one hand (button size was fine)
otehr questions, things that stood out
