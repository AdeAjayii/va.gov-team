## P1  - Female, late 50s, Non-Vet
- Needed to install the Zoom app to launch the meeting (may be a feature of the ZoomGov account)
- button in bottom center says share content, select screen, select Zoom only, Allow (if prompted), Start Broadcast.

Walking through the screener, "fill this out as if you were a guest arriving at the medical center"
- attention immidieately to the VCL banner
- quickly navigating through the questions, selecting no to all
- reading out the Question 1 of 6 each screen
- Pass - 
-- "ok i got the green light"
-- "this is my pass, it says start a new screerning, since I pass I dont need to."
-- "I like how big the text is"
-- "I think its very clear, yes or no questions, simple to understand"
- Any difficulty? none
- What would you expect to happen next?
-- "I would leave it on this screen/page to show somebodoy
-- "What I think happens next is i go to show somebody this"
-- "What would a new screening be? Is that something else or starting over?
- Other Questions?
-- "What if someone thinks of something? There's no back button."
-- "Dont want people to think oh I passed, I want to get screened maybe I should take it again"
- We are concered about the navigation, was the app easy to use?
-- Just used my thumb one hand (button size was fine)

## P2 - Male, early 20s, Non-Vet
- No problem accessing

- Walking through the screener, "fill this out as if you were a guest arriving at the medical center"
-- reading prompt on homepage
-- "I havent taken my temperature, but didnt notice that I had a problem."
--"Shoot, how did I answer that one, how do I go back?"
-- used the browswer back button (bottom left on Chrome) to get back to the last question

- What would you expect to happen next? PASS
  -- "Show this to a person to show them that i passed, right, then they would let me in?"

Anything you liked or didnt like about the app?
- "Maybe a tap to highlight and tap to confirm"
- "I accidently hit an answer at one point when i was trying to scroll and read"
- "Or mabe like a radio button with a next button at the bottom"
- "It looks like the page requires you to scroll"
- "Seems pretty clear to me"
- Assumed that start a new screening would start over

Walk through the FAIL scenario
- "I figure if someone doesnt pass the pre-screening it would be easy for them to go back and retake the survey and get a pass,
it doesnt have a self-certification"
- "Maybe something that would lock in your answer if you get yes (FAIL) on this screen"

What would you expect to happen next? FAIL
"I would show it to someone and they would give me a mask and gloves and take my temperature."

Any other feedback?
"Seems pretty solid"

How were you holding your phone and using the app?
"I was using one hand (to both hold the phone and use thumb to select) and thats how I accidently hit the wrong button when I tried to scroll."

## P3 - Male, Mid 40s, Veteran
Share - Screen - Zoom - Start Broadcast - Mic Off

Hasnt been to the medical center since COVID. Thinks he has to go soon to transfer between VAMCs. 

How do you feel about going to the VAMC
I would proably feel a little aprehensive, i woul dbe more comfortable doing telehealth or goign to a small less popluated clinic.


Please fill this out as if you were arriving at the medical center.
- Reading the text thoroughly
 -Answered yes to Q4
 -PASS 
-Tapped the resart button
Retaking the app as an employee
More screening needed

"With the first one (PASS), what happens next? I'd like to know. So I guess is that the initial pass that they dont think I have COVID. Maybe let a user know that at this time we do not beleive you need additional COVID testing, let the patient of visotor know what to expect when they get to teh door

i lik the interface, its nice an big (the text), very straightforward
i think someone with PPE, give an example of mask gloves type of thing
other than that i like this.

When I went through and said I had all teh symptoms, the fact that its red tells me probavly not good, im proably going to get tested, as a user i have a little bit of anxt, what should i expect when i get to the door? what happens next?"

What would you expect to happen next?

Anything you liked or didn't like about the app?
No, im a big fan of simplocioty, i think adding more bells and whisteles increases the complexity. especially if someone is alerady feeling anxt, complicatino would only add to that.

Any other feedback?
I thought the start a new screening was to take me to teh next set of questions, liek now that i passed i have another set of questions.

How were you holding your phone and using the app?
"Holding it in my right hand, sitting on counch, using my left thumb to click" "I have tiny hands"


## P4 - Female. Mid 40s. Veteran

Is this a QR code? Because it should be. People should be able to scan so they can fill it out on their way in.

thats good, you have the whole store your data, because they have all teh leak issues, head that off at the pass
this looks good im going to start
my thought with this (Q1) is that in parens put 'family etc other, next to visitor
5 for this question i would say taht its a lot of information right there, it doesnt bother me, btu for some people they would say i dont get this, itsn not hard for me
Q6 I would, you need to say how long have you had this, just a a general how long has this been going on, they could be on a different level of illnes, i had bronchitis.... if someone has any of these issues, you want to know how long tehy have it

FAIL
hit start again
refilling out the screener differently
i went back and looked at it again, and started it over again, thinks Q4 is different this time
I like 6, its asks everything at onece, its a little more well written, you can throw it away if you are going to ask so much information on 4. i would use the term 14 days, since thats a litmus

next
it says PASS great, thats good. I would expect that somebody out there, would say if you have a green come to the right side. they go straight in. they dont need extra system.

FAIL
I would do the tent set up like the milirary, anybody who doesnt have a pass goes to the left and do a swab and get a quick response for posivite or not, 5 minute wait if tehre is a quick test. can people who need treatment emergency.

Other
but in the last 14 days, have you had any of the symptoms, to have bubbles on the bottom to mark which they have and which they dont ahve, id rather see one big questions to see lots of options.

stagger the appointments so that we dont get everyone in one onslaught. for social distancing.

holding in left hand, scrolling down and tapping. easy enough to press and move to the next one. same hand (thumb to navigate).

very simple, easy enought that people not tech savvy shuold be able to do it. demographic of Veterans tends to be older.

have VA folks with a tablet hold it, to allow them to fill it out. people without smart phones.

start a new screening brought everything back to the beginning which is fine.

say thank you for taking the time to do this, and keeping the staff safe. youd be amazed how excited people get. its the simplest thing in the world.

** ask them to fill out the survey then STOP
