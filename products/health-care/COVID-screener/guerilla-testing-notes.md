- Quickly navigating through the questions, selecting no to all
- Reading out the Question 1 of 6 each screen

- "This is my pass, it says start a new screerning, since I pass I dont need to."

Anything you liked or didn't like about the app?
- "I like how big the text is"
- "I think its very clear, yes or no questions, simple to understand"

What would you expect to happen next?
- "I would leave it on this screen/page to show somebodoy."
- "What I think happens next is i go to show somebody this"
- "What would a new screening be? Is that something else or starting over?

How were you holding your phone and using the app?
-Just used my thumb one hand (button size was fine)

Any other feedback?
- "What if someone thinks of something? There's no back button."
- "Dont want people to think oh I passed, I want to get screened maybe I should take it again"

## P2 - Male, early 20s, Non-Vet family member, tech-literate
- No problem accessing

Please fill this out as if you were arriving at the medical center.
- Reading prompt on homepage
- "I havent taken my temperature, but didnt notice that I had a problem."
-"Shoot, how did I answer that one, how do I go back?"
- Used the browswer back button (bottom left on Chrome) to get back to the last question

What would you expect to happen next? PASS
- "Show this to a person to show them that i passed, right, then they would let me in?"

Anything you liked or didnt like about the app?
- "Maybe a tap to highlight and tap to confirm"
- "I accidently hit an answer at one point when i was trying to scroll and read"
- "Or mabe like a radio button with a next button at the bottom"
- "It looks like the page requires you to scroll"
- "Seems pretty clear to me"
- Assumed that start a new screening would start over

What would you expect to happen next? FAIL
- "I figure if someone doesnt pass the pre-screening it would be easy for them to go back and retake the survey and get a pass,
it doesnt have a self-certification"
- "Maybe something that would lock in your answer if you get yes (FAIL) on this screen"
- "I would show it to someone and they would give me a mask and gloves and take my temperature."

Any other feedback?
- "Seems pretty solid"

How were you holding your phone and using the app?
- "I was using one hand (to both hold the phone and use thumb to select) and thats how I accidently hit the wrong button when I tried to scroll."

## P3 - Male, Mid 40s, Veteran
Share - Screen - Zoom - Start Broadcast - Mic Off

How do you feel about going to the VAMC?
- Hasn't been to the medical center since COVID. Thinks he has to go soon to transfer between VAMCs. 
- I would proably feel a little aprehensive, i woul dbe more comfortable doing telehealth or goign to a small less popluated clinic.

Please fill this out as if you were arriving at the medical center.
- Reading the text thoroughly on each screen
- Answered yes to Q4, got to PASS 
- Tapped the resart button, retaking the app as an employee, more screening needed

- "With the first one (PASS), what happens next? I'd like to know."
- "So my guess is that the initial pass that they dont think I have COVID." 
- "Maybe let a user know that at this time we do not beleive you need additional COVID testing, let the patient of visitor know what to expect when they get to the door."

What would you expect to happen next?
- When I went through and said I had all the symptoms, the fact that its red tells me probably not good, I'm proabably going to get tested, as a user I have a little bit of angst, what should I expect when I get to the door? What happens next?"

Anything you liked or didnt like about the app?
- "I like the interface, its nice and big (the text), very straightforward"
- "I think someone with PPE, give an example of mask gloves type of thing, other than that I like this."
- "No, im a big fan of simplocioty, i think adding more bells and whisteles increases the complexity. especially if someone is alerady feeling anxt, complicatino would only add to that."

Any other feedback?
- "I thought the (start a new screening) was to take me to the next set of questions, like now that I passed I have another set of questions to answer."

How were you holding your phone and using the app?
- "Holding it in my right hand, sitting on counch, using my left thumb to click" "I have tiny hands"

## P4 - Female. Mid 40s. Veteran
First Question: "Is this a QR code? Because it should be.People should be able to scan so they can fill it out on their way in."

Please fill this out as if you were arriving at the medical center.

- "Thats good, you have the whole we don't store your data, because they (VA) have all the leak issues, head that off at the pass"
- "This looks good im going to start"
- "My thought with this (Q1) is that in parens put family, etc next to visitor"
- "For this question (Q5) I would say that its a lot of information right there, it doesn't bother me, but for some people they would say I don't get this, its not hard for me."
- (Q6) "I would, you need to say how long have you had this, just a general how long has this been going on, they could be on a different level of illnes, I had bronchitis.... if someone has any of these issues, you want to know how long tehy have it."
- Reached FAIL screen, hit start again
- Re-filling out the screener differently
- "I went back and looked at it again, and started it over again (thinks Q4 is different this time)
- "I like (Q6), it asks everything at once, its a little more well written, you can throw it away if you are going to ask so much information on (Q4). I would use the term 14 days, since thats a litmus.
- Gets to PASS Screen

What would you expect to happen next? PASS

- "It says PASS great, thats good. I would expect that somebody out there, would say if you have a green come to the right side. They go straight in. They dont need extra system."
- "Start a new screening brought everything back to the beginning which is fine."

What would you expect to happen next? FAIL
- "I would do the tent set up like the military, anybody who doesnt have a pass goes to the left and do a swab and get a quick response for posivite or not, 5 minute wait if tehre is a quick test. can people who need treatment emergency.

How were you holding your phone and using the app?
- "Holding in left hand, scrolling down and tapping. Easy enough to press and move to the next one. Same hand (thumb to navigate)."

Any other feedback?
- "But in the last 14 days, have you had any of the symptoms, to have bubbles on the bottom to mark which they have and which they dont have, I'd rather see one big questions to see lots of options."
- "Stagger the appointments so that we dont get everyone in one onslaught. for social distancing."
- "Have VA folks with a tablet hold it, to allow them to fill it out. People without smart phones."
- "Say thank you for taking the time to do this, and keeping the staff safe. youd be amazed how excited people get. its the simplest thing in the world."

Anything you liked or didnt like about the app?
- "Very simple, easy enough that people not tech savvy should be able to do it. Demographic of Veterans tends to be older."

# P5 - Male, Ealry 30s, Veteran, tech-literate

How do you feel about going to the VAMC?
- Took his mom to a local hosptal (not VAMC). He hasnt gone since this started.

Please fill this out as if you were arriving at the medical center.
- "Ok cool, thats easy enough, sadly enough I like the big start button. I like how I dont have to serach for the link."
- visitor, no, no, no, to questions.
- "The thing here (Q4), if I'm in a car, I would rather the symptoms be bulleted out, the CDC website symptoms, its not a paragraph with commas, its bulellted out, thats how I learn but I'm a (explitive) infantryman.
- "PASS!"

What do you think "start new screening" means?
- "I would think that I would go through a whole new screening, I am getting screened again for some reason."

Do you think you have to select that?
- "Yes, i have to for some reason"

What would you expect to happen next? PASS
- "I would assume that reading this, I assume I leave my phone open and walk up and show them the phone, like fifth-element multipass."

Anything you liked or didnt like about the app?
- "Really simple, quick."
- "Only feedback is the one about symptoms, I thought it was a little crowded, I would like it to be bulleted and cleaner, if you are in a car and stressed out."
- "You would probably a little stressed out, mask on your face, stressed out"
- "The looks is really clean and easy, not janky, (no) wasted space, pretty user friendly"

What would you expect to happen next? FAIL
- asked to go back through and FAIL
- "So i would say, that this means, I go in and they are proably going to screen me, I'm giong to see a physician, they will give you like a legit test."
- "I still don't know why I would need to start a new screening here? Do people go and change their first pass honest answers? I dont know who would do that, maybe (they think) like i'ts not that bad, I should fill it out again.
- "Maybe give them a chance to change the answer if they did mess something up
- "Its self explanatory."
- "Is there like a timestamp that kicks you out." So they cant just fill it once and leave it on their phone every day?

How were you holding your phone and using the app?
- Right hand, one hand, with my thumb. holding phone with both hands sometimes.

Any other feedback?
- "I've been to Iraqi, Iran, in the desert. I can kick this things ass. I refuse to wear a mask to the barber shop."
- "I've been seeing a lot on the NCO threads and the (unit) facebook, that people are isolated. I've seen a lot of posts about saying they are feeling down. It's great to see the swarm of responses though. A post like that will get 70-80 responses. I am curious to see if there is an uptick in people reaching-out."
