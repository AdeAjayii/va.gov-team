*Attendees:*
- Patrick Bateman
- Paul Crews, Durham VA Healthcare System Executive Director

### Current state

- 80K veterans
- main facility is 1M sq ft building
- 4K people entering every day
- currently at 50% reduced capacity
  - only inpatient
  - no visitors
- still 2K per day
- only two entrances are open (down from how many?)
### Current process
- every person is required to screen once per day
- 4 - 5 people to do screening per entrance
- people queue up
- if they pass, they get a colored sticker
- can in / out with the sticker
- some stack ups at shift change times
- **worried about the reopening** and getting back to full capacity
### Where did this come from?
- Calling it "ScreenPass"
- Did not want covid in the name so it could be extended to other purposes maybe
- asking themselves, how can we be like the TSA / TSA precheck?
- Senior medical exec's kid wrote the script
- Served it up himself on his own equipment (let's hire this kid!)
- Walk in, scan QR code, go through ScreenPass, if screen turns red, you have to go to traditional
- Have written up an SOP and are going to test it out next week

### What's next?
- Plan is to roll it out next week, test, see what works/what doesn't
- Collect feedback from the test
- Will connect Jeff with Durham research person
- Will be served on Angela's infra
- Already printed signs

### What can we do?
- Wants help with making this official
- Wants to make sure this scales
- Very happy for the help
