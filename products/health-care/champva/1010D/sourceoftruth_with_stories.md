[Current PDF Form](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/medical/pdf/VA_Form_10-10d.pdf)

## Introduction page

## [H1] Apply for CHAMPVA benefits

{ subtitle } Form 10-10d

Are you the spouse, surviving spouse, child or caretaker of a Veteran who is permanently and totally disabled or a Veteran who has died? If you don’t qualify for [TRICARE](https://www.tricare.mil/) (the Department of Defense’s health care program for active-duty and retired service members and their families), you may be able to get health benefits through the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA). Through this program, we cover the cost of some of your health care services and supplies. This is called cost sharing.
<br/>
###  [H2] What benefits do I get with CHAMPVA?
You may use CHAMPVA as a standalone service or as an additional health benefit to supplement your other health insurance or Medicare.


With CHAMPVA, you’ll be covered for services and supplies when we determine they are medically necessary and were received from an authorized provider. When providers are performing services within the scope of their license or certification, we consider them to be authorized.

#### [H3] Covered services include:
- Ambulance service
- Ambulatory surgery
- Durable medical equipment (DME)
- Family planning and maternity
- Hospice
- Inpatient services
- Mental health services
- Outpatient services
- Pharmacy (prescription medicines)
- Skilled nursing care
- Transplants<br/>


When you’re signed up for CHAMPVA, you’ll get a copy of the CHAMPVA Program Guide. This guide will tell you more about covered and non-covered services and supplies.

###  [H2] How CHAMPVA is different from your health insurance?

CHAMPVA is not health insurance but it shares the cost of certain medically necessary procedures and supplies with eligible beneficiaries. We do not have a network of health care providers, so you can visit most authorized providers.
You can use CHAMPVA to share costs that Medicare or your insurance doesn't cover. CHAMPVA can also act as a standalone service help share costs and save on health care services and supplies. 


###  [H2] Am I eligible for health benefits through CHAMPVA?

You may be eligible for CHAMPVA health benefits if don't qualify for TRICARE and the Veteran you're connected to (called your "sponsor") can be described as at least one of the following,


- Has been rated permanently and totally disabled for a service-connected disability by a VA regional office
- Has died from a VA-rated service-connected disability
- Was at the time of death rated permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected disability
- Has died in the line of duty, not due to misconduct

####  [H3] What is a service-connected disability? 
A service-connected disability is a disability that we’ve concluded was caused—or made worse—by the Veteran’s active-duty service. A permanent disability is one that’s not expected to improve.

If the Veteran fits that description and your status and relationship match the following the factors below you may be eligible for CHAMPVA benefits. 

Depending on your relationship to the Veteran sponsoring your application and your enrollment in other health insurance programs, you may need to submit additional forms or files. The enrollment form will guide you on what you’ll need. 


Please click on the description that matches your status to learn more about your potential eligibility and the additional documents you’ll need:
