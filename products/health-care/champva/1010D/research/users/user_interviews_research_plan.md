# User Interviews Research Plan for Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) Team, Form 10-10D, December 2023
**This file IS NOT ready for review.**

## Background
This research will consist of open-ended questions regarding [Form 10-10D](https://www.va.gov/find-forms/about-form-10-10d/), which is a component of the application for [CHAMPVA benefits](https://www.va.gov/health-care/family-caregiver-benefits/champva/). At the time this research plan is being written, Form 10-10D is a fillable PDF that applicants must print and mail in. The overall goal of the [project](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/1010D/product-outline.md) is to create a fully digitized form that Veterans and/or family members can use to streamline their application process.

The purpose of this research is to explore the process of applying for CHAMPVA benefits and filling out Form 10-10D to identify opportunities to improve the experience. Based on participant feedback, we will iterate on the prototype presented in design intent, conduct at least one round of [user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/champva/1010D/research/users/user_testing_research_plan.md), and implement the new Form 10-10D on va.gov.

### OCTO Priorities 
1. Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
2. Drive OIT’s Digital Transformation Strategy

### Veteran Journey
- Putting down roots
  - Moment: taking care of my family

## Research Goals	
The goals of this research are to:

1. Understand the user experience in applying for CHAMPVA benefits
2. Identify current pain points with the CHAMPVA application process and Form 10-10D specifically 
3. Determine user wants and needs for the CHAMPVA application process and Form 10-10D specifically

### Research questions
**For users that have applied for CHAMPVA benefits in the past:**
1. Why do participants apply for CHAMPVA benefits?
2. What were participants' experiences when applying for CHAMPVA benefits?
3. How do particpants believe the application process can be improved?
   
**For users that have never applied for CHAMPVA benefits:**
4. Why have these participants not applied for CHAMPVA benefits?
5. What difficiulties do participants expect when applying for CHAMPVA benefits?
6. How do participants believe that a digitization effort could improve the application process?

### Hypotheses
**For users that have applied for CHAMPVA benefits in the past:**
1. Participants who **have** applied for CHAMPVA benefits will have done so because they believe they will substantially benefit from the program.
2. Participants experience confusion and frustration around the application process, especially surrounding supplementary documentation.
3. Participants will hope that, because VA has much of the information that Form 10-10D asks for, much of the process can be automated for them.
   
**For users that have never applied for CHAMPVA benefits:**
4. Participants who **have not** applied for CHAMPVA benefits will not have done so because they do not understand the benefits of the program or because they believe the application will be too difficult.
5. Participants will expect the application process to be confusing and that it will take a long time.
6. Participants will hope that the digitization effort will reduce the amount of time it will take to apply for benefits, or that they can be directly matched with programs that will benefit them.

### Outcome
The findings from this research will: 
- Illuminate the user experience when applying for CHAMPVA benefits and how the digitization efforts can improve the experience
- Provide insights to understand the service design of the CHAMPVA program
- Provide insights needed to iterate upon and refine our initial prototype of Form 10-10D before user testing

## Methodology	
**Open-ended user interivews**

Open-ended user interivews will be conducted remotely via Zoom using the Perigean contract. A remote moderator will begin with warm-up questionss. They participants will then be asked a series of questions about their experience with or perception of applying for CHAMPVA benefits.

Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

## [WIP] Participants and Recruitment	

### [WIP] Recruitment approach
Our intended audience is Veterans, spouses of Veterans, and family Caregivers for Veterans who can sponsor or are eligible for CHAMPVA benefits. Participants will be recruited by Perigean.

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### [WIP] Recruitment criteria
We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 15 full sessions. Therefore, we request that 20 sessions be scheduled.

**[WIP] Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- User groups:
	- At least 4 Veterans
	- At least 9 spouses of Veterans or family caregivers
- Application status:
	- 60% have applied for CHAMPVA benefits
 	- 40% have not applied for CHAMPVA benefits, but are eligible for the program	  

What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**[WIP] Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## [WIP] Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### [WIP] Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### [WIP] Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### [WIP] Length of sessions
* Session length: 45 - 60 minutes
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes 
* Maximum Sessions per day: 3 sessions

### [WIP] Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## [WIP] Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
