# Conversation Guide: User Interviews for Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) Team, Form 10-10D, December 2023

## Moderator Logistics
- Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Before the session, send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).
- Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute.
- In the Audio section, tap the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro.
- Have a link to the current PDF version of 10-10D ready to share for the particpant to reference, if they need to look at the form to jog their memory.

## Introduction (5 minutes)
(_Begin recording.)_
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Rachael and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to discuss your experience with the application process for applying for CHAMPVA benefits, and Form 10-10D specifically.
- The entire session should last no more than 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. If we have time at the end of the session, some of my colleagues who are observing may have some follow-up questions to ask you.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We just want to improve these processes and forms to better meet the needs of Veteran sponsors and their beneficiaries. I will not be offended by any opinions that you express, and they will not affect your benefits in any way. I welcome any any all feedback you have to offer.
- We are recording this session, but no one outside of our research team will have access to it. The recording is only to make sure we accurately and fully capture your feedback. Once we've done that and completed our analysis, the recording will be destroyed.
- If for any reason you want to take a break or stop the session, please let me know.
What questions do you have about the introduction I've just given you?
Do we have your consent to continue with this conversation and recording? (_If no, end the interview.)_
Great. Let's begin!
