1. The claims submission process is "very complicated" and its better to have another team handle all the backend.
2. There is a contract in place to build a "portal" to accept the 7959A form, therefore OCTO should not prioritize this work.![image](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/assets/49729315/4c85ed8f-a57f-4b24-b71d-c092873b2b2d)
