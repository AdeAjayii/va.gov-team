### Discussion
1. These claims are what we call Shoe box claims with VFMP, folks mail in a bunch of claims to the CHAMPVA process.
1. The claims submission process is "very complicated" and its better to have another team handle all the backend.
2. There is a contract in place to build a "portal" to accept the 7959A form, therefore OCTO should not prioritize this work.
1. This was new information to Katrina and she said that she will work with the business to understand what is happening with this work.
