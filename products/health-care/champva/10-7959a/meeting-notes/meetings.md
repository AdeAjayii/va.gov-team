- George Brittingham
- Katrina Fluss
### Discussion
1. These claims are what we call Shoe box claims with VFMP, folks mail in a bunch of claims to the CHAMPVA process.  
1. The claims submission process is "very complicated" and its better to have another team handle all the backend.
   - claims are unique and different from the rest of the forms
   - need to come through standard processes (industry wide standards in place)
   - PHI, PII - security around this is already part of the process that's there
3. There is a contract in place to build a "portal" to accept the 7959A form, therefore OCTO should not prioritize this work.
   - portal would allow claims to be entered by beneficiary and converted to electronic form 
1. This was new information to Katrina and she said that she will work with the business to understand what is happening with this work.
   - claims are very different - there may be room for different solutions
