# Integrated Health: Veteran and Family Member Modernization Project
*Formerly known as ```IVC Portal```, ```Community Care Portal```*

## Background
The Office of Integrated Veteran Care (IVC) is responsible for implementing a broad range of programs, including:
- Community Care (Mission Act)
- Veteran Foreign Medical Program
- Veteran Family Member Benefits (such as Camp Lejeune, CHAMP VA)
- Spina Bifida
- VA & Community care Appointments
- and more

### History
This effort began several years ago when the Mission Act came out, which spelled out that Veterans were required to have a patient portal for community care. Dr. Kameron Matthews (former VHA CMIO) decided that it was foolish to create a NEW patient portal outside of VA.gov, and indicated that it should be built on VA.gov instead. 

A team outside of OCTO was hired to research and design the features for this community care patient portal. [Artifacts for that effort can be found here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/community-care/community-care-portal). The team conducted some research, focused on solutions Veterans WANT, versus the problems Veterans needed help solving, and created designs for a community care patient portal on VA.gov with features that were not based in technical reality, and were independent of VA.gov's design system, information architecture, or content standards. This research was presented to IVC, and the features of the design were turned into a long list of requirements. 

Separately, the IDEA Act came out, which required VA to digitize all user-facing forms. A team under OCTO started the process of digitizing these forms. Congress is particularly interested in a suite of forms that would enable Veterans in the foreign medical program, as well as Veterans' family members to be able to apply for and manage certain benefits online. 

All of the requirements for the community care portal and the VFMP focus were batched into one giant requiements document, which became, eventually, the **Integrated Helath Veteran & Family Member Modernization Project**. 

OCTO reviewed the list of requirements and determined that:
- some % of the features requested already existed on VA.gov (i.e. the 1010ez)
- some % were net new features (such as the CHAMP VA form)
- some should be integrated into existing VA.gov products (decision reviews, debt management, facility locator)
- some are not technically feasible or advisable.
(See original document breaking down the work)

OCTO proposed an organization of IVC's requirements that breaks the work into chunks:
- Digitizing forms
- Letters
- Community care appointments and scheduling
- Community care patient portal features
- Decision reviews
- Finances (money in, money out)
- VA Profile
- Contact Center/Help/Chat/Feedback 
- Content

In Fall 2023, a team was hired to start on the **Digitizing forms** part of the work. 

Who are the users and what do we know about them
What is the problem they are having and why are they having it?
What business outcomes are trying to be achieved by solving for that problem?
With who do we expect the team will need to collaborate with but inside and out of OCTO to solve the problem?
What unique factors exist like legislative pressures or constraints?
What commitments have already been made, to whom, and at what level of fidelity?
What are the biggest known risks?
