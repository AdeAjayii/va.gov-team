# AVS Gap Analysis 

## Background

**AVS** is a web-based interface launched from the CPRS Tools menu that provides a summary of the visit. It includes information about diagnoses, vitals, new orders, upcoming appointments, provider comments/instructions, as well as information pertaining to the patient's ongoing care, including the primary care provider, allergies, and the medication list. The AVS supports various clinical worksflows - Providers can run AVS alongside CPRS and interact directly with the AVS to add content, clinic staff can printout the AVS when the patient is checking out, the AVS can be printed and mailed after the encounter. AVS is automatically uploaded as a PDF document to VistA Imaging when the AVS is first printed.

Cerner's version of an AVS document is the **Ambulatory Visit Summary**. Similarly, the Ambulatory Visit Summary includes clinical information about the visit, as well as provider instructions, ongoing care information, and the medication list. Cerner's Ambulatory Visit Summary is native to Powerchart and the document will generate when providers and clinical staff go through the discharge process. Data from the visit, as well as pertinent ongoing care data, will pull into the document. This document is reviewed along with making any additions and modifications. Upon completion, the document is saved as a Clinical Note to the chart and can be printed.

To support the Patient Check-in Integration project with Cerner, the team would like to have a better understanding of how the AVS compares to Cerner's Ambulatory Visit Summary. The comparison should include specific data points, clinical workflow, Veteran facing impacts, continued development and agility of the tools, and any outstanding issues or concerns from clinical users. 

The goal of this Gap Analysis is to provide the information needed for decision-making efforts. Any additional discoveries should be added here to provide a comprehensive resource.
