# Community Care Portal in va.gov 

## Product description 
This effort is being led by the Veterans Experience Office on behalf of the Office of Community Care. 

In the original Mission Act legislation, all of the community care provider networks were asked to set up a patient portal for Veteran recipients. Dr. Matthews asked instead that we build a community care portal on va.gov. VEO has taken on the initial design and user research work. 

Office of the CTO and VEO are eager to ensure that the products that the VEO team designs are integrated with existing products on VA.gov. This team will be working closely with the digital health modernization team, as well as the benefits team.
