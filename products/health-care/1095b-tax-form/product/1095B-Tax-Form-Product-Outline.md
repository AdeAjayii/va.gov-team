# 1095-B Tax Form Product Outline


---

## Overview
Form 1095-B reports the months a person had qualifying minimum health coverage to the IRS. The VA sends this form to Veterans to show what months they were covered under the VA healthcare system. In most cases, it is simply a form for one's records. However, some states still have an individual coverage mandate, and in those states, the form is necessary for filing taxes. 

## Problem Statement
Currently, form 1095-B is mailed to veterans. Sending it out costs the VA approximately $1.5 million, and an additional $400,000 if they have to re-send it due to an error on the form. What's more, the form isn't available online, so if a Veteran loses the form, they have no easy way to get an immediate replacement. 
* How might we make the digital form easily accessible to Veterans?
* How might we provide Veterans a clear escalation path if there's an error on the form?
* How might we let Veterans choose whether to keep receiving a physical form?



 
## Desired User Outcomes
As a Veteran, I:
- Can easily access my 1095-B form while logged into my VA.gov account 
- Know how to address an error on the form
- Can choose to no longer receive a physical copy of the form in the mail




## Desired Business Outcomes
- Increased satisfaction with VA digital experience
- Decreased cost of sending physical mail



---
## Measuring success 

-	The cost of sending the forms decreases
-	The porportion of Veterans who search for and find the 1095-B form increases
-	Timeline to accessing the form, fixing an error, and receiving an updated form is reduced

## Assumptions and Risks
-	Getting access to the data that populates the form
-	Ability to launch without formal IRS review


## Solution Approach

- We are currently in the data and design discovery phase. We plan to speak with users and test designs with them in February, build and test in March, and launch our MVP April 1.


## Go-to-market Strategy
- Announcements to be made in newsletters, emails, and social media to notify veterans of the form being available online
- Call center to have updated materials on how to guide veterans to find the form

## Launch Dates
- *Target Launch Date* 
  - April 1
- *What date will you evaluate impact after launch (and when do you expect to have your Impact Review)?*
  - May 1
