All incident response related information is in our [incident response plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/1095b-tax-form/product/incident-response-plan.md). 


# Annual changes

When we load the data for the next tax year into the vets-api database, we keep the data from the previous tax year. For example, if we start loading the data for 2022, we'll keep the 2021 data in the database. 

Eventually, the 1095-B page will want to allow users to be able to view their forms from previous years. Keeping the data around helps us do that.
