## Intro - 5 minutes

*MODERATOR*: Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we'll ask you to help us test va.gov on a topic related to healthcare and tax documentation. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take less than 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions

*MODERATOR*: Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, as about location, occupation, military service history)

## Interview

*MODERAOR*: To start, I'd like to ask you a few questions about your usage of VA benefits and digital services. 

- Are you currently enrolled in the VA healthcare system and use any of those benefits? 
    - A [IF NO] Do you get health insurance from an employer or pay out of pocket?    

- Are you familiar with a form called the 1095-B? 
    - A [IF NO] It's ok! I wasn't really either! It's a form that shows proof of health insurance that you might receive from the VA or an employer. In previous years you might have included it with your taxes to show the IRS you were covered with health insurance. 

- Do you recall ever getting someting like that in the mail from VA or maybe an employer? 

- Do you do taxes yourself or with your spouse? Do you ever use tax filing software like Turbo Tax? 

## First Task: [Participant loads 1095-B page] - X minutes

*MODERATOR* We've taken the first step in making the 1095-B form available online. Let's first load the page where the form is available for download. I'm going to put the link to the page in the Zoom chat. Let's go ahead and load that page. 

Please think aloud and walk me through what you see on the screen.

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
