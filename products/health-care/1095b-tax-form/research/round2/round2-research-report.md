# Background

Currently, form 1095-B is mailed to Veterans. Sending it out costs the VA approximately $1.5 million, and an additional $400,000 if they have to re-send it due to an error on the form. What&#39;s more, the form isn&#39;t available online, so if a Veteran loses the form, they have no easy way to get an immediate replacement. [Link to product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/1095b-tax-form/product/1095B-Tax-Form-Product-Outline.md)

## Research Goals

- Better understand how Veterans might find, use, and edit a digital copy of the 1095b form
- Discover needs, pain points and preferences for physical or digital delivery of the form
- Test usability of proposed solution

## Research Questions

- Are Veterans familiar with the 1095b form, why they might need it and what is their experience of receiving it in the past?
- Do Veterans prefer a physical or digital copy of the form? Why might a Veteran opt out of future physical delivery of a form?
- What are the strategies and touchpoints a Veteran might use for locating the form online?

## Overview &amp; Methods

- 8 30-minute research sessions with Veterans completed, 
  - 12 scheduled: 8 completed, 3 cancelled, 1 no show
- 2 Parts of the session included: 10 minute interview, 20 minute think aloud usability test with prototype of proposed solution
- All sessions conducted remotely via Zoom

# Overall Findings

- **8/8** Participants successfully completed the task: Sign in, View 1095-B Form, then Download or Print
- **7/8** Participants would prefer updating incorrect information on the website rather than calling the enrollment line
- **6/7** Participants thought the 1095-B landing page made sense as part of the Records section of the VA website. 
  - _Note: due to 1 participant being late to the session, we didn’t get to ask this question_
- **6/8** Participants would prefer receiving the 1095-B form on the VA website rather than getting a paper copy in the mail.
  - 1/8 would prefer both, 1/8 would prefer paper
  - All participants lived in states that don’t require proof of health care to file State taxes
