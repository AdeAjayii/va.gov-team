# Background

Currently, form 1095-B is mailed to Veterans. Sending it out costs the VA approximately $1.5 million, and an additional $400,000 if they have to re-send it due to an error on the form. What&#39;s more, the form isn&#39;t available online, so if a Veteran loses the form, they have no easy way to get an immediate replacement.

## Research Goals

- Better understand how Veterans might find, use, and edit a digital copy of the 1095b form
- Discover needs, pain points and preferences for physical or digital delivery of the form
- Test usability of proposed solution

## Research Questions

- Are Veterans familiar with the 1095b form, why they might need it and what is their experience of receiving it in the past?
- Do Veterans prefer a physical or digital copy of the form? Why might a Veteran opt out of future physical delivery of a form?
- What are the strategies and touchpoints a Veteran might use for locating the form online?

## Overview &amp; Methods

- 8 30-minute research sessions with Veterans completed, 
  - 12 scheduled: 8 completed, 3 cancelled, 1 no show
- 2 Parts of the session included: 10 minute interview, 20 minute think aloud usability test with prototype of proposed solution
- All sessions conducted remotely via Zoom

# Overall Findings

- **8/8** Participants successfully completed the task: Sign in, View 1095-B Form, then Download or Print
- **7/8** Participants would prefer updating incorrect information on the website rather than calling the enrollment line
- **6/7** Participants thought the 1095-B landing page made sense as part of the Records section of the VA website. 
  - _Note: due to 1 participant being late to the session, we didn’t get to ask this question_
- **6/8** Participants would prefer receiving the 1095-B form on the VA website rather than getting a paper copy in the mail.
  - 1/8 would prefer both, 1/8 would prefer paper
  - All participants lived in states that don’t require proof of health care to file State taxes

## Themes

- Do I need this?
- Fixing the 1095-B Form

### Theme: Do I need this?

During the initial interview, we spoke to participants about their understanding of the 1095-B tax form and how they used it when filing their taxes. When asked “Do you know if the 1095-B form is required when you’re filing taxes?” we saw the same theme of confusion over requirements that we saw in the first round of testing.

- 1 Participant thought it was a requirement to include the form when filing taxes
- 2  Participants were unsure if it was required, but reported including it with their taxes last year
- 3 Participants thought it was unneeded to include in tax filing, but kept it for their records
- 1 Participant reported shredding it because they didn’t need it
- 1 Participant wasn’t familiar with the form and didn’t recall ever receiving it in the mail

> “I don't really need it…[but] I filed it with my income tax paperwork. I don't know that anybody really needs it. Because there doesn't seem to be a lot of follow up with the IRS.”

– Participant 11

**After completing the task with the prototype, and seeing copy regarding 1095-B requirements (above), one participant asked:**

> "It says due to changes to the Affordable Care Act, this document is no longer required to file your federal taxes. So why do they still send it out? Because its no longer required."

– Participant 3

### Theme: Fixing the form ###

**6/8** Participants found the Help sections and said they would call the enrollment phone number to fix any mistakes on the form.

However, **3/8** Participants would first try selecting “Change Your Address” before calling the enrollment center (see below).

**7/8** Participants said they would prefer to correct any mistakes on the form digitally, either by filling in a form or sending a secure message. 
Some reasons being:

- “[With an online form] I could get a digital receipt” -P4
- “I prefer secure messaging if someone got back to you to confirm it was changed.” –P1

The remaining participant preferred the phone or visiting the VA in person so “I don’t have to worry about making a mistake.” This participant was elderly, rarely used their computer and still filed their taxes using paper forms. 



# Recommendations

- Design is strong and ready to launch
- Add additional content on “Change Your Address” landing page directing user to call enrollment center, should they follow that path to update the form
- Consider adding online form on authenticated 1095-B page to easily update address or other incorrect information, preventing the user from following other paths or making a phone call (Post MVP).
