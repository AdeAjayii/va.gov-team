# Research Plan for the MyHealtheVet landing page, January 2022

## Goals
The intent of the homepage is to be a centralized hub for veterans to manage their healthcare.

In terms of the Veteran, the goal of this research is this: “I can get what I need related to health.” 

From our team’s perspective, we are testing the IA of the site. We want to ensure the landing page has clear paths to key information in the site since we are bringing My HealtheVet, the VA.gov Health care hub, and other health content under one “roof.”

* At this point, we are not working on user flows. We are testing the findability of key health tasks and info from the My HealtheVet authenticated landing page. 

### Background
This project maintains the vision of the Digital Modernization Strategy set in 2017: to provide a single, high-quality digital version of every health product or tool, plus the ability for a Veteran to see all of their health-related VA benefits in one place on VA.gov.

This study will build off of the results of our [informal user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-guerilla-test-12-2021/2021-12-guerilla-research-report.pdf), conducted in December 2021. 

### Research questions
This study focuses on 2 main areas:
* **Critical tasks:** Can veterans find key tasks and information when prompted?
* **Content balance:** Do Veterans go to content pages (instructional, policies, etc.) expecting to be able to perform a task?

### Hypotheses
For each question above, respectively, we believe the following:
* When given a task, Veterans will be able to find the corresponding action link that enables them to initiate that task. 
* When given a task, a Veteran won't click on a content page to initiate that task.

## Method
We will ask Veterans what health tasks they do and what health tasks they do online. When we do this we will:
1. Write down their tasks
2. Have them show us how they do the simplest task
3. Ask them to do two of their tasks on the concept for the My HealtheVet authenticated landing page 
4. Ask them to do several tasks to ensure that the landing page has clear paths to key information in the site.

For testing the mobile concept, we'll use Zoom and staging on VA.gov

Here is the [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-formal-research-12-2021/Conversation-guide.md).

## Location
We'll conduct user research remotely online using the account associated with Perigean

## Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research is Veterans. We are planning to recruit through Perigean. We will use a lean maximum variation strategy in our recruiting strategy. 

## Recruitment criteria

### Total number of recruits
12 veterans

### Primary criteria
* Ideally get at least 4 participants who currently manage their healthcare through MHV
* Age: At least 4 people age 55+

### Secondary criteria
* Gender: At least 4 women
* Inclusion: 
  * At least 2 people of color
  * At least one person who identifies as LGBTQ+
* Geography: Participants from East Coast, West Coast, and the Midwest
* Disability: At least three participants who use DAT

**What we expect to learn:**
* Veterans who have "most common tasks" will show us whether those tasks are present and accessible on the new My HealtheVet landing page concept
* Some of the tasks we'll ask Veterans to find and initiatiate ([see conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-formal-research-12-2021/MyHealtheVet-authenticated-landing-page-Conversation-guide.md)) are pulled directly from our [IA Tree Test](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/IA-tree-test-11-2021/IA-tree-test-analysis.md), and had some of the lowest success rates from that test. This research should teach us whether the proposed homepage concept improves the success rate of those tasks.
