# Research Plan for Apartment IA Proof of Concept Testing, October 2021
## Goals

The VFS-APT team is conducting research to validate the IA of the health apartment proof of concept (POC) and discoverability of health things within the apartment. The outcome of this tree test research will provide us with insights into what works and what needs work from the start. The tree test will also give us a clear, quantifiable benchmark to improve on in our iterations. 

**BACKGROUND** 

This project maintains the vision of the Digital Modernization Strategy set in 2017: to simplify and unify the Veteran health experience into a single front door by bringing all things health, including My HealtheVet, into VA.gov. We will create an accessible, usable, and discoverable health "home".


**RESEARCH QUESTIONS** 

See 'Tasks' below for a detailed list. Overall, 12 tasks were prioritized to balance thoroughness with an appropriate cognitive load for Veterans; see 'Method' below for additional information on how these tasks were prioritized based on various analytics.


## Method	
Based on [prior work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1) and [subsequent recommendations](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/health-apartment-ia), we will conduct this first round of research via tree test to understand the discoverability of tasks and to validate the organization of information in the apartment. The tree test (built in Treejack by Optimal Workshop) will be pilot tested by Veterans on the internal team for clarity, timing, and general feedback prior to using it with Perigean recruits. This research will be asychronous (i.e., no live moderation), with opportunity for participants to share additional thoughts during the test itself. 

To balance comprehensiveness with cognitive load, we decided to test no more than 20 tasks per study. Here's how we prioritized which tasks we should test first. 
* We prioritized tasks/topics that we had questions about -- meaning things that didn't fit well in the existing MHV or VA.gov structure.
* We then cross-referenced top search terms with top tasks -- assuming that these are high-need, low-discoverability items. [Go to our analytics page for more information.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/analytics/Analytics.md) 

*Note: Because the "big 4" tools (messages, appointments, pharmacy, and records) are well understood in MHV, the apartment POC did not make major shifts to them. Thus, we are not testing them in this first tree test.

### Tasks
The prioritized 12 tasks, linked to our testing objective, were carefully curated such that they reflect how Veterans might naturally approach the website. We ensured that the answer wasn't given away by using the same language that’s in tree itself while also being written in plain language. The parentheticals describe the general goal of the task.

1.  You need to see a podiatrist, but live 110 miles away from the closest VA podiatrist. You want to find out whether you're eligible to see a non-VA doctor for this. (learning about community care)

2. You've determined you are eligible to see this podiatrist. How would you go about seeing this doctor? (viewing and managing appointments)

3. You have a 30% disability rating. You want to learn what health benefits your disability rating qualifies you for. (learning about disability benefits)

4. Your VA doctor prescribed you a hearing aid. After a few months, the battery has died. You want to order a replacement battery. (ordering health supplies)

5. You drove to your primary care appointment at VA. How would you go about getting reimbursed for gas? (requesting travel pay)

6. You were notified that you have an outstanding amount for a VA appointment. You want to find out how much you owe. (viewing health bills and payment history)

7. You need to go to the dentist. How would you find out what coverage you qualify for? (learning about dental benefits)

8. You have just received a diagnosis for PTSD. You want to find resources to help manage it. (learning about specific health conditions (i.e., research health))

9. Your doctor told you that you have high blood pressure and asked you to track those numbers online between visits. How would you enter that information? (tracking self-entered health data)

10. You want to subscribe to the My HealtheVet newsletter. (reading or subscribing to the MHV newsletter)

11. You had some blood tests done at VA this week and you want to see those results. (viewing labs & test results)

12. You got married and you want to add your spouse as a dependent to your plan. (managing benefits)

Post-study question: On what page would you expect to find anything COVID-19 related?


## Participants and Recruitment	
Perigean will recruit and schedule 60 qualified participants for each of the 6 groups outlined below (10 participants in each group). 

**PRIMARY CRITERIA**

***Groups***

We will be testing with these 6 groups. The details of the recruitment needs are below. (Minimum numbers are provided for the must-have criteria and segmentation.)

See attached Excel file for screening questions.


**SECONDARY CRITERIA**

Gender:
- At least 6 women

Inclusion:
- At least 18 people of color

Geographic distribution:*
- 25 participants from the east coast
- 10 participants from the mid west
- 25 participants from the west coast
*For consideration: We could match this section to “25% in a rural area” and also request “15 participants from a rural area, and X participants from a city” (vs. east, mid, west)

**Across the 6 study groups, we would like the sample to include the below targets. 
- 50% aged 55-64+
- 50% with an identified cognitive disability
- 50% primarily mobile users (it is not required to participate on mobile)
- 30% people of color
- 25% in a rural area
- 25% without a degree
- 17% with immigrant origins
- 10% women

If feasible, we also recommend recruiting at least one participant from the following underserved communities:
- Native American Veterans, who have the highest per-capita involvement of any population to serve in the U.S. military.
- Veterans in the LGTBQ+ community, given recent direction from the VA secretary for a review of VA policies to ensure that transgender Veterans and employees do not face discrimination on the basis of their gender identity and expression.
- Veterans with other than honorable discharge.
- Immigrant Veterans or Veterans from immigrant families.
- Veterans living abroad
- Non-English speakers

Notes on decisions for above criteria:
- We assume that the IA doesn't need to be tested specifically on a mobile device as it is the tree only, not a wireframe designed for mobile or desktop specifically. We recommend recruiting for participants to conduct testing on mobile devices at later stages.
