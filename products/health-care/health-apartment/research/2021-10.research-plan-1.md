# Research Plan for Apartment IA Proof of Concept Testing, October 2021
## Goals

The VFS-APT team is conducting research to validate the IA of the health apartment proof of concept (POC) and discoverability of health things within the apartment. The outcome of this tree test research will provide us with insights into what works and what needs work from the start. The tree test will also give us a clear, quantifiable benchmark to improve on in our iterations. 

**Background** 

This project maintains the vision of the Digital Modernization Strategy set in 2017: to provide a single, high-quality digital version of every health product or tool, plus the ability for a Veteran to see all of their VA benefits - health, disabililty, education, and other - in one place, on VA.gov.

**Research Questions** 

See 'Tasks' below for a detailed list. Overall, 12 tasks were prioritized to balance thoroughness with an appropriate cognitive load for Veterans; see 'Method' below for additional information on how these tasks were prioritized based on various analytics.


## Method	
Based on prior work (link to research plan, findings) and subsequent recommendations (link to Emily's thoughts file), we will conduct this first round of research via tree test to understand the discoverability of tasks and to validate the organization of information in the apartment. The tree test (built in Treejack by Optimal Workshop) will be pilot tested by Veterans on the internal team for clarity, timing, and general feedback prior to using it with Perigean recruits. This research will be asychronous (i.e., no live moderation), with opportunity for participants to share additional thoughts during the test itself. 

To balance comprehensiveness with cognitive load, we decided to test no more than 20 tasks per study. Here's how we prioritized which tasks we should test first. 
* We prioritized tasks/topics that we had questions about -- meaning things that didn't fit well in the existing MHV or VA.gov structure.
* We then cross-referenced top search terms with top tasks -- assuming that these are high-need, low-discoverability items. [Go to our analytics page for more information.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/analytics/Analytics.md) 

*Note: Because the "big 4" tools (messages, appointments, pharmacy, and records) are well understood in MHV, the apartment POC did not make major shifts to them. Thus, we are not testing them in this first tree test.

### Tasks
The prioritized 12 tasks, linked to our testing objective, were carefully curated such that they reflect how Veterans might naturally approach the website. We ensured that the answer wasn't given away by using the same language that’s in tree itself while also being written in plain language. The parentheticals describe the general goal of the task.

1.  You need to see a podiatrist, but live 110 miles away from the closest VA podiatrist. You want to find out whether you're eligible to see a non-VA doctor for this. (learning about community care)

2. You've determined you are eligible to see this podiatrist. How would you go about seeing this doctor? (viewing and managing appointments)

3. You have a 30% disability rating. You want to learn what benefits your disability rating qualifies you for. (learning about disability benefits)

4. Your VA doctor prescribed you a hearing aid. After a few months, the battery has died. You want to order a battery replacement. (ordering health supplies (e.g., hearing aid batteries))

5. You drove to your primary care appointment at VA. You want to get reimbursed for gas. (requesting travel pay)

6. You are notified that you have an outstanding amount due. You want to review your last payment. (viewing health bills and payment history)

7. You need to go to the dentist. You want to know how much this visit will cost you. (learning about dental benefits)

8. You have just received a diagnosis for PTSD. You want to learn about resources to help. (learning about specific health conditions (i.e., research health))

9. Your doctor told you that you have high blood pressure and requested that you track those numbers on VA.gov between visits. How would you enter that information? (tracking self-entered health data)

10. You want to subscribe to the My HealtheVet newsletter. (reading or subscribing to the MHV newsletter)

11. You had some blood tests done at VA this week and you want to see those results. (viewing labs & test results)

POST STUDY QUESTIONS
What page would you expect to find anything COVID-19 related? 

## Participants and Recruitment	
Perigean will recruit and schedule # qualified participants for each group outlined below.

### Recruitment (FROM EMILY; NEEDS TO BE PARSED OUT IN FORMAT LIKE BELOW)
*Consider segmenting each group by age (e.g. under/over 45) or gender identity.*
* **Familiar with MHV**  -- Veterans who are enrolled in VA health care, AND have signed in to MHV in the last 6 months
* **Not familiar with MHV but have health care** -- Veterans who are enrolled in VA health care AND  do not sign in to the MHV patient portal regularly
* **Not enrolled in VA health care** -- Veterans who are not currently enrolled in health care. (Maybe add disability bene?)
* **Service members** -- can we get this?
* **Caregivers and family**
