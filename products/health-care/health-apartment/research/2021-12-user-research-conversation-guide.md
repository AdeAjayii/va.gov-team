## Session setup

For this session, we may ask participants to share their screen in order to show us how they would interact with our homepage concept. The moderator should also be prepared to share her screen and show an authenticated My HealtheVet account for reference and participant feedback.

### Introduction (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is XXX and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experience with VA health care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* We want hear your personal experience and honest opinions. If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to know about it. Understanding your story will help us create better digital products for Veterans like you, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.

* Health can be a personal topic. I understand that there may be aspects about your health that you do not want to share with us. If you’d rather not answer a question, please just let me know and we can skip it.

* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. This is a voluntary session, and you will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? For this session, I will have you share your screen and ask you to show us how you manage benefits online, so this means that the information in your account would be part of the recording. Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of the people on this call. We use them only to confirm that we have captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them a few weeks after the session. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?

    *If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

    *I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

***Prior to showing concept (5-10 minutes)

To get started, I’d like to get a little background information about you, and your experience accessing healthcare through the VA website.

* What do you use this website for the most?
* What do you find the most valuable on this website?
* What do you wish this website did that it doesn’t do right now?
* Are there other patient portals you use? What do you like about them?

While showing concept (15-20 minutes)
Now I'm going to show you a new concept for the homepage, and when I do, I'd like you to give me your first impression of the design. 
*Things to watch and listen for: xxx

* To you, what are the most important items on this page?
* What items do you use most? (For each:) How often?
* If you could only have three tasks in the box on the left, what would they be?
* What information or actions would you like to see in (Medical, Finance, Information)?
* What information do you expect to see after clicking on (Health Supplies, Pharmacy, Medical Records) 
* What does the word Health Supplies mean to you? After participant answers, tell them what it is, then ask if there is a better name for "health supplies."



    

Thank you and closing (2 minutes)

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
