# Research Plan for the MyHealtheVet landing page, January 2022

## Goals
The intent of the homepage is to be a centralized hub for veterans to manage their healthcare.

In terms of the Veteran, the goal of this research is this: “I can get what I need related to health.” 

From our team’s perspective, we are testing the IA of the site. We want to ensure the landing page has clear paths to key information in the site since we are bringing My HealtheVet, the VA.gov Health care hub, and other health content under one “roof.”

* At this point, we are not working on user flows. We are testing the findability of key health tasks and info from the My HealtheVet authenticated landing page. 

### Background
This project maintains the vision of the Digital Modernization Strategy set in 2017: to provide a single, high-quality digital version of every health product or tool, plus the ability for a Veteran to see all of their health-related VA benefits in one place on VA.gov.

This study will build off of the results of our [informal user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-guerilla-test-12-2021/2021-12-guerilla-research-report.pdf), conducted in December 2021. 

### Research questions
This study focuses on 2 main areas:
* **Critical tasks:** Can veterans find key tasks and information when prompted?
* **Content balance:** Do Veterans go to content pages (instructional, policies, etc.) expecting to be able to perform a task?

### Hypotheses
For each question above, respectively, we believe the following:
* When given a task, Veterans will be able to find the corresponding action link that enables them to initiate that task. 
* When given a task, a Veteran won't click on a content page to initiate that task.

## Method
We will ask Veterans what health tasks they do and what health tasks they do online. When we do this we will:
1. Write down their tasks
2. Have them show us how they do the simplest task
3. Ask them to do two of their tasks on the concept for the My HealtheVet authenticated landing page 
4. Ask them to do several tasks to ensure that the landing page has clear paths to key information in the site.

For testing the mobile concept, we'll use Zoom and staging on VA.gov

Here is the [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/research/2021/homepage-formal-research-12-2021/Conversation-guide.md).

## Location
We'll conduct user research remotely online using the account associated with Perigean

## Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research is Veterans. We are planning to recruit through Perigean. 

## Recruitment criteria

### Familiarity with My HealtheVet 
Ideally get at least 2 participants from each:

* Signed in to MHV in the past 6 months
* Signed in to VA.gov in the past 6 months
* Never signed in to MHV or VA.gov

### Note:

* Some Veterans don’t differentiate between MHV and VA.gov. Some call MHV “the VA’s website” and don’t know about VA.gov.
* Veterans with VA health care typically go straight to MHV; however, they don’t always realize they are on VA.gov after following a link for something like “schedule an appointment.”

### Number of years with the VA/eras of service
Ideally get at least 1 participant from each:

* Left the military within the last 3 years
* Served in Operation Enduring Freedom or the Iraq War
* Served in the Gulf War
* Served in the Vietnam War

### Use of VA benefit 
Ideally get at least 1 participant from each:

* Uses VA health care only, or health care + disability compensation — but no other benefit types (e.g., housing, education)
* Uses health care + other VA benefit type(s)

### Secondary recruitment criteria we will strive to meet:

* Gender: At least 1/4 women
* Inclusion: At least 1/4 people of color
* Geography: Participants from East Coast, West Coast, and the Midwest
* Disability: At least three participants who use DAT

**What we expect to learn:**
* Veterans who use My HealtheVet will help us understand if the new layout of the tasks they're accustomed to doing in MHV are as easy as they're used to, if not easier.
* Veterans who do not use the My HealtheVet website will help us understand if the health apartment homepage is easy to use for people who do not use My HealtheVet.
