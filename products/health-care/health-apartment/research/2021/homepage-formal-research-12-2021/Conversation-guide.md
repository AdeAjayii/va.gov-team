# Conversation guide for user research on health apartment homepage concept






## Session setup

For this study, we'll send the participant a link to the design, and have them share their screen as they're interacting with it. 




### Introduction (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is *(insert name).* I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to show you a concept for putting all your VA health care needs online in one place. We'll show you the homepage, and ask you to complete a set of tasks. 




Before we start, a few things:




* This session should take about 30 minutes. I don't want to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.




* We want your honest opinions. We are focusing on making your experience the best it can be. Understanding your thoughts will help us create better digital products for Veterans like you, and we will not be offended by any opinions.




* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.




* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

    * Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of our team. We use them only to confirm that we've captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them after 2 weeks. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?




    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are OK with me recording this session once more.




Start recording.




* I've started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?




## Prior to showing concept (7 minutes)

* Please use these questions as a guide, not necessarily a script. The goal is to find out what's important to the user and if it's reflected in the design. If you see an opportunity for an important follow up question, take it. 




### Understand what they use 

* Do you use the web for your VA health care benefits?

* (if yes or no, ask:) When you manage your VA health care, what are examples of things you do regularly (*facilitator makes notes of these tasks*)


* Do you do those things online?

* (*facilitator asks about simplest task*) Show me where you go to do (task)




## Homepage(40 minutes)

* Show the participant the authenticated landing page concept, and ask them to do two of the tasks they mentioned above. If the participant did not mention any tasks, then use the task list below. 

### Task Questions 


### Appointments:
* Your doctor said they wanted to see you back in three months. How would you schedule that appointment?

### Pharmacy:
* You noticed you only have a few days left of a medication. How would you go about ordering more?

### Messages:
* Your doctor asked you last week to let them know how you were feeling on your new medication. How would you do that?

### Medical Records:
* You had some blood tests done at the VA this week, and you want to see those results. How would you find them?

### Health Care Benefits:
* If you drive to your primary care appointment at the VA, how would you go about getting reimbursed for gas?
* You need to see a podiatrist, but live 110 miles away from the closest VA podiatrist. You want to find out whether you're eligible to see a non-VA podiatrist.
* You need to go to the dentist. How would you find out what coverage you qualify for?













## End questions




* For moderator: Check Slack for follow-up questions from other observers.




* Do you have any questions for us? 




## Thank you and closing (2 minutes)

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on the VA website and make sure it really works for Veterans. With that, this concludes our test. Thank you and enjoy the rest of your day!
