# Conversation guide for user research on health apartment homepage concept






## Session setup

For this study, we'll send the participant a link to the design, and have them share their screen as they're interacting with it. 




### Introduction (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is *(insert name).* I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to show you a concept for putting all your VA health care needs online in one place. We'll show you the homepage, and ask you to complete a set of tasks. 




Before we start, a few things:




* This session should take about 30 minutes. I don't want to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.




* We want your honest opinions. We are focusing on making your experience the best it can be. Understanding your thoughts will help us create better digital products for Veterans like you, and we will not be offended by any opinions.




* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.




* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

    * Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of our team. We use them only to confirm that we've captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them after 2 weeks. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?




    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are OK with me recording this session once more.




Start recording.




* I've started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?




## Prior to showing concept (5-7 minutes)

* Please use these questions as a guide, not necessarily a script. The goal is to find out what's important to the user and if it's reflected in the design. If you see an opportunity for an important follow up question, take it. 




### Understand what they use 

* Do you use My HealtheVet?

* Do you use VA.gov for your health care?

> Listen for: 

* which site they use

* their process to get to My HealtheVet, VA.gov, or another website

* what they do on the site
