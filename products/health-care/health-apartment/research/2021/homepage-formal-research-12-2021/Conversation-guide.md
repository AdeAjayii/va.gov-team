# Conversation guide for user research on health apartment homepage concept






## Session setup

For this session, the moderator will share their screen so the participant can view the health homepage without having to click a link or open a file. 




### Introduction (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is *(insert name).* I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to show you a concept for putting all your VA health care needs online in one place. We'll show you the homepage.




Before we start, a few things:




* This session should take about 30 minutes. I don't want to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.




* We want your honest opinions. We are focusing on making your experience the best it can be. Understanding your thoughts will help us create better digital products for Veterans like you, and we will not be offended by any opinions.




* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.




* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? 

    * Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of our team. We use them only to confirm that we've captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them after 2 weeks. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?




    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are OK with me recording this session once more.




Start recording.




* I've started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?




## Prior to showing concept (5-7 minutes)

* Please use these questions as a guide, not necessarily a script. The goal is to find out what's important to the user and if it's reflected in the design. If you see an opportunity for an important follow up question, take it. 




### Understand what they use 

* Do you use My HealtheVet?

* Do you use VA.gov for your health care?

> Listen for: 

* which site they use

* their process to get to My HealtheVet, VA.gov, or another website

* what they do on the site





### Understand what's important to Veterans who use My HealtheVet or VA.gov

Do not ask these questions to Veterans who don't use My HealtheVet or VA.gov.




When necessary, ask follow-up questions to get a deeper understanding or to clarify what the Veteran is saying.




*If they use My HealtheVet:*

* What do you use My HealtheVet for? 

* How often do you use My HealtheVet? 

* Are there things you would like to do on My HealtheVet but currently cannot? 

   * *(If yes, ask this for each thing:)* Why would you like to do that? 




*If they use VA.gov:*

* What health care things do you use VA.gov for? 

* How often do you use VA.gov? 

* Are there things you would like to do on VA.gov but currently cannot? 

   * *(If yes, ask this for each thing:)* Why would you like to do that? 




## While showing concept (15 minutes)

Ahead of the session, adjust the Mural in your browser window so that the design shows somewhat realistically. 




Now I'm going to show you a new concept for the My HealtheVet homepage. 




For moderator: 

* For mobile: [Use the mobile Mural](https://app.mural.co/xxxxx).

* For desktop: [Use the desktop Mural](https://app.mural.co/xxxxx).




Next:

1. Share your screen with the participant. Share ONLY the browser window. 

2. Confirm that they can see the page.




### First Impression

I'd like your first impression. Talk out loud. Say anything that comes to mind. And let me know when you would like me to scroll.

 Watch and listen for: 

* If they remark on something missing.

Ask the participant:

* Tell me about your first impressions. 

* Where is your attention drawn?

 

### Task Questions 
 *Now I'm going to ask you how you think you would perform certain tasks on the site. Remember, there's no wrong or right answer.*

* If you wanted to schedule a new appointment, what would you do?
