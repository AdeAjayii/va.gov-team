## Session setup

For this session, the moderator will send the participant a URL, and they will share their screen to show how they interact with our homepage design. 

### Introduction (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is XXX and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your your experience with VA healthcare and show you a concept for a redesigned health care page.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* We want hear your honest opinions. We're technologists focusing on making the user experience the best it can be. Understanding your thoughts will help us create better digital products for Veterans like you, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.


* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. This is a voluntary session, and you will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of the people on this call. We use them only to confirm that we have captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them 2 weeks after the session. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?

    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

    * I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Prior to showing concept (5-10 minutes)

To get started, I’d like to get a little background information about you, and your experience accessing healthcare through both VA.gov and MyHealtheVet. 

* What do you use this website for the most?
* What do you find the most valuable on this website?
* What do you wish this website did that it doesn’t do right now?
* Are there other patient portals you use? What do you like about them?

## While showing concept (15 minutes)
Now I'm going to show you a new concept for the homepage, and when I do, I'd like you to give me your first impression of the design. 
*Things to watch and listen for: Where they point their mouse to first, what they want to click on, if they remark on something missing.

* To you, what are the most important items on this page? Why?
* What items do you use most? For each: How often?
* What information or actions would you like to see in (Medical, Finance, Information)?
* What information do you expect to see after clicking on (Health Supplies, Pharmacy, Medical Records) 
* What does the word Health Supplies mean to you? After participant answers, tell them what it is, then ask if there is a better name for "health supplies."
* Is there anything missing on the page?

## End questions
* If you had a magic wand, what would you put on this page? How would it work for you? 
* I'm going to open the floor to my colleagues to ask any follow up questions they might have.

    

## Thank you and closing (2 minutes)


We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
