## Session setup
For this session, the moderator will share their screen so the participant can view the health homepage without having to click a link or open a file. 

### Introduction (2 minutes)
Thanks for joining us today! My name is *(insert name)* and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experience with VA health care and show you a concept for a health homepage.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

* We want hear your honest opinions. We're technologists focusing on making your experience the best it can be. Understanding your thoughts will help us create better digital products for Veterans like you, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.


* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. This is a voluntary session, and you will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? Just so you know, these recordings are not shared outside of the people on this call. We use them only to confirm that we have captured what you have said accurately, and then we delete them 2 weeks after the session. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?

    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Prior to showing concept (5-7 minutes)
* Please use these questions as a guide, not necessarily a script. The goal is to find out what's important to the user and if it's reflected in the design. If you see an opportunity for an important follow up question, take it. 

### Understand what they use 
* Tell me how you take care of your health care online.
> Listen for: 
> * which site they use
> * their process to get to My HealtheVet, VA.gov, or another website
> * what they do on the site
> * what "health care" means to them

* Do you cancel or adjust your appointments online?
* How do you refill your prescriptions?
* How do you communicate with your providers/doctors?
* Are there other patient portals, online systems, or apps you use to manage your health care? 
   * *(If yes:)* What do you like about them?

### Understand what's important to Veterans who use My HealtheVet or VA.gov
Do not ask these questions to Veterans who don't use My HealtheVet or VA.gov.

When necessary, ask follow-up questions to get a deeper understanding or to clarify what the Veteran is saying.

*If they use My HealtheVet:*
* What do you use My HealtheVet for? 
* How often do you use My HealtheVet? 
* Are there things you would like to do on My HealtheVet but currently cannot? 
   * *(If yes, ask this for each thing:)* Why would you like to do that? 

*If they use VA.gov:*
* What health care things do you use VA.gov for? 
* How often do you use VA.gov? 
* Are there things you would like to do on VA.gov but currently cannot? 
   * *(If yes, ask this for each thing:)* Why would you like to do that?
