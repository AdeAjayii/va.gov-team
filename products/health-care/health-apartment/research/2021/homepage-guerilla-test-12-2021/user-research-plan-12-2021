# Informal user research on health home page concepts

## Goals
The VA Health Apartment team is conducting user tesing of its homepage and sitemap concept to understand how a variety of veterans currently use MyHealtheVet, how our concept solves painpoints, and what information they care about the most. The feedback from this research will inform future iterations of both the homepage and sitemap, as well as the overall design of the apartment concept.

## Background
Xxxx

## Research questions
The questions for this study will be presented in two parts: before the user is shown the concept, and during. 
Pre-concept questions:
* Before showing concept:
* What do you use this website for the most?
* What do you find the most valuable on this website?
* What do you wish this website did that it doesn’t do right now?
* Are there other patient portals you use? What do you like about them?

Questions to be posed while showing the concept:
* What is your first impression of this design?
* What are the most important items you would like to see on the homepage?
* What are the most important items you would like to see in the Dashboard?
* What information or actions would you like to see in (Medical, Finance, Information)?
* What is the next page you would expect to see after clicking on (Health Supplies, Pharmacy, Medical Records, etc) 
* What does the word Health Supplies mean to you?

## Method
We'll use semi-structured interviews and observations for this study. This allows us to ask prepared questions to the user and document their behavior as they explore the homepage design, while also giving us the flexibility to pivot and ask follow-up questions should an interesting thread reveal itself. The in-depth qualitative information we'll glean as a result of the study will give us actionable insights as we iterate on our design concept. 

## Recruitment criteria

### Primary recruitment criteria: 

**Familiarity with My HealtheVet**
Ideally get at least 2 participants from each: 
* Signed in to MHV in the past 6 months
* Signed in to VA.gov in the past 6 months
* Never signed in to MHV or VA.gov

Note:
* Some Veterans don’t differentiate between MHV and VA.gov. Some call MHV “the VA’s website” and don’t know about VA.gov.
* Veterans with VA health care typically go straight to MHV; however, they don’t always realize they are on VA.gov after following a link for something like “schedule an appointment.” 

**Number of years with the VA/eras of service**
Ideally get at least 1 participant from each: 
* Left the military within the last 3 years
* Served in Operation Enduring Freedom or the Iraq War
* Served in the Gulf War
* Served in the Vietnam War

**Use of VA benefits**
Ideally get at least 1 participant from each: 
* Uses VA health care only, or health care + disability compensation — but no other benefit types (e.g., housing, education)
* Uses health care + other VA benefit type(s)

### Secondary recruitment criteria we will strive to meet:
* Gender: At least 1/4 women
* Inclusion: At least 1/4 people of color
* Geography: Participants from East Coast, West Coast, and the Midwest
