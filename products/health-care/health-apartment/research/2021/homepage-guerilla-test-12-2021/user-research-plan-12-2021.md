# Informal user research on health home page concepts

## Goals
The VA Health Apartment team is conducting user testing of its authenticated homepage and high-level sitemap concept to understand: 
* How a variety of Veterans currently use MyHealtheVet,
* How our concept solves pain points, and 
* What information Veterans care about most. 

The feedback from this research will inform future iterations of both the homepage and sitemap, as well as the overall design of the health apartment concept.

## Research questions
This study focuses on 3 main areas:
* **Critical tasks:** What are the critical actions a Veteran wants to see right away on the homepage?
* **Vital information:** What information do veterans need to see on the homepage after signing in (authenticated homepage)?
* **Content balance:** What's the right balance of content/information on the homepage, such that it doesn't overwhelm the user? How would they like that content and information presented?

## Hypotheses
For each question, respectively, we believe the following:
* Veterans want to see specific tasks, rather than information, surfaced immediately on the homepage. This fits with a recurring theme in previous research, that veterans are task-oriented
* Similar to the previous hypotheses, we believe veterans want to see actionable information upon signing in.
* A veteran wants content that is helpful to them and guides them to a task or resource without swimming in text. The less text that isn't interactive  or pertinent, the better. 

## Method
We'll use semi-structured interviews and observations for this study. This allows us to ask prepared questions to the user and document their behavior as they explore the homepage design, while also giving us the flexibility to pivot and ask follow-up questions should an interesting thread reveal itself. The in-depth qualitative information we'll glean as a result of the study will give us actionable insights as we iterate on our design concept.

## Location
We'll conduct the tests on Zoom.

## Recruitment approach
We are planning to conduct guerilla research, meaning we will identify veterans in our social networks and coordinate with them to set up research sessions on Zoom. We will do this on a rolling basis, talking to as many participants as we can from December 10 to the 13th. 

## Recruitment criteria

We will test the authenticated mobile and web homepage concepts with veterans who use MyHealtheVet to manage their healthcare. 

## When?

Length of session: 30 minute sessions with 15 minutes between sessions

Moderator availability: 7AM - 9PM ET December 10-13, 2021.

Draft of conversation guide complete: December 3rd
