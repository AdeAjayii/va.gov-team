### Discussion Notes
Here's the [presentation the team gave during the workshop](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/health-apartment/product/working-group/10-27-2021-Kickoff/VA%20TAC_MO%20Studio_VFS-DHM_Working%20Group%20Pre-Read_20211025.pptx).
- The prior OCTO-OCC leadership workshops identified and prioritized several project areas. This team is executing on the Health Apartment project specifically and will be working collaboratively with other teams as we deliver, starting with a proof of concept. 
- We discussed the opportunity around appointments and the hypothesis that if we can make a single, more fully featured, appointment tool delivered in a way that isn’t disruptive to MHV users, it could show a way to merge VAOS functionality with the MHV experience that Veterans are familiar with. This will help us learn more about solving the bigger challenge of integrating health tools in a way that’s not disruptive to the current users. We plan to use prototyping and research stimuli to test and learn about the user needs and technical and business requirements.
- There are a lot of lessons to share from the flagship mobile app team including IA research and collaboration and we’ll follow up to learn more and build off what’s working well. 
- We are going to be intentional about designing with Veterans and SMEs and we discussed how this project touches a lot of different teams and in-flight projects. This working group will help ensure close collaboration.
- The group talked about getting the right expertise from OCC engaged at the right times and investigating options to join the core team other than as just observers or full time. We want to strike the right balance here.
