**Overarching Theme**
We are heavily guided by the Veteran experience. We want to create the best Veteran experience for healthcare 

# Agenda:
**Welcome & Introductions** [1] ………………………………………………   2:00 pm |  Jeff Scheire? 

First, introduce our core team. Next acknowledge our other partners including, Pluribus, Frog, and other partners and recognize that they bring a wealth of technology and change expertise to the team. We look forward to co-creating with you and utilizing these extended teams as a resource throughout the engagement. Avoid specific name dropping. 

**What We’ll Cover Today** [2] .…………………………………………………   2:05 pm |  Meg Peters?

Express your excitement, recognize and celebrate our commitment to the project. Next, describe what collaboration with us will look and feel like.  Emphasize our purpose: Collectively, we’re embarking on a journey to drastically improve healthcare for millions of Veterans. Clearly it’s not only the right time for this project but we most certainly have the right people. Thank you for your curiosity, courage and commitment. Finally, review the agenda: what we’re currently working on, where we’re headed, how we think our work builds off and impacts your work, areas where we need help, and finally, what follow up meetings are needed.  

**Where We’re At & Where We’re Headed** [3-9] …………………………… 2:10 pm |  Working team + Meg/Lauren?

Highlight roadmap with epics and an overlap with other teams’s roadmap. Identify dependencies and intersections of work and where we need help. 


Where We’re At [3-5]: Incorporate existing assets, slides from monthly report, etc. | Working team?
* Highlighting introductions we’ve made
* Original (not wireframe) envisioned visual - can be bridge between this and next section

        
Where We’re Headed [6-8]: Incorporate existing assets, wireframes, roadmap | Working team?
* POC approach
* Proposed information architecture
* Testing with tree test with diverse populations including Veterans and caregivers
* Continue to do technical discovery
* Building the team

Where We Need Help [9]: Specific slide with call outs or integrate into where we’re headed? | Meg, Lauren?
* Continue to collaborate across silos
* Engagement in working group
* Sharing of roadmaps
* Visibility to things like prototyping, authentication experience
* Not duplication efforts, visibility into organization 


**Initial Thoughts & Feedback**  [10] ………………….……………………… 2:40 pm |  Paula?

Acknowledge your appreciation for their investment and emphasize again our commitment to collaboration and continuing the conversation. Share the link for the digital survey, acknowledge the time remaining, and open the floor to comments and feedback. See survey questions below:


**Closing Remarks**  [11] ………………….……………………...……………… 2:55 pm |  Meg or Lauren?

Thank the audience for their attention and encourage them to complete the digital survey (create a slack channel and invite everyone in attendee list - would allow to run survey in slack).


# Survey Questions:

* What questions do you have?
* Is this a good time slot for this session? 
* What changes would you like to see to this format? 
* Since this session will be a regular series, please recommend ways to bring people into the discussion at relevant touch points (alignment, technical challenges, etc.)?

# NOTES

# Open Items:
1. Should we create a slack channel for the working group or add them to our cedar-health-apartment channel?
2. Should we create the survey in slack or one in another format (if another format, what's accessible for VA employees?)?

NOTES: 10.14 Last Mtg. w/ Paula, Lara, & Lauren
What we’ve heard:
Make this session relevant for the most number of attendees.
Use time to acknowledge importance of this, add value, reason why we’re here. This is us sharing out plus co-creating together.
A tactical activity for this big of an audience for our first session might be “too much,” but how might we break the ice and infuse energy?
The person sharing out the work itself should be someone close to the work (i.e., Meg, Lara, Paula, Jared, Nadya).
Call out dependencies and where the intersections in our work are.

Materials:
Slides 
Simple wireframe with notations / text
Post-session survey

Objective:
Introduce our team and share what collaboration with us will look and feel like.
Share what we’re doing, where we’re going, and how our work builds off and impacts their work. 
Acknowledge we’re working with related teams (XYZ).
Raise areas in which we need help (identify what follow up meetings are needed). 

Agenda:
Introductions
Share objective and agenda; set tone for Working Group
Share work to date and what’s next (roadmap with epics with versions overlapped with other teams’s roadmap)
Ask specific questions, collect feedback, etc.
What to expect from collaborating with us (e.g., partners with X expertise and will be tapped in as resources and reachback)
Thank you and tee up post-session survey for feedback* 

---
10/24 Notes:
*Feedback on how the session went; does this time work for you; thoughts on future WG structure; what would you like to see and/or discuss during WG
Look at WG as a series and how we can bring in certain folks at relevant touchpoints (alignment, technical challenges)
Reachback and tapping into resources can land well with WG
Whenever we introduce Marcy, we need to be very clear about her role 
Decentralized < centralized à la Mobile Sync (informing folks of progress, raising areas for follow ups)
Targeted, scoped areas for engagement
Bring their voice in and carry their thoughts through the series
