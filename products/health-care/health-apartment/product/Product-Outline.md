# Health Apartment Product Outline


---

## Overview
The Health Apartment Team’s mission is to simplify Veterans’ health experience on the web by consolidating all health things into a single health “home” on VA.gov, which we have nicknamed the “health apartment.”

## Problem Statement
To get the health care they need, Veterans must find, register for, and learn to use a number of different websites and software products. Our generative research from late 2020 shows that Veterans find it extremely difficult to navigate commonplace interactions with VA health care. The VA ecosystem is so complex that Veterans feel discouraged to apply for, manage, and maximize their benefits.
* How might we build a "one-stop'shop" for veterans to manage their health care?
* How might we build a task-oriented site to complement veterans' task-oriented nature?
* How might we surface critical tasks for a veteran to immediatealy and easily action?
* How might we personalize the apartment so the veteran truly feels it belongs to them?


 
## Desired User Outcomes
As a Veteran, I:
- Can manage my health care without having to navigate to different sites within the VA network
- Can easily access, initiate, and complete tasks that are critical to managing my health care 
- Can quickly find information about my benefits 
- Know when an item needs action, and  can take said action with minimal steps



## Desired Business Outcomes
- Increased satisfaction with VA digital experience
- Increased quality and consistency of care

## Measuring success 

-	The proportion of Veterans using VA.gov OR MHV monthly does not decrease.
-	The proportion of Veterans using VA.gov AND MHV monthly decreases.
-	Within 6 months of moving into the apartment, each product that moved: 
	- Scores higher on [accessibility index]
	- Has the same or more monthly active users
	- Causes the same or less contact center support volume per user
	- Has the same or lower story cycle time
- Review MHV metrics and implement and track the same on va.gov in order to compare the flows and set benchmarks.
- Define happy and/or critical path tasks and measure:
	- steps to get to path from va.gov
	- daily active users
	- drop off points
	- started vs completed tasks
	- time to complete task
- Number of searches for content definied in the health space
- Performance of the site (number of timeouts, outages, down time)
- Authenticated vs Unauthentiated actions
- Number of veterans who successfully sign up for health benefits on va.gov

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)

- Objective/Job to be Done: As a Veteran, I want a single platform that empowers me to manage my health care and complete the tasks necessary to do so with minimal complexity and navigation.
  - Key result: Gather essential requirements for each "feature" from necessary teams
  - Key result: User-test prototypes with 12 Veterans
  - Key result: Construct holistic POC to circulate to VA stakeholders

## Assumptions and Risks
-	Although MO Studio continues to hire and ramp up staff, a full team with required skillsets have not started on the project.
-	Federal team needs an OCTO engineer + staff from OCC / My HealtheVet (skills needed from OCC are TBD). 
-	There are a lot of stakeholders within OCTO and OCC who require buy in, with a lot of things in flight, there is room for error if the checkins and sign offs aren't scheduled well in advance. 
-	Without significant research and testing, the project could further fragment the UX before simplifying it.
-	Without a tech lead and immense knowledge of VA's tech restraints and APIs, there are a lot of challenges and setbacks that could arise. 
-	Outliers within Cerner and Community Care. If APIs aren't accessible for the MVP, the experience in the health apartment will be as fragmented as the experience is now: "If you're a patient at X Cerner facility, go through this 'door' (in the health apartment) to manage your health experience at X Cerner facility."


## Solution Approach

- We are in the process of building a POC that contains a low-fidelity mock-up of the following pages: Homepage, Messages, Pharmacy, Medical Records, Health Care, Disability, and Resources
- The POC will not have any functionality, as the purpose is to gain buy in from various groups within the VA.
- Once buy-in is secured, we'll begin building the MVP


## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*
