Welcome to the Health Apartment team! We're excited to have you join this program as we work to simplify and unify the Veteran health experience into a single front door by bringing all things health, including My HealtheVet, into VA.gov. Through our work together, we will create an accessible, usable, and discoverable health “home."


As you onboard to the program, we've collected a few resources for you to review asynchronously and will be scheduling key meetings as outlined below.


# Onboarding meetings
1. **Program Introduction.** Meet with the MO Studio Program Manager to learn about the team, program, and current work. The Program Manager will share with you our Monthly Project Management deck which is the source of truth for the program and includes our sprint plans and demo materials.  
2. **Product Introduction.** Meet with the MO Studio Product Manager and VA Product Owner to understand the product vision and ecosystem. During this session, you'll review the product outline and deep dive into the current development status. 
3. **Team and VA Leadership Introductions.** The MO Studio Product Manager will schedule 1:1 meetings with you and team members to get to know each other and with VA leadership as appropriate. 
4. **Charter.** The MO Studio Scrum Master will schedule team charter sessions as the team grows and evolves. We look forward to including your input as you join the team! 
5. **Tools Onboarding and Q&A.** The program manager will provide access to the tools to get you started on the program, but we realize some of them may be new to you. In this session, you'll meet with a project team member for Q&A on any tools. 
6. **MO Studio Product Delivery Framework and CEDAR Overview.** A MO Studio leader will meet with you to review our product delivery framework and our team's submission for the CEDAR IDIQ which guide our work on the program.

# Materials to review asynchronously
1. [Apartment Onboarding Guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/onboarding.md) The Digital Health Modernization team (Meg Peters, Emily Mann, Aryeh Jacobsohn) was the precursor to the Health Apartment team. This onboarding guide outlines their work that led to this program, the vision, and links to additional resources to review.
2. [Health Apartment Team GitHub Repo.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/health-apartment) We work in the open and share our materials in a GitHub repo. This is where you'll find our team's history of deliverables and our latest work. The broader VA GitHub includes additional great information across products, processes, and projects at the VA. Spend some time exploring the other folders to learn more. Note that the Apartment folder structure here follows the OCTO IA guidelines and is mirrored in our mural room. 
3. [Health Apartment Team Mural Room.](https://app.mural.co/t/innovationboards1199/r/1631551671896) We're a collaborative team and use Mural to co-create and plan our work. You may find it useful to browse through the most recent murals. Note that there is a template for creating new murals which uses our standard heading. 
4. [Platform Tools List.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/Platform-tools.1872855066.html) After onboarding to the contract, you'll need access to collaboration, project management, and functional specific tools. The Program Manager will request access for you to join Slack, GitHub, and ZenHub. For additional tools related to your functional area, please see this list that the Platform team has created of the key tools within the Digital Services @ VA ecosystem and how to access them.
