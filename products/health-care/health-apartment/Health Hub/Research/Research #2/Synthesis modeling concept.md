2. Transcription
3. Coding and tagging
4. Affinity diagrams
5. Patterns and trends
6. Writing actionable recommendations and insights

**Potential global tags**  
  


- **Goal**: What the person is trying to accomplish as an outcome.
- **Need**: Something a person needs to fulfill a goal.
- **Motivation**: Why the person is trying to achieve that goal.
- **Task**: Something a person does to achieve a goal.
- **Pain point**: A barrier or difficulty towards accomplishing a goal.
- **Tools**: A tool a person uses to try to accomplish a goal.

**Example**: In our current research we are researching the Tree for [VA.gov](http://va.gov/) Health Care website and so far I’ve heard several statements such as:

 “Wasn’t hard, but wasn’t easy, because we have vets who aren’t good on computers.”

- **Pain Point** - as it can adversely affect Vets in different age or computer savvy abilities “That wasn’t much fun, that’s way too much clicking.** **

- **Pain Point** - some frustration with the search process; “MYHealth is talking about ME, benefits I’ve used. I want shortcuts to MY dental & Refill prescriptions”

- **Goal** - as this person states they want a place for ME in MyHealth & shortcuts perhaps.
