Subject: Participate in research with VA

Hello,

The Department of Veterans Affairs is conducting research to learn how you get and manage health benefits offered by the VA
We are looking for Veterans who are interested in participating in an online activity to help us understand your preferences.

*What will I be doing in this activity?*
You will be sent a link to an online activity in which you'll see a list of VA-related tasks. You will be asked to find a certain item and presented with a list of links. Click through the list until you arrive at one that you think helps you complete the task. If you take a wrong turn, you can go back by clicking one of the links above.
There are no wrong answers. We would like to learn how you travel through the categories to complete the task.

*How long is the activity?*
The activity is self guided and should take you 15-20 minutes to complete on a computer (please don't use a phone or tablet because the screen will be too small). You can do this at any time that's convenient for you.

*Interested in participating?*
Please reply to this email to receive the activity link and a participation code.
