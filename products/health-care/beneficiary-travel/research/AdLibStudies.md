**Takeaway:** In the [post login-comments doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/8a5ebeccab14ac3cc37b70592396d30990638458/products/identity/Research/2023-02%20Desk%20Research/VA%20login%20post%20comments.md), two people talked about travel pay issues

> I hope the new VA director will do things for the benefit of all of us Veterans. Many things at the VA are more fitted to provide jobs for the staff than for the benefit of the Veterans. I have tried to question the performance of the travel personnel to have them spitefully hold my travel pay for nearly a month, thus far. The “in manual review “ is used to delay our payment, which the BTSSS is supposed to facilitate…!

> Trying to get travel pay is now a nightmare. What was wrong with the old simple system? How many old veterans don’t have computers or smart phones?

### Study name: Profile multi-feature UAT and generative research
**Team/Researcher:** Authenticated Experience, Liz Lantz

**Date:** October 2023

**Link to study:** [Findings summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2023-10-UAT-edit-as-subtask-default-send-checkbox-ui/findings-summary.md#travel-pay-painpoint)

**Takeaway:** One participant shared frustration that they’ve never been able to successfully use BTSSS to submit a claim for travel pay, and had missed out on $350 to date. They felt the site had a bug, and had attempted to call the MHV help line, and get help in person at their VAMC with no luck.
