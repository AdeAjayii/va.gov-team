# Team Development Processes

## Refinement and/or Planning
- For an Epic
    - Questions to answer
        - Will we use a FF or a FB?
        - Is this in the Planned Releases list yet?
        - Can we release this sprint?
    - Pick a release date that is at least 1 week in advance
    - Coordinate the release with UX & Product
- For a bug or tech debt
    - Let everyone know in the release channel when it gets merged
 
 ## Releasing
- Validation
    - TBD.....
- Epics 
    - Will appear on the Planned Release list as soon as it enters our Product Backlog
    - Will have pre-release notes that eventually become the release notes
    - Get a TBD release date or range until we are fairly certain we know when we are going to release
    - Will have their release coordinated with UX & Product
- Tech debt
    - Will not appear on the Planned Releases
    - Gets release notes when we release, which is up to the developer
    - Developer puts in the release slack channel that something is getting released and on what date
- Bugs 
    - Will not appear on the Planned Releases
    - Gets release notes when we release, which is up to the developer
    - Developer puts in the release slack channel that something is getting released and on what date
