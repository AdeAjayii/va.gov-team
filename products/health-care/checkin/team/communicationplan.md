<h1>Team Communication Plan- Chick'n Eggsperience</h1>

Work Items- go in zenhub/github tickets. 
<ul><li>For Epics, create a problem statement.</li>
<li>For other work item tickets, user story and acceptance criteria are important- other background information or notes, and tasks as needed are helpful.</li></ul> 

Updates to work items- sometimes conversations go on in Slack about work items- please try to remember to copy relevant topics to the corresponding user stories.
Screenshot or link to slack thread if possible.

Project documentation
<ul><li>Post to github as a centralized location</li>
  <li>Use decision register for important decisions/when we think we need it</li>
  <li>What was the decision, who was there, why?</li>
  <li>Design documents and output of spike tickets</li></ul>

Collaboration w/team members
<ul><li>Slack first, zoom for meetings, google docs for WIP, Mural for working sessions</li>
  <li>Code spaces (Github) for paired programming</li>
  <li>If slack threads go to zoom calls, be sure to add notes on slack about outcomes/next steps</li>
<li>Consider recording meetings if it could be useful for someone else. Be cognizant of rules when recording w/staff or veterans</li></ul>

Communication with other teams
<ul><li>Keep it to public channels in slack as much as possible to remove dependencies on individuals</li>
<li>When possible, use pre-established meeting times for cross-team sharing</li>
<li>When meeting with other teams about a specific ticket, add notes/comments to the ticket about who you met with and what it was about</li>
  <li>Link resources in slack or github ticket</li>
<li>Email is ok, but secondary to slack. For emails related to work items, copy/paste relevant info (remove email addresses, and be mindful that our board is public.)</li></ul>

* Slack = DSVA slack
