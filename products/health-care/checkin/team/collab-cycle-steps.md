# PLATFORM COLLABORATION CYCLE STEPS

**Guidelines for folllowing these steps:**

- For content changes, we may choose to bypass these steps but still reach out to and collaborate with the sitewide team to get their feedback
- For design changes, we may choose to bypass these steps but still reach out to and collaborate with the design team to get their feedback
- We may choose to follow these steps but not necessarily need every step; we will explain in the ticket why we do not need a step when this is the case
- If requested artifacts are not available or relevant, we will explain that in the ticket
