# How should we test the VA-owned device concept?

## Research questions
- ~~Do a subset of Veterans find our VA-owned device solution interesting and something that they would use to check-in?~~ Note: We know this from previous work.
- What is the minimum that needs to change in the current mobile experience for this new modality?
  - Does MVP need to include VHIC card scanning?
  - Do we need to make touch target (button size) changes?
  - Do we need to make any workflow order changes?
- Does the proposed identity verfication method match Veteran expectations?
- Implications to hardware and software.

## Decisions to be made before we can run a research study
1. Location
  - **On-site**
  - Remote
2. Scope (Bold signifies that it is part of MVP)
  - **Change the screen size only (responsive)**
  - **Identity verification
  - **Auto logout**
  - **Remove header/footer**
  - **Provide an easy way to quit**
  - **Visual impairment - using built-in iOS capabilities and best software development practices**
  - VHIC card scanning
  - Visual design (touch targets, font sizes, etc)
  - Editing contact information, next of kin, and emergency contact capabilities
3. Type of prototype
  - **Hi-fi Sketch or UX Pin prototype**
  - Coded prototype
  - Paper or low-fi prototype (allows more focus on the workflow order)
4. Device
  - **Tablet**
  - Computer

### Things to take into account on-site
- Computer or tablet set up for us in the waiting room. Or take something with us? How can we get a machine to test on?
- We need to find a site that has good connections (wifi) or we need a testing location close to a waiting room that we can hard-wire in.
- Veteran might not be will to try a UXPin prototype on site, since they would still have to check-in. Maybe we recruit Veterans after they checked in or Veterans who are done with their appointment.

## Outstanding questions
- Should any research questions be added?
- What are the final decisions on decision 1 - 4 (specifically decision 2)?
- What identity verfication method do we need to use? Do we need full SSN or add phone? What three pieces of data fit security requirements?
- Are there any changes needed to the staff-facing app (staff notifications, such as when check-in started is triggered)?
- Should we talk to staff who are part of purchasing equipment? Who would buy this? - Answer: Not at this time for this research study.
