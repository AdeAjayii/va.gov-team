# How should we test the VA-owned device concept?

## Research questions
- Do a subset of Veterans find our VA-owned device solution interesting and something that they would use to check-in?
- What is the minimum that needs to change in the current mobile experience for this new modality?
  - Does MVP need to include VHIC card scanning?
  - Do we need to make touch target (button size) changes?
  - Do we need to make any workflow order changes?
- Does the proposed identity verfication method match Veteran expectations?

## Decisions to be made before we can run a research study
1. Location
  - **On-site (Recommended, because the physical environment has such an impact on this experience)**
  - Remote
2. Scope
  - Change the screen size only (responsive)
  - Change the screen size only (responsive) plus identity verification
  - **Change the screen size only (responsive), identity verification, header/footer (Recommended due to previous team discussion)**
  - Change the screen size only (responsive), identity verification, header/footer, VHIC card scanning, and visual design (touch targets, font sizes, etc)
  - Eveything listed above plus editing capabilities
3. Type of prototype
  - **Hi-fi Sketch or UX Pin prototype (Recommended due to types of research questions that we have)**
  - Coded prototype
  - Paper or low-fi prototype (allows more focus on the workflow order)
4. Device
  - Tablet
  - Computer

### Things to take into account on-site
- Computer or tablet set up for us in the waiting room. Or take something with us? How can we get a machine to test on?
- We need to find a site that has good connections (wifi) or we need a testing location close to a waiting room that we can hard-wire in.
- Veteran might not be will to try a UXPin prototype on site, since they would still have to check-in. Maybe we recruit Veterans after they checked in or Veterans who are done with their appointment.

## Outstanding questions
- Should any research questions be added?
- What are the final decisions on decision 1 - 4 (specifically decision 2)?
- What identity verfication method do we need to use? Do we need full SSN or add phone? What three pieces of data fit security requirements?
