## Notes:
- Acronyms related to video appointments
    - VA Video Service (VVS) is the VVC database
    - Virtual Care Manager (VCM) is the staff-facing application
    - Virtual Medical Room (VMR)

- Business Needs with Respect to Video Appointments:  
    - No ability to know if a patient has confirmed their VVC appt (i.e. indicates they're intending on showing up). 
    - Minimal to zero demographics or insurance review.
    - Action required issues; don't know if Dr. saw the patient

- Video Appointments:
	- Might be beneficial to do Pre-Check-in, but we would need to coordinate
	- There are a lot of notifications that the VVC software sends out 
		○ When it is scheduled in VCM
		○ 7, 3, 1 day before

- Telephone Appointments
  - May be able to have support for telehphone in eCheck-in after we do the 45-minute reminder
	  - Don't kick out if demographics is wrong
	  - List all of the business logic to see what is applicable & what is not
