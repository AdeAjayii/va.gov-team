# Notes from Interview with VA PCP Clinic on Telephone Appointments

## Background: 

- How many providers make up the Family Medicine practice at ... ?     
  - 14 providers (I think) in primary care. Mix of physicians and mid-levels. 
  - Most are PAC providers, who all do telephone appointments. 
  - Roughly 80 teams

- Do you see patients at any other locations?
  - Always see patients here. 

- Do all providers within the Family Medicine practice at FVAMC accept telephone appointments? 
  - n/a 

## Current telephone appointment workflow: 

- How do patients currently schedule telephone appointments? (In person, over the phone, etc.) When does it typically take place? E.g., before or after an appointment. And, what information is collected from patients? 
  - There are two ways that Veterans can schedule a phone appointment. 1) They call in and choose their modality, or 2) the provider may schedule their next appointment at the conclusion of their visit. 

- Is there any information that you’d like collected that currently isn’t? (And, how might that information be used?)  
  - I don't think any extra information is collected from the patient that isn't already known. Like with all appointments, they may be asked to update their insurance. 
  - They work off an RTC (return to clinic order) that a provider placed for a future appointment and work from a specified date range. 
  - Depending on the specific PAC team, the patient might be contacted for something else for an acute need. 
  - There should be at least two numbers, but it's confusing. A main number and a cell. That information should be in CPRS. One thing that would be an improvement is if the phone number would be more obvsiou that I have to call. 
  - In the EMR, there is a button to click for demographics. There is a space for main number and cell. I don't know what to call first. Sometimes I have to call both. 

- Are all patients (e.g., new vs. returning), appointment types (e.g., screening, follow up, etc.) and reasons for their visit all able to schedule a telephone appointment (vs. in-person)? What are some of those patient eligibility requirements to schedule a telephone appointment? 
  - For new patients, usually they aren't seen for a phone appointment, but during COVID we have had to do phone. It is something diffferent than normal times. It was done out of necessity. 
  - Technically, they can always choose a telephone appointment for a follow-up visit. Can't schedule a telephone appointment with a nurse. The nurse would reach out to them and schedule that. 

- Are appointment reminders or any pre-registration sent to patients before a scheduled telephone appointment? If so, what information is typically in those communications and how are they delivered to patients? E.g., VeText, phone calls, emails, etc. 
  - VEText isn't consistent. You have to already had been signed up. 
  - I'm a Veteran myself and I'm trying to think about what I receive. I just got a VEText and it says that I have an appointment on this date and to confirm. I think it is tied to me signing up for MHV. I think texting is way more effective these days than calling. I had an eye appointment at a community facility. I get calls all day long and I can't answer them because I'm seeing patients. At some facilities, if I don't answer or reply, they'll mark me as non-compliant. 
  - Texting is way more effective than calling these days. 

- What typically happens immediately before a scheduled telephone appointment? For example, does the provider call the patient directly at the time of the appointment? Are there multiple phone numbers to try if the patient doesn’t pick up? 
  - Different sites do it differently. There is no uniform way to prep for an appointment. Part of our team, called an MSA, would call them the day before or a week before. They do a reminder that you have an appointment in the clinic or on the phone, just as an FYI. Sometimes the LPN will call the day before to remind them and go through questions, such as, "Do you smoke?" or "Are you depressed?" It is to mimic what happens in the clinic. We can't do that unless the LPN calls the day before to ask those questions. 
  - Ask them "reminders" which are health information questions. 

- Besides the provider, are any other administrative or clinical staff involved during a scheduled telephone appointment? 
  - n/a 

## Current telephone appointment feedback: 

- Are there any common logistical problems the day of a scheduled phone appointment? E.g., wrong phone number, patient didn’t answer, patient is late, etc. 
  - Worse due to COVID. Some patients aren't aware that they have a telemedicine appointment. THen, they show up at the office for a telemedicine appointment. 
  - Some patients struggle with where to find out information about their call. If they call the office, it is hard to get that information. Sometimes they send a secure message to the provider, but not all patients have that. 
  - If they get a postcard in the mail, then it just says that they have an appointment at this time. It doesn't say the modality. It causes confusion on the day of the appointment. 

- What steps, solutions or ideas, if any, do you think could help improve or fix those types of problems? 
  - n/a 

## Future state: 

- Any thoughts (e.g., advantages or disadvantages) about a scenario where scheduled telephone appointments are connected with a patient mobile pre-registration or mobile day-of, check-in solution (that confirms patient contact information or notifies the provider the patient is ready for their appointment)? 
  - There is already something that automatically calls you to tell you that you have an appointment tomorrow. (This is Audiocare.) It used to happen regularly. 
  - At a minimum, it would be helpful for someone to call the patient a few days before to remind the patient that you have a telemedicine appointment. Like, let's confirm your insurance, demographic questions. That would be helpful. 
  - I feel the VA is behind a little bit. For example, I think that texting the Veterans would be better instead of calling. Texting captures everyone's attention. Ultimately, two way texting to patients.
  - To text a reminder or gather other information would be very helfpul. 
  - A lot of the problem is that the providers are running 10-15 minutes late. Sometimes they don't have time to tell the nurse to let them know that the provider is running late. 
  - Sometimes the patients are very vegilant and will call at 4:02 and say that the provider is late. Having a way to connect with the patient would be helpful. 
  - It's very challenging for deaf or hard of hearing patients. Often I talk to the family member who mediates. I'm not really directly talking to the patient. It's difficult to communicate via a family member. Sometimes the patient gets frustrated and just stops talking. At least in person, we can see each other. So, the phone is the least helpful modality for communicating with hard of hearing Veterans. 

- Has there been any existing plans discussed at your practice or other ideas you haven’t yet shared to help improve or streamline the patient experience for scheduling a telephone appointment? Specifically, the time between when a patient schedules an appointment to when their appointment begins?  
  - n/a 

- Lastly, are there any other providers, clinical or administrative staff that you feel would be valuable for us to speak with about understanding the current process or pain points of scheduling or beginning a telephone appointment (to help improve the Veteran or staff experience)? 
  - I think that I'm pretty knowledgeable of their interactions in my capacity. 

## If time permits: 

- Have you heard any feedback, positive or negative, from Veterans, providers or administrative staff about telephone appointments?
  - I think even though the VA is trying to emphasize VVC, telephone appointments are utilized a lot more, at least at our facility. 
  - If it's a more detailed discussion, that often leads to, "I need to bring you in," and me needing to schedule an in-person visit. So, it depends on why we're having a phone conversation. 
  - Telephone appointments are good for simpler questions, but often are a starting point to assess whether a face to face is needed. 
  - It is less used than during the pandemic. 
  - In primary care, we have 30 minutes, technically, or 60 minutes. But, a bunch of it is eaten up by the check-in process. So we have less time with the patient. They have to ask them a whole bunch of question "reminders." Depending on their health issues, or other factors, there may be no questions or a million questions before I'm able to see them. 
  - I know there's at least one electronic effort to migrate those questions to the patient before they see us. That would be incredibly helpful if they can answer some of those questions and they can be inputted into our EMR. So, none of us have to ask those and waste time. 
  - Asking the following would be helfpul: medication reconciliation review, non priority type questions that are listed in the "reminders," (e.g., are you homeless vs. are you sucicidal) basic demographics, immunizations (especially on the coast here people see private providers and we don't even know what they got in terms of flu shots), recent lab work that they got privately, etc. 
  - Would gain time if we could automate those questions. 

- When scheduling a telephone appointment, is any information captured from a patient that’s different from an in-person visit?
  - n/a
