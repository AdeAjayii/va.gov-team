## Research Findings 

### Potential Opportunities 

- A pre-check-in experience for Veterans to, 1) capture pre-registration information, and 2) remind the patient of the appointment type/modality to better prepare for their appointment
- The pre-registration information would include non priority-type questions from the "reminders" that the LPN's and MSA's complete over the phone prior to an appointment. E.g., any data from private labs like immunizations or blood work, low priority behavioral health questions, etc. 
- A check-in solution to:
  - Let the provider know the patient is ready
  - Enable the patient to tell the provider they're ready, confirm or edit their phone number, remind them of the appointment type/modality and educate them on what to do next (e.g., wait for the provider to call)
  - A check-in solution to notify the patient that the provider is running X minutes late

## Open Items and Questions

- Investigate the two phone numbers saved in the EMR. E.g., can one be specified for appointments? 
- Investigate the migration project that's happening. And, is it migrating pre-registration health questions to Cerner? What's the timing of this migration project? 
- How might we make the telephone appointment experience easier for Veterans who are deaf or hard of hearing to communicate with the provider? 

## Next Steps

- Determine MVP scope for telephone appointments integration with pre-check-in and/or check-in. E.g., is there an MVP solution vs. creating the north star solution?  
- Create research plan for Veteran research
