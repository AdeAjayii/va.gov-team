## Background and Goals 

- The CIE product team has decided to integrate telephone appointments into the product based on conversations with VVC stakeholders and consideration of scope. Specifically, we'll look at how telephone appointments might connect with both the pre-check-in experience and the day of check-in experience. 

### Research Goals

- Determine what value, if any, check-in on day of has for the Veteran for telephone appointments. E.g., reviewing information, editing information, confirming phone number to call, etc. 
- Determine what value, if any, pre-check-in has for Veterans for telephone appointments. (How to connect VEText to pre-check-in workflow, how to emphasis the number to be used for telephone appointments, how to place more emphasis on the appointment type/modality, etc.) 

### Research Questions

#### Background

- How many providers make up the Family Medicine practice at ***?
- Do you see patients at any other locations?
- Do all providers within the Family Medicine practice at *** accept telephone appointments?

#### Current Telephone Appointment Workflow

- How do patients currently schedule telephone appointments? (In person, over the phone, etc.) When does it typically take place? E.g., before or after an appointment. And, what information is collected from patients?

- Is there any information that you’d like collected that currently isn’t? (And, how might that information be used?)

- Are all patients (e.g., new vs. returning), appointment types (e.g., screening, follow up, etc.) and reasons for their visit all able to schedule a telephone appointment (vs. in-person)? What are some of those patient eligibility requirements to schedule a telephone appointment?

- Are appointment reminders or any pre-registration sent to patients before a scheduled telephone appointment? If so, what information is typically in those communications and how are they delivered to patients? E.g., VeText, phone calls, emails, etc.

- What typically happens immediately before a scheduled telephone appointment? For example, does the provider call the patient directly at the time of the appointment? Are there multiple phone numbers to try if the patient doesn’t pick up?

- Besides the provider, are any other administrative or clinical staff involved during a scheduled telephone appointment?

#### Current Telephone Appointment Feedback

- Are there any common logistical problems the day of a scheduled phone appointment? E.g., wrong phone number, patient didn’t answer, patient is late, etc.

- What steps, solutions or ideas, if any, do you think could help improve or fix those types of problems?

#### Future State

- Any thoughts (e.g., advantages or disadvantages) about a scenario where scheduled telephone appointments are connected with a patient mobile pre-registration or mobile day-of, check-in solution (that confirms patient contact information or notifies the provider the patient is ready for their appointment)?

- Has there been any existing plans discussed at your practice or other ideas you haven’t yet shared to help improve or streamline the patient experience for scheduling a telephone appointment? Specifically, the time between when a patient schedules an appointment to when their appointment begins?

- Lastly, are there any other providers, clinical or administrative staff that you feel would be valuable for us to speak with about understanding the current process or pain points of scheduling or beginning a telephone appointment (to help improve the Veteran or staff experience)?

#### If Time Permits 

- Have you heard any feedback, positive or negative, from Veterans, providers or administrative staff about telephone appointments?

- When scheduling a telephone appointment, is any information captured from a patient that’s different from an in-person visit?

## Research Findings 

### Patient Preferences 

- "Texting is way more effective than calling these days," (for appointment reminders).
- Patients might prefer phone appointments over VVC due to its efficiency for low acuity needs. 

### Challenges and Pain Points

- Provider is unsure what phone number to use located in the EMR. It has two numbers, but doesn't indicate which should be used for appointments. 
- Sometimes the provider is running 10-15 minutes late and needs a way to easily communicate with the patient. 
- Patients aren't always aware of their appointment modality. E.g., phone, VVC, office. Some patients will show up at the office for a phone appointment. (The problem is that communication doesn't include the modality, e.g., postcards.)
- Often, patients aren’t sure where to go to get information regarding their phone appointment. E.g., which phone numbers should they call? 
- No uniformity for pre-check in across sites at the VA. Different sites do appointment reminders and pre-registration differently. 
- Currently, there are appointment reminders in place, but the different types may overlap and provide different information. E.g., calls from MSAs, LPNs, postcards and VeText messages, Audiocare, etc. 
- Overall, the check-in process takes up a lot of time. Unfortunately, it takes time away from the provider with the patient. E.g., reminders (health information), medication reconciliation, demographics, private immunizations, private lab work, etc. There's an effort to migrate the check-in process to an electronic solution, which we need to be aware of. 
- Provider describes telephone appointments with Veterans who are deaf or hard of hearing, especially difficult. Veterans often have a caregiver join the call to help relay information, but Veterans often get frustrated at the experience. 

## Potential Opportunities 

- A pre-check-in experience for Veterans to, 1) capture pre-registration information, and 2) remind the patient of the appointment type/modality to better prepare for their appointment
- The pre-registration information would include non priority-type questions from the "reminders" that the LPN's and MSA's complete over the phone prior to an appointment. E.g., any data from private labs like immunizations or blood work, low priority behavioral health questions, etc. 
- A check-in solution to:
  - Let the provider know the patient is ready
  - Enable the patient to tell the provider they're ready, confirm or edit their phone number, remind them of the appointment type/modality and educate them on what to do next (e.g., wait for the provider to call)
  - A check-in solution to notify the patient that the provider is running X minutes late 

## Open Items and Questions

- Investigate the two phone numbers saved in the EMR. E.g., can one be specified for appointments? 
- Investigate the migration project that's happening. And, is it migrating pre-registration health questions to Cerner? What's the timing of this migration project? 
- How might we make the telephone appointment experience easier for Veterans who are deaf or hard of hearing to communicate with the provider? 

## Next Steps

- Determine MVP scope for telephone appointments integration with pre-check-in and/or check-in. E.g., is there an MVP solution vs. creating the north star solution?  
- Create research plan for Veteran research
