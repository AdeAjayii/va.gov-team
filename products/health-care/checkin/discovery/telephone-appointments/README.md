Telephone Appointments

Based on conversations with the VVC stakeholders, the CIE product team and estimated level of efforts, we've decided to focus on one type of telemedicine type: telephone appointments. 

Specifically, we'll look at how telephone appointments might connect with both the pre-check-in experience and day of check-in experience. 

What we've learned so far (high level notes from conversation with Shane Elliot)
 - Telephone appointments are usually scheduled as a follow-up from a previous appointment
 - The provider calls the Veteran at the appointment type; sometimes a nurse may call beforehand to confirm the Veteran is available and answer some standard screening questions
 - Stop codes are how the VA categorizes care. Telephone appooinments have their own stop code (specifically, a secondary stop code). This is true for in-person and video visits as well. 
 - It would be beneficial to the provider to confirm that the Veteran is available and ready for their telephone appointment. 
 - There is value in having the Veteran confirm their telephone number prior to the appointment
 - There may be value to have Veterans check-in for telephone appointments as a way to have them confirm that they are ready / available for the doctor to call 
 - Some patients may need to be reminded that the appointment is via telephone not on site
 - Notifications
        - Appointment reminders may or may not be sent out. It really depends on the facility. If they are sent out, the frequency will vary. The default is 7, 2, 1 days prior to appointment (see example of texts below)
        - All telephone notificatons are sent via VeText

Scope of studies
-  Day of check-in study will ask: What value (if any) does checking-in on the day of a telephone appointment provide for the Veteran? 
         -  Reviewing information - is this relevant? 
         -  Editing information - possibly 
         -  Confirming the patient is ready for the appointment - possibly
         -  Confirming the phone number the provider needs to cal - possibly (explore the Kano method)
- Pre-check-in study will ask: What value (if any) does completing pre-check-in have for Vetrans with a telephone appointment? 
        -  Exploring how to connect the VeTEXT SMS text to the pre-check-in flow
        - Exploring how best to emphasise the phone number confirmation (is current contact info form sufficient or do we need another screen?)
        - Emphasise that this is appointment is telephone, not on site, and the doctor will call you. 

Next steps
- Schedule meeting with Dr. Warren Hsu to understand the current state of telephone appointments from the provider / staff perspective 
- Draft conversation / question to for telephone appointment stakeholder (provider) meeting
- Stephen to talk to legal about any requirements we need to be aware re: use of Veteran telephone 
- Exploratory / initial technical discussion with engineering
