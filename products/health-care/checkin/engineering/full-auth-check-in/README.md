# Fully Authenticated Check-In Support

## Summary

Allow some of our authenticated applications (e.g. Mobile app, Health Apartment, VAOS) to use the PCI API to pre-check-in and check-in a Veteran for their appointment.

We should avoid using LoROTA as that was designed as an alternative to requiring veterans to fully authenticate. This will require engineering to write LoROTA-less versions of the lambdas that allow veterans complete pre-check-in and check-in tasks.

## Questions:
Can we see their appointment payload? (VAOS)

Do they know which appointments have e-check-in enabled?

How can we have security confidence that the patient is checking into only their appointments?

## Internal questions:

Where do we update CW? Assume itâ€™s the same as e-check-in

What does CHIP currently do? (our question for us)


## Endpoints:

Needed to show button -> 

E-check-in enabled appointments (they could already have this info in their current payload from VAOS)

Check-in window and eligibility data

Patient clicks a button ->
IntiateMobileCheckIn -> fetch appointment/veteran data from -> return to mobile app (demographics status/info) -> mobile app can ask to update info or not -> call check-in endpoint

CheckInMobile -> Post with patient IEN and Appointment IEN, set eCheckInComplete in vista.


## What needs to happen to be able to check-in
- Appointment needs to be at a clinic with e-check-in enabled
- Appointment must be within check-in window
- Patient must of current insurance info (our business rule)
- Patient must have confirmed demographics in the past 7 days (our business rule)
- Set eCheckInStarted (happens in initiateCheckIn now), setCheckIn, and eCheckInComplete in vista
- Log success
