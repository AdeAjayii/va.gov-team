## Proposed Workflows:

## Existing Systems:
### Vets-API
### CHIP
### LoROTA
### VISTA

### VA.gov Profile

> The VA.gov profile provides a centralized place where users can see what information the VA knows about them, 
> and where they can update that information as needed.
>
> The VA.gov profile is a section of VA.gov, which you can view at https://staging.va.gov/profile/personal-information 
> with pretty much any staging user. The VA.gov profile is a frontend only; we do not store any information. 
> We rely entirely on various VA backend systems to show and save data. VA Profile is only one of them, 
> which we currently use to show and save contact information.
>
> Currently, the VA.gov profile supports the following information:
>
> * Personal information
> * Contact information
> * Military information
> * Direct deposit information
> * Notification preferences
> * Account security
> * Connected apps (managed by the Lighthouse team)

### VA Profile
> This is a backend system that was formerly known as Vet360. 
> It came about in 2018 to act as a connector between a bunch of VA backends and frontends, 
> so that veterans could update their info in one place and it would save everywhere (or almost everywhere). 
> The VA Profile team is not part of the OCTO/DEPO contracts.
> They are an entirely separate team that we work with, and they work with a lot of other teams.
