# EDITING WRAP-UP

## Purpose
The purpose of this is to document the state of the editing work as of 4/7/2022. The team had begun to work on a feature to allow Veterans, while using the pre-check-in feature, to edit their information in-place. This included their demographis, emergency contact, and next of kin contact information. It was determined that our low-risk one-time-access (LoROTA) authenitcation would not be sufficient to allow Veterans to edit their personal information and that editing would require full authentication. The decision was then made to de-prioritize this editing work and pivot to simply providing Veterans with some messaging and link to their VA profile where they where they could update their information directly in their profile.
