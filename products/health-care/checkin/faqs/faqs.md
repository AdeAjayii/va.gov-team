| ------------------- | ----------  | 
| **Can a family member or caregiver complete eCheck-in?** | VEText checks the Cell and Home Phone field in VSE GUI. VSE GUI only lets users (e.g., MSAs) update the Home and Work phone field; not Cell field. They can edit the Home Phone to be the patient's cell phone number which is fairly typical these days with less people having traditional landlines. Otherwise, they'd have to use an appropriate VistA menu to update the Cell phone field. E.g., Pre-Register a Patient menu would be one such menu that they could use but they might not have access to it and is a lengthy menu to navigate just to edit one value.<br/><br/>So, for checking in, VEText checks the cell and home phone fields, and if either of those matches the one the Veteran (or their caregiver) is using to text "check in," then it will work. So, yes, eCheck-in can support a caregiver checking in, i.e., only from the standpoint of if the caregiver's number is listed as the Veteran's home or cell number in VistA. |
| **Does eCheck-in work if the same phone number is associated with more than 1 Veteran?** | Yes, it does work, but only if the two or more Veterans don't both have appointments on the same day. If they do, VEText will error out and they will be told via VEText upon texting "check in" to 53079 to check in at the desk with an MSA. |
