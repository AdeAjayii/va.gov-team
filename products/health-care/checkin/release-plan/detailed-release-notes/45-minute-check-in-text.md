# 45-MINUTE ONLINE CHECK-IN TEXT 

## PURPOSE

Proactively send Veterans a text message with their customized check-in link 45-minutes before their health care appointment time. Veterans can now complete online check-in without having to text "check in" to 53079 to receive their check-in link.

- NOTES:
    - Veterans who do NOT have text notifications enabled will NOT receive the new text message
    - Veterans who have a health appointment at a facility where online check-in is NOT enabled will NOT receive the next text message
    - Veterans who have already checked in for their health appointment with staff will NOT receive the new text message 

### CHANGES TO PRE-CHECK-IN

- When Veterans complete the pre-check-in workflow, they will see a message on the confirmation page that tells them that they will be receiving a text 45-minutes before their health appointment that will provide them with their check-in link.
