### Warm up questions - 3 minutes 

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
> Yes

- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in.)
> Yes. Through the BTSSS portal online.

- What device are you using to join this session today?
> iPhone

### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
> The last time I did a claim was about 2 days ago. And, honestly, I hate it. You have to go on to the VA.gov website, then sign in with the ID.me, but with the ID.me it's the two-step factor, and that's annoying, then scroll through the VA website, find the link that says "travel reimbursement" and wait for that to load. It's just really tedious and time consuming. Then, you have to wait for it to load. And, to create the claim, if it's not on there... I have a lot of community care appointments that I have to create and it's just a hassle, e.g., putting all the information in their and saving the address. And, just to submit it, it takes a while. If I don't have the time to call in to file the claim, at least I can log in and do it online. I go in and do like 5 at a time.

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
> If the VA and community care providers already have that in the system ready to go, that would be it. 

- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)
> I haven't had the other types of claims.

### Task #1: BTSSS status questions - 10 minutes

- Submitted for Payment
> My claim was approved. Claim approved [would be better].
> It's important because I want to know if there was a problem, like if it was pending, denied, etc. If it was approved, then I don't have to chase anyone down. 
 
- Payment Canceled
> I haven't encountered. But, guessing it's been denied after an error. Probably saying, "Denied" or "Pending."

- Denied
> I'm not getting payment. There's something missing or I don't qualify for reimbursement.
> This was is very important. 

- Approved for Payment
> The claim was approved. Nothing confusing.
> Very important. 

- In Manual Review
> That I have successfully submitted my claim. Nothing confusing. Does manual review mean that the computer or someone is going to review my information?
> Somewhere in the middle. I don't know. 

- On Hold
> I have no clue. What's the difference between waiting for manual review and on hold? Have they gotten to it or not? 

- Saved
> It's saved, but I haven't submitted it yet. It's pretty clear.
> Sometimes I think I have submitted it, but I haven't. So, it's very important to know if it's been submitted. Because I don't have pictures of the community care forms needed for evidence, I'll often have to go back and upload to my computer, and then go back to my claim. 

- Claim Paid
> That I should probably check my bank account to confirm. Pretty clear.
> Yes, [very important].

- Incomplete
> There's information missing. It's pretty clear.
> Very important. 

- Fiscal Rescinded
> I have no clue. Probably appealed something and they made the final decision.
> I guess it [seems important], but sort of confusing. 

- Claim Submitted
> I've successfully submitted my claim.
> Important. 

- Were there any other terms you expected to be here that were not included?
> I don't think so.

### Task #2 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email** 

- Now, imagine you just received this email from VA about filing for travel reimbursement after two visits to your VA Medical Center on November 13th, 2023.

- Go ahead and review it.

- Is there anything confusing about this information?
> No.

- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in an email like this?
> No, it's really great. It has a link to start the claim so I don't have to scroll through anything. I would click that link to start the claim.

**Appointment list**

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Was there anything confusing about that process? 
> No. [I noticed] that link to start filing the claim.

- Where were you expecting to end up?

- Now let’s take a look at what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?

- Now without doing anything yet, tell me a little about what you’d do next.

- What about the x/close button in the card? What would you expect to happen if you selected that?
- And if you did select to dismiss it, how would you find that information again?
- And what would you expect if you DID NOT select that x/close button?
