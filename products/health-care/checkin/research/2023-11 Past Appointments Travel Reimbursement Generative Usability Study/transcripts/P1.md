### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
> The last time I did a claim was about 2 days ago. And, honestly, I hate it. You have to go on to the VA.gov website, then sign in with the ID.me, but with the ID.me it's the two-step factor, and that's annoying, then scroll through the VA website, find the link that says "travel reimbursement" and wait for that to load. It's just really tedious and time consuming. Then, you have to wait for it to load. And, to create the claim, if it's not on there... I have a lot of community care appointments that I have to create and it's just a hassle, e.g., putting all the information in their and saving the address. And, just to submit it, it takes a while. If I don't have the time to call in to file the claim, at least I can log in and do it online. I go in and do like 5 at a time.

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how youâ€™d want it, what would it be like? 

- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)
