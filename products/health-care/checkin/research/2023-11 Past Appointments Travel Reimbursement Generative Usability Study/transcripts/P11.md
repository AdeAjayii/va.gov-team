## Transcription 

### Warm up questions - 3 minutes 

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
  > Yes

- Have you used the appointments tool on Va. Gov. To schedule and manage your health appointments before?
 > I've used the appointment option to check on times and dates. I've never scheduled one, though normally I'll send the out patient clinic I go to a message if I need to schedule an appointment.
  
- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in.)
  > Yeah, I use text check in now and what they do now is offer me that opportunity after I complete text check in to automatically apply for travel pay. That was on the 29th of November was the last time.

- And is that the only method that you've used so far to to file?
  > No, prior to text check-in and the options to file then, I went to the btsss site. I'm not terribly comfortable with that, because, I mean I managed get through it, but it's not as simple as I would prefer it to be. It was brand new to me to file my own travel request. So sometimes it's been not quite as specific as they wanted, and that could have been why it was declined. I'm not sure. But I would prefer a little more simplicity on that site.

- What device are you using to join this session today?
  > I'm using an iPhone.

- And are you using a screen magnification tool at all today?
  > I have my text pumped up a little bit, that's all.

### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > I've also, I will tell you I've also used the link via my healthy vet to get into the travel. Pay a URL and then I think there was even a after the second URL where I sign in, II finally get to the Btss side btss side the last time was was, as I said, be a text check-in, and that was, that was a breeze, you know I had. I just clicked on the button that said, Yeah, let's take care of it now and and I got a response that it was automatically submitted.

   > Prior to that. Excuse me, prior to that. Yeah. to me. It's really difficult. Because II frankly, I'm not. I have to wonder when I file on my own. which specific sites should certainly go to the first time.  and and and I'm not quite sure what that would be. So II tried the healthy, best site. There's a link there to go to travel pay I believe from there I sign in via login.gov. and then II think I reached the Btss. Side
   > And then I go. There's another option. I can't remember. Now. Where where do I go? see what it is? It's complicated. Because there's more than one site. I think I go to. Va. Gov. Actually, if I can't, if I can't figure it out via the healthy bedside. I'll go to va.gov I'm not sure if there's a travel pay  length. There I believe there is. But I'm not sure. so what I've done is bookmarked. The the Vichy, the beneficiary travel. Yeah, URL. And and I can go directly to that now. I believe there's also another one I just remembered. So it is complicated a E authorization. I think it's eos.va.gov. and so there's too many. you know II wanna be able to know what the default site is to go to. you know. touch a couple of buttons and be done with that this shouldn't be. It's complicated for me, so I have to believe it's complicated for other best as well. This is not this is not rocket science for me. I've been at this for years online and whatnot with backs and windows. But this particular exercise has me sometimes running in circles. Excuse me.


 


- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
  > 

- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)

**Email**


- Is there anything confusing about this information?
> 

- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in an email like this?
  > 

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here.
> 

**Appointment list**

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Was there anything confusing about that process? 
  > 

- Where were you expecting to end up?
  > 

- Now let’s take a look at what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
  > 

- Is there anything confusing here?
  > 

- What would you do next?
  > 
  
- What about the x/close button in the card? What would you expect to happen if you selected that?
  > 
  
- Would that'd be something you'd do?
  > 

- And if you did select to close it, what would you expect to happen to the information there? 
  > 
  

- And what would you expect to happen if you did not close this?
  > 

- Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next to file that claim.

- Tell me about your understanding of what's happened to your claim.
  > 

- And how is this similar or different to what you expected?
  > 

- And did you notice this claim mentions 2 appointments?
  >

- And so why do you think that the second appointment is included here when you've gone through the process of filing just once?
  > 

- And would you expect that 2 appointments like that would be included in one process of a claim?
  >
  
-  And what would you expect to happen next with your claim?
  > 

- And if you still had questions right now, how would you find out more about your claim?
  > 

- Go ahead and and do that.

- So I'm curious. Where did you expect that link to take you? And is that different or the same as where it took you.
  > 

- So then, did you notice the review? Your past appointments link?
  > 

- Where did you expect that to take you?
 > 

-  Ok, let's try that.

**Past appointments page**

-  Is this where you expected to go?
  >

- Knowing that you're looking for the details page, how would you find that?
  > 

- Okay, do you wanna try that for the second one? Tell me about this page now and what you were expecting.

**Appointment details page that's been filed**


- What do you think that type of care not noted means?
  > 

- Overall on this page, can you tell me about what is most important for you here?
  > 

- And did you notice the travel reimbursement section there at the bottom?
 > 

- I know we came here to learn more about your status, is this what you expected to find?
