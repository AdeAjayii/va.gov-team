### Warm up questions - 3 minutes 

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
  > Yes

- Have you used the appointments tool on Va. Gov. To schedule and manage your health appointments before?
 > I've used the appointment option to check on times and dates. I've never scheduled one, though normally I'll send the out patient clinic I go to a message if I need to schedule an appointment.
  
- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in.)
  > Yeah, I use text check in now and what they do now is offer me that opportunity after I complete text check in to automatically apply for travel pay. That was on the 29th of November was the last time.

- And is that the only method that you've used so far to to file?
  > No, prior to text check-in and the options to file then, I went to the btsss site. I'm not terribly comfortable with that, because, I mean I managed get through it, but it's not as simple as I would prefer it to be. It was brand new to me to file my own travel request. So sometimes it's been not quite as specific as they wanted, and that could have been why it was declined. I'm not sure. But I would prefer a little more simplicity on that site.

- What device are you using to join this session today?
  > I'm using an iPhone.

- And are you using a screen magnification tool at all today?
  > I have my text pumped up a little bit, that's all.

### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > I've also, I will tell you I've also used the link via MyHealtheVet to get into the travel pay URL, and then I think there was even after the second URL where I sign in, I finally get to the BTSSS site. The last time was, as I said, via text check-in, and that was a breeze. I just clicked on the button that said, 'yeah let's take care of it now,' and I got a response that it was automatically submitted.

   > Prior to that, to me, it's really difficult. I have to wonder when I file on my own, which specific sites should I certainly go to the first time, and I'm not quite sure what that would be. So I tried the myhealthevet site. There's a link there to go to travel pay. I believe from there I sign in via login.gov. and then I think I reached the BTSSS site.
   > And then I go - there's another option. I can't remember now, where where do I go? See what it is? It's complicated. Because there's more than one site. I think I go to Va.Gov actually, if I can't figure it out via the myhealthevet site I'll go to va.gov. I'm not sure if there's a travel pay link there. I believe there is, but I'm not sure.
   > So what I've done is bookmarked the beneficiary travel URL and and I can go directly to that now, I believe. There's also another one I just remembered. So it is complicated - eAuthorization. I think it's eauth.va.gov. So there's too many. I wanna be able to know what the default site is to go to, touch a couple of buttons, and be done with it. It's complicated for me, so I have to believe it's complicated for other Vets as well. This is not rocket science for me. I've been at this for years online and whatnot, with Macs and Windows, but this particular exercise has me sometimes running in circles. 

- How's your experience been? When you have reached the portal and have used it
  > Well, when I have to input the info on my own, that's another issue, because it has to be very specific, and there are occasions where, for example, my appointment might be at 11 o'clock in the morning and the provider doesn't take me until, let's say, 11:17. Apparently the Beneficiary Travel Office needs to know the exact time it started and the exact time that it ended, my appointment, and I have to be either very careful that I remember, or jot down notes, or take a screenshot or something, or it's not gonna be approved because they will suggest the time doesn't exist, with no explanation. The travel office should know that I made the appointment, certainly. There should be some sort of electronic give and take between the outpatient clinic and the travel pay office that says, yeah, he was sure at this time the appointment was completed. So it is frustrating.
  > And the form to fill out. I'd love to have it more simplistic as well. Obviously I know what the outpatient clinic's name is. I know that know the physicians name, you need to input that, and also the time. Sometimes it just doesn't work properly, even if I input that correct information. So I've had several occasions where it's been denied. Other times, they've rearranged the title that I give it because apparently it has to be a specific title as well. For example, if I'm seeing a pediatrist, I'm not sure whether I should put in the outpatient clinic, which is a part of the VA facility. And that can deny me as well.
  > And and even if my time on the appointment is off, I'm sure that the Travel Department can either contact them or they they should get it. They should get a notice electronically that my appointment was completed. I would think that they do

- Are the claims that you file usually mileage only claims. Or do you have receipts that you add as well?
  > No, they're always mileage-only. I mean there might come a time where I have to stay overnight, but that hasn't happened. And I've been going to the same clinic for 35 years now. So there's occasions where you do have to stay overnight, whether it be weather, or there's something else the doctor wants to do, or whatever, but just mileage for now.

- And if you ever have 2 appointments at the same facility on the same day, do you create multiple claims for those appointments.
  > Well, I think I've tried, but in retrospect it's probably not the best idea. I mean, I'm only driving down there once, obviously. And I'm only driving back once. But that brings up another question that I can't answer: if I have to do this on my own rather than having it done automatically via text check in, I wouldn't know which appointment to input to the travel pay URL and the form. I'm assuming it would be the first one, but, frankly, it might not be. I don't know.
  > Actually, that's gonna happen in January. I've got 2 back-to-back appointments, so we'll see. I think I'll use text check-in in January, and that should take care of it.

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
  > I've got a number of Va sites bookmarked. Well, obviously, to me, I keep lauding the positives of text check-in, and that would be my first choice. I mean, it's just flawless. I've never had an issue with it. So I use that now, but there might come a time when my phone might not pick up a signal or something, or text check-in isn't available, I should say, so I would want one URL to go to just like every other VA Department in sight, just one URL, and that would be va.gov is what you guys are working on, I guess. Go there and be able to findthe link for travel pay reimbursement, and then have it work the same way text check-in works, you know? Simple question, would you like to file for travel reimbursement for your appointment on such and such a day? Click yes. And thank you for your service, you know. That's that's pretty much it. Simplicity. Because there are so many VA sites right now, and I know that you all are compressing them because I know I've noticed a difference over the past few years. Certainly. But there is still a slew of 'em. Messaging is a big help as well, because if I can't find an answer I'll message a certain department. But there's still a lot of sites that I'd prefer to have deleted from my devices that I rarely go to.

 
- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)
  > I'm not sure what you mean. I just, I'm not sure what how to respond to that.
- Anything that comes to mind. As far as how you think of your travel claims in relation to any other claims. And if nothing comes to mind, that's fine, too.
  > Well, I mean, it's obviously a plus. It pays for my gas.
  > And something else I could mention about this as well. This might be taken away once again. I had it for a certain number of years, and then I didn't have it for well over a decade, for some reason. I contacted the travel office last October 2022, and they said, "Yeah, you're eligible." And so that's when I started this process again of requesting travel pay.
  > The only other benefit I get from the VA is a direct deposit disability check, and that's been flawless since the eighties, I believe. Travel pay online, receiving the travel pay allowance is fantastic. Without it, it's not gonna break the bank on my end, but it's something I feel that is warranted. I'm making the trip down. It's about a hundred mile round trip. Why not go for it? Having said that I can't say anything else else about about it. I can't offer you any more feedback about it, I don't think, aside from the simplicity factor when applying for it. It's a great option to have. I really don't have anything else to say about it.


### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**


- Is there anything confusing about this information?
> 

- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in an email like this?
  > 

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here.
> 

**Appointment list**

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Was there anything confusing about that process? 
  > 

- Where were you expecting to end up?
  > 

- Now let’s take a look at what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
  > 

- Is there anything confusing here?
  > 

- What would you do next?
  > 
  
- What about the x/close button in the card? What would you expect to happen if you selected that?
  > 
  
- Would that'd be something you'd do?
  > 

- And if you did select to close it, what would you expect to happen to the information there? 
  > 
  

- And what would you expect to happen if you did not close this?
  > 

- Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next to file that claim.
  
**Intro page**

- And did you notice this claim mentions 2 appointments?
  >

- And so why do you think that the second appointment is included here when you've gone through the process of filing just once?
  > 

- And would you expect that 2 appointments like that would be included in one process of a claim?
  >
  
-  And what would you expect to happen next with your claim?
  > 

- And if you still had questions right now, how would you find out more about your claim?
  > 

- Go ahead and and do that.

  > 

- So then, did you notice the review? Your past appointments link?
  > 

- Where did you expect that to take you?
 > 

-  Ok, let's try that.

**Past appointments page**

-  Is this where you expected to go?
  >

- Knowing that you're looking for the details page, how would you find that?
  > 

- Okay, do you wanna try that for the second one? Tell me about this page now and what you were expecting.

**Appointment details page that's been filed**


- What do you think that type of care not noted means?
  >
