### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > Yes, so I actually submitted a claim almost 4 weeks ago. I used the BTSSS site and logged in with my DS Login information, the username and password. Once I got into the system, and it, of course, asks you your security questions, they send you a link to put in to verify it. Once I go through the link to verify, it gives me a message that says, "Please wait, we're gathering your information." I recently had to update my banking information on the site. They have a disclaimer to send - I wanna say effective sometime this year - that claims are being sent electronically. I believe they're trying to get away from some paper checks. And if we don't have updated bank information on file, it can delay receiving any type of travel reimbursement.
  
  > So I updated my information. Then I went in to create a claim. The system gives you a chance to see any appointments that you have. For the most part, some of the my apartments do pop up. I don't know if it's something that the clinics have to do on their end to close it out or whatever the case may be. They will pop up, and then I can go in to create a claim that way. If my appointment does not show up automatically, I will have to go in the system and create a claim, so I have to go in and report the, manually put in information for the appointment, put in a clinic name, the address, the date of the claim, I mean the date of the appointment, the time, and an address for that. I put that information in, if I have to manually create the appointment I put it in, then I initiate the "create the claim" portion. Go in, put my starting address, my home address where I left from and which appointment I went to. It's usually [clinic] is where the majority of my appointments are. If I have to go see my PCM for something, that's a different address, and as a matter of fact, I just had an appointment yesterday in [location] that I have to probably go in today and try to create the claim for that as well.
  
  > So put that information in. It would ask me questions: What am I trying to claim? It gives you the options when you toggle through the system of mileage, food, options such as that. So I always claim the mileage portion. And it actually, if it's a one way trip or round trip, I put one round trip, and sometimes the system will act right to where I can get the information in. I will honestly say the last few times, and prior to disappointment when I had to create a claim, the system used Bing maps, and for whatever reason that system is down for Bing maps, so a lot of times I have issues trying to even create, um complete the claim because if Bing's maps is not working, it won't pull up any data. So that's the only downside with using the BTSSS portal is Bing maps has been acting that way for a while. Even when I was doing claims last year as well. It's a hit and miss with trying to get that claim to link with the Bing maps, if you do it electrically. That's been my experience with it.

-  Ok, and you said that that has been happening since last year. Does that prevent you, then, from filing your claim?
  > So prior to when the VA came out with. Now everything has to be done. Within 30 days prior to that I go in and try at least once a week to try to get it to work, and it will always be a hit and miss. But eventually I guess the system decide to communicate with being mapped in the work. Now with me it's more concerning because if a claim is not filed within 30 days of the appointment date. it's not gonna be approved for travel reimbursement. So that's the issue I have. I haven't went in today. But I'm going to go in today because I have to and create the other claim from the appointment for Monday or Tuesday. But that's been issue with the previous appointment that I file.

- And just to make sure I'm understanding, have you had any claims at all that you haven't been able to file because of that? Or have they all eventually worked out so far?




- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
  > 

- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had? (Note: How is travel reimbursement similar or different to the other claims?)

### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**


- Is there anything confusing about this information?
> 

- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in an email like this?
  > 

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here.
> 

**Appointment list**

- Ok, I’ll have you stop here. Was there anything confusing about that process? 
  > 

- Where were you expecting to end up?
  > 

- Now let’s take a look at what’s on this page. Can you briefly review the page and tell me about it?
  > 

- Is there anything confusing here?
  > 

- What would you do next?
  > 
  
- What about the x/close button in the card? What would you expect to happen if you selected that?
  > 
  
- Would that'd be something you'd do?
  > 

- And if you did select to close it, what would you expect to happen to the information there? 
  > 
  

- And what would you expect to happen if you did not close this?
  > 

- Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next to file that claim.
  
**Intro page**

-Is there anything confusing about this page and the information included here?
  > 

- And how clear are the steps for filing a travel reimbursement claim?
  > 

- And how clear are the 2 options for filing a claim?
  > 

- And can you tell me a little bit more about the numbers to the left of this information, how you perceive that those?
  > 

- Go ahead and continue

**Review page**

- Anything confusing about this page?
  > 

- Ok, go ahead and continue.

**Success page**

- Talk to me about this page and the information included here.
  > 

- Tell me about your understanding of what's happened to your claim.
  > 

- And how is this similar or different to what you expected?
  > 

- And did you notice this claim mentions 2 appointments?
  >

- And so why do you think that the second appointment is included here when you've gone through the process of filing just once?
  > 

- And would you expect that 2 appointments like that would be included in one process of a claim?
  >
  
-  And what would you expect to happen next with your claim?
  > 

- And if you still had questions right now, how would you find out more about your claim?
  > 

- Go ahead and and do that.

- So I'm curious. Where did you expect that link to take you? And is that different or the same as where it took you.
  > 

- So then, did you notice the review? Your past appointments link?
  > 

- Where did you expect that to take you?
 > 

-  Ok, let's try that.

**Past appointments page**

-  Is this where you expected to go?
  >

- Knowing that you're looking for the details page, how would you find that?
  > 

- Okay, do you wanna try that for the second one? Tell me about this page now and what you were expecting.

**Appointment details page that's been filed**


- What do you think that type of care not noted means?
  > 

- Overall on this page, can you tell me about what is most important for you here?
  > 

- And did you notice the travel reimbursement section there at the bottom?
 > 

- I know we came here to learn more about your status, is this what you expected to find?
  > 

- Okay. and where would you expect that link to go?
  > 

- Go ahead and select that link.
