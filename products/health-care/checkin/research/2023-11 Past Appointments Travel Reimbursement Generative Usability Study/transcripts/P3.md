### General Questions

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience?
  > Skipped because participant hasn't filed before
- So, knowing that you haven't filed yet. if you were to file, and that process could be. However you wanted it. What would it be like?
  > I would prefer it to be electronic where I could fill in some blanks. Go go to a website or link. Fill in some blanks of the relevant information time, date, appointment type, and then upload maybe a screenshot of the map that I traveled for distance. Because it would most likely be a reimbursement of miles, is that how that works?
- Moderator goes into some background on how filing works.
  > Then an attachment link would be helpful for me to attach receipt and relevant reimbursement paperwork.
- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had?
  > Can you clarify the question?
- Just thinking of. And in this case might have to imagine a little bit since you haven't filed yet. But thinking of travel, reimbursement claims, and then any other types of claims you have, how are those similar or different to you?
  > I guess the travel claim would be more simple. because it would just involve mileage and possible parking receipts and lodging and things like that. I could more simply upload that information and answer a few questions, whereas, like a medical claim for the disability would involve more paperwork as far as like filing the claim, uploading relevant medical records. Sometimes it's harder to get those medical records from various providers, you know, if you've gone to multiple clinics.
