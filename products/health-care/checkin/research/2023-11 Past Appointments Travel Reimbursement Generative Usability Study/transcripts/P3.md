### Warm-up Questions

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
  > Yes
- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in.)
  > No (was not aware of the possibility). _Note: Moderator decided to continue the session_
- What device are you using to join this session today?
  >Phone, Google Pixel 7
- Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
  > It depends - sometimes use screen magnification, sometimes subtitles

### General Questions

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience?
  > Skipped because participant hasn't filed before
- So, knowing that you haven't filed yet. if you were to file, and that process could be. However you wanted it. What would it be like?
  > I would prefer it to be electronic where I could fill in some blanks. Go go to a website or link. Fill in some blanks of the relevant information time, date, appointment type, and then upload maybe a screenshot of the map that I traveled for distance. Because it would most likely be a reimbursement of miles, is that how that works?
- Moderator goes into some background on how filing works.
  > Then an attachment link would be helpful for me to attach receipt and relevant reimbursement paperwork.
- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had?
  > Can you clarify the question?
- Just thinking of. And in this case might have to imagine a little bit since you haven't filed yet. But thinking of travel, reimbursement claims, and then any other types of claims you have, how are those similar or different to you?
  > I guess the travel claim would be more simple because it would just involve mileage and possible parking receipts and lodging and things like that. I could more simply upload that information and answer a few questions, whereas, like a medical claim for the disability would involve more paperwork as far as like filing the claim, uploading relevant medical records. Sometimes it's harder to get those medical records from various providers, you know, if you've gone to multiple clinics. As far as like if they have questions I can fill in the blank and then upload attachments, that would be the the biggest similarity in the claims. It would just be more paperwork, I think, for the actual medical disability claims.
  

## BTSSS Status Questions
- Submitted for Payment
  > Meaning: It means the claims department have all the information they need from me and it's been approved and they've submitted to their billing department for payment.
  
  > Confusing: The only confusing part is, is it me the the veteran submitting it for payment, or is it the VA submitting it for payment. That would be the confusing part, like is. Does that mean it's been approved? Or is it just me initially filing it.
  
  > How important: It would give me confirmation. If it's meant for the veteran, it would give me confirmation that I have completed all the steps that are needed. And then once I push submit that I've submitted to the department to review it for payment. So that's it's a good confirmation, whereas, like, if I am missing the paperwork or or step I would not get the prompt that it was submitted for payment, like it would say, please review, you know, section 2, or please add this attachment. And then, if it's the other way around, if it's for the government to reimburse it would give me a positive confirmation that they've approved it and I could be, you know, waiting for payment. So it just like I said, depends if it's referring to the veterans submitted for payment all their information, or if it means the Government has completed all their steps, and you know so that's why I don't. Without context, it's hard to know.
- Payment Canceled
  > Meaning: That means, for some reason they somewhere the accounting department made a mistake. They had initially approved my payment, but then they realized it was not eligible, and they canceled the payment.
  > Confusing: No just upsetting unless it was a wrong amount. And then, you know, they've updated the amount so it could be that payment canceled, and then they have a new payment in progress.
  > Importance: Well, this would be a red flag, you know. They would prompt the service number or the veteran to do something about it, you know, but maybe make a call check to see why it was cancelled. It would definitely prompt some action, I think.
- Denied
  > Pretty much the same thing. Except now the veteran would be required to investigate, why it was denied, and also prompt for action, you know. Maybe call in, or if there's a chat available to write, say, you know what information is missing. So typically, if I see denied, I would hope there is an explanation and speculation code or blurb saying deny due to missing information or travel is not authorized for this app, you know, just something. The word there alone feels insufficient. Denial code or something. Or more information as to what information needs to be added or resubmitted.
  > Importance: That's pretty important. It might be the most important, because if you're denied, then I think that would prompt the most action. Now you're if you submit for something, and you thought you were eligible, and now you've been denied, and it would prompt you to take action to remedy the situation.
- Approved for Payment
  > It's a very good to know. I mean, it's not the most important. But it's reassuring, you know, like, okay, I did everything right. I'll just wait for the process, you know, when the money comes in and comes in.
  > Confusion: Not at all.
