### Warm-up Questions

- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
  > Yes
- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in.)
  > No (was not aware of the possibility). _Note: Moderator decided to continue the session_
- What device are you using to join this session today?
  >Phone, Google Pixel 7
- Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
  > It depends - sometimes use screen magnification, sometimes subtitles

### General Questions

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience?
  > Skipped because participant hasn't filed before
- So, knowing that you haven't filed yet. if you were to file, and that process could be. However you wanted it. What would it be like?
  > I would prefer it to be electronic where I could fill in some blanks. Go go to a website or link. Fill in some blanks of the relevant information time, date, appointment type, and then upload maybe a screenshot of the map that I traveled for distance. Because it would most likely be a reimbursement of miles, is that how that works?
- Moderator goes into some background on how filing works.
  > Then an attachment link would be helpful for me to attach receipt and relevant reimbursement paperwork.
- We know there's different types of VA claims like disability claims, pension claims, travel reimbursement claims. Could you tell us about how you view your travel reimbursement claims compared to any other VA claims you've had?
  > Can you clarify the question?
- Just thinking of. And in this case might have to imagine a little bit since you haven't filed yet. But thinking of travel, reimbursement claims, and then any other types of claims you have, how are those similar or different to you?
  > I guess the travel claim would be more simple because it would just involve mileage and possible parking receipts and lodging and things like that. I could more simply upload that information and answer a few questions, whereas, like a medical claim for the disability would involve more paperwork as far as like filing the claim, uploading relevant medical records. Sometimes it's harder to get those medical records from various providers, you know, if you've gone to multiple clinics. As far as like if they have questions I can fill in the blank and then upload attachments, that would be the the biggest similarity in the claims. It would just be more paperwork, I think, for the actual medical disability claims.
  

## BTSSS Status Questions
- Submitted for Payment
  > Meaning: It means the claims department have all the information they need from me and it's been approved and they've submitted to their billing department for payment.
  
  > Confusing: The only confusing part is, is it me the the veteran submitting it for payment, or is it the VA submitting it for payment. That would be the confusing part, like is. Does that mean it's been approved? Or is it just me initially filing it.
  
  > How important: It would give me confirmation. If it's meant for the veteran, it would give me confirmation that I have completed all the steps that are needed. And then once I push submit that I've submitted to the department to review it for payment. So that's it's a good confirmation, whereas, like, if I am missing the paperwork or or step I would not get the prompt that it was submitted for payment, like it would say, please review, you know, section 2, or please add this attachment. And then, if it's the other way around, if it's for the government to reimburse it would give me a positive confirmation that they've approved it and I could be, you know, waiting for payment. So it just like I said, depends if it's referring to the veterans submitted for payment all their information, or if it means the Government has completed all their steps, and you know so that's why I don't. Without context, it's hard to know.
- Payment Canceled
  > Meaning: That means, for some reason they somewhere the accounting department made a mistake. They had initially approved my payment, but then they realized it was not eligible, and they canceled the payment.
  > Confusing: No just upsetting unless it was a wrong amount. And then, you know, they've updated the amount so it could be that payment canceled, and then they have a new payment in progress.
  > Importance: Well, this would be a red flag, you know. They would prompt the service number or the veteran to do something about it, you know, but maybe make a call check to see why it was cancelled. It would definitely prompt some action, I think.
- Denied
  > Pretty much the same thing. Except now the veteran would be required to investigate, why it was denied, and also prompt for action, you know. Maybe call in, or if there's a chat available to write, say, you know what information is missing. So typically, if I see denied, I would hope there is an explanation and speculation code or blurb saying deny due to missing information or travel is not authorized for this app, you know, just something. The word there alone feels insufficient. Denial code or something. Or more information as to what information needs to be added or resubmitted.
  > Importance: That's pretty important. It might be the most important, because if you're denied, then I think that would prompt the most action. Now you're if you submit for something, and you thought you were eligible, and now you've been denied, and it would prompt you to take action to remedy the situation.
- Approved for Payment
  > It's a very good to know. I mean, it's not the most important. But it's reassuring, you know, like, okay, I did everything right. I'll just wait for the process, you know, when the money comes in and comes in.
  > Confusion: Not at all.
- In Manual Review
  > It means all the information's been received by someone did. The word manual prompts me to think there is a person that is looking at all the data on the paperwork versus an automated review. So someone, a person, is actively looking at it.
  > Confusion: I don't think so. Okay, I haven't seen it very often, though. Manual review right? Like that doesn't. That's not very commonly used, I guess. I think I understood that if they want the veteran to think that someone, a person, is manually reviewing it, then I get, I think they got the point across, and that was the intent.
  > Importance: It's okay. It's not very important, but I at least it's reassuring to know that someone's looking at it. So maybe soon I'll get an answer versus you're in the queue and it there's an unknown wait period.
- On Hold
  > It's a little confusing, because, once you submit something, I assume it's going to be on hold until someone gets to it. But then, when you tell me it's on hold, I wonder, like am I in some queue or am I missing information. Am I just waiting because there's a long line and the person that's staffed is too busy? Or am I missing something and I need to resubmit? Or in queue, you know, or pending review, versus on hold tells me there's something missing or not right about the claim. If that's their intent, then I would hope to see something like On hold, more action needed, or submit additional information, or something like that. Like, Why am I on? Hold cause on, on hold is different than progressing or awaiting review, right?
  > Importance: It's a smaller red flag than the denied. But it's kind of important. If it's on hold, I'm like, well, if I'm proactive. I'd want to investigate. Why is it on hold? Is it? That's the confusing part is, if it's just in the queue. I'm not worried, I'm just waiting because you guys are busy.
- Saved
  > That I've successfully uploaded everything, and it saved to the database waiting review hopefully.
  > Confusion: no
  > Importance: It's just kind of confirmation that what I submitted was saved. So it's just it's kind of a feel good thing. Ok, it's not floating in some cloud and possibly missing with the ones and the zeros that it saved somewhere in the database and could be retrieved. So it's just a nice confirmation.
- Claim Paid
  > That's cool. That means I can check my bank account. It's about as good as the approve for payment. Nothing confusing about it.
  > Importance: If I needed the reimbursement, it would be important for me to check my account, just to to verify. It wouldn't be super important if I wasn't counting on the payment.
- Incomplete
  > that would be great to be included on Number 6 on hold and completed something like that on hold, you know due to incomplete submission or something like that. So it would prompt action. That's pretty important, like I need to go do something about it if I want to get payment.
They're related and could possibly be adjoined in the same field cause that would clarify the on hold.
  > Importance: Very. But they would tell me I need to take action if I wanted to complete my submission.
- Fiscal Rescinded
  > I don't know what that means, as far as reimbursement goes. I don't know that. Does that mean the payments been resend it like, have they retracted their budget? I don't know how that applies to a veteran. This sounds more like a budgetary term within the department for the accounting and budgeting purposes. It's probably better stated with other words, I don't know what that means. Rescinded. Usually me, I think, means like it's cancelled, or it was never valid in the beginning. Fiscal tells me it's a bigger branch than I mean, either it's like something from Congress, maybe. Or the Va. Department's budgets been resecinded. It's a bigger term than one travel department. It sounds like the whole VA department has some budgetary. So maybe like "budgetary constraints does not allow payment at this time. I don't know something more clarifying because those 2 words, I think I feel like the common layman won't know what that means. Those those feel like big words to me.
  > Importance: This one just makes me feel helpless like? I can't do anything about this. Why are you telling me this? You know, it's sort of out of the hands of it. Feels like it's out of the hands of the of the department, and the veteran sounds like there's big, bigger congress budget issues, like, there's some legislation that needs to be passed or something. And there's nothing anyone can do about that until you know the parties agree.
- Claim Submitted
  > A very affirm good affirmation to the veteran that everything I submitted was good to go, and it's moving along. But I just need to wait for the next step.
  > Confusion: Nope. I think that's a pretty standard language. Yeah. Claim submitted.
  > Importance: Medium. It just feels good that to know that I turned in everything I need to. And then, you know, I'll just wait for the next step.
- And then so we've gone through all of those. Were there any other terms that you expected to be here that weren't
  > Maybe received and pending review. Like, maybe, instead of in manual review that tells me someone has it on their desk, and it's pending review.
  

## Task 2: Usability Testing

- Now, imagine you just received this email from VA about filing for travel reimbursement after two visits to your VA Medical Center on November 13th, 2023. Go ahead and review it.
  > Okay, it's a reminder, you can file travel reimbursement. So I'm tempted to click on the sign in the Va. Gov. To start my claim. Is that what you want me to do?
- Is that what you would do next?
  > Yes. if I want to file a claim, that's what I would do. Yes.
- Okay, don't do that quite yet, but that's good to know. Is there anything about any of this information that is confusing?
  > No, it's very clear. If those were my appointments, I like the fact that it's bolded that I have 30 days after the appointment to file, so I would take action immediately. I would click on that "sign in to va.gov" to start my claim. And then I do like the link below where it says "Go to your past appointments" in case this letter does not include any past appointments that I think should be there and could verify. Yeah, I would go straight to the sign into va.gov, and start my claim.
- And how does this compare this, this example email compared to what you'd expect to be in an email like this?
  > I like, how succinct it is. If I was to expect a simple to-the-point email, this is it.
