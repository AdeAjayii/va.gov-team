### General travel questions - 5-7 minutes

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience? 
  > Well, I went on the account the VA account and I brought up the... I got something right here, I actually have a form that I just run through. It would take me to it but the last few times it wasn't bringing my appointments up on it, so I have a form I downloaded for the beneficiary for the Va travel pay, and it told me to go to  this website here, and then I click on it. See auth.va.gov access? and that would take me to it. And then that would go right into the veteran travel claim entry. And I was walking through that pretty much.
  > nd then it tells you. You know you go to veteran and then veteran travel claim entry, and then it would. Once I got into there. you know, I go through the the they they go through. How to I don't on my help net, which tell, you know, has a username and password. And then it takes you right to the beneficiary travel profile. So that was what I was doing.

-  About appointments not coming up
  > It worked for me for the longest time, but then, this last time it wouldn't come up on it. So I ended up having to go into the Travel office at the Va. And I actually filled it out the last one by hand, because it wasn't. And I went in to talk to the to the kid who worked in there, and he said apparently it had to. It didn't reset properly, so my appointments didn't come up, so I didn't really understand what he, what he! I understood what he was saying, but I said, Well, why is that? I said I didn't do anything, you know. All of a sudden it wasn't bringing my appointments up, and he said, oh, we'll reset it for you. And then he reset it, and once he did that they came up.

- Were they community care appointments?
  > No, just my doctor's appointments for my regular primary care, and for my dental and my optometry, and all those ones they, you know, cause normally they would come up, and then, when, after I went to the appointment, I would just go on, and I could just file, you know, walk through it, tell them I travel, pay, and all that, and it would have worked out. But then, this last time it didn't come up, and if you can't get the appointment, you can't, you know, won't let you fill out the voucher to to get paid.
  > So I. So I they have a handsheet here. I actually got a copy right here. I mean, I'm a Va. Form 1035, 42, which is just a manual one. and so I just filled it out by hand and handed it to him, and I got my pay another week later. So it did work once I did that. But I didn't. You know, I thought the idea was not to do it manually anymore.

- When appointments are listed, can you tell me about that?
  > Yeah, sure, I just they. They just walk you through the form. I mean it. You had to clamp create a claim. you know this thing tied, you create a claim, and then go on and just add any receipts or anything you have. And then you, basically, you know, make they double check. You're home or record and all that. And basically it was a simple, just walk through. They asked you the questions, where. you know, is this your home or record? And what are you filing for? Back and forth? And you know the one thing that was a little strange was I don't, which heats the guy told me at the Travel Office was they only paid you one way, which I didn't understand, because before I used to get paid both ways. So I don't know if that probably anything they'll do with you.


- Do you create multiple claims for different appointments on the same day? If you ever have 2 appointments during one visit to a facility?
  > Well, it's funny you say that I just had it happen I never had it happen before I had it happen. And I asked the guy at the travel office what to do. and he said, you can put them both in, but they're only gonna pay you for one of them is what he what I was told so electronically, I have never done it 2 in one day. But but I handed them to that day, and I only got paid for the one.

> Because the whole whole key is the appointment has to show up on you on your on your portal there. If the appointment doesn't come up, you can't put a claim in for it.


- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like? 
  > Okay, well, I'll be honest with you. I don't know if you're familiar the way they used to do it. Well, there was a there was a kiosk or a a little machine right in the appointment when I went in, and you just put your id card in in you to it. Walk you through a a similar thing as online here. And and it just it was filed. It was right there. You did it. You walked out. You knew that it was done, and that was that was so simple. As far as I'm concerned. I don't know why they they changed that because, you know, it was right in the office when you did it. And then when I went home, I didn't have to scroll around on the computer or anything. I thought that was very efficient. And I never had any problems with that.

- Confirming now you go home and file, not at the facility?
  > No, no, I come home. Yeah. It's simpler for me just to come home and go on my computer. Go to that website and go to the appointment and just, but hit the claim, start the claim, and then just do it. You know.
  > I mean, it's not that. It's it's not that hard. If if everything works. But you have to be able to get on that website as well. and sometimes that that hasn't been as easy as as it could. So I'm just saying, if you're in the office when it wasn't online, it was just put your Id card in and just walking right through.

  > You know there was no doubt about it. And then, plus what you want left the office. You know you didn't have anything else to do. Yeah, you were done. So

- Can you tell me more about difficulties getting to the website?
  > Yeah. Well, you have to. yeah, when it goes on, you have to have either a a a health net account or a Ds login. And sometimes that doesn't always work. Okay. I don't know you familiar with that, I'm sure, right that where they like authenticate, that's who you are. But it doesn't always go through. And so it's you know, it's a what you have to get through that to even get to the to the travel section.


### Task #1 - Usability Testing - 20 minutes

**Email**


- Is there anything confusing about this information?
  > No looks good.


- How does this compare to what you’d expect to be in an email like this?
  > It's good. I like the way you you can click on it. You don't have to mess around what they can go to anything, so it looks pretty pretty good. You you throw in 2 in there once to try and add to make it a little more difficult, though. Huh?

- Ok, thank you. Now, thinking out loud as you go along, please walk me through what you would do from here.
  > The only I don't like about here is you must file within 30 days of the appointment. I mean, I can do that. But other people I think that might be a problem for. But that's if you guys have to do it that way. I understand. But you know what I'm saying.
  > So I probably sign in to the Va. To start your claim, I would guess. But I'm not sure whether the app, once I hit. If I go to all your va past appointments, what that's gonna do if that's gonna bring me to. you know, if I'm gonna be able to go from there, or if that's just telling me my appointments (as far as the second link)
  > I guess that's telling me the past appointments. Right?

- What would you expect to be there?
  > I would expect. Well, I would just have hopefully have my appointments and then just click on the one and then just hit. Start, you know. Sign into Va to start my claim.

- So which link would you select here?
  > I would probably select the second one to make sure I knew the appointments.

- Okay, you can go ahead and try that.

**Past appointments**

- So what did you expect to find here? And how does this compare?
  > Yeah, that's the appointments, I guess. And I'm not sure what one task to complete means. That's not really clear. You know what I mean. I guess not. Sure what. What? Why, that would be there.

- Do you have any guesses of what that that would mean?
  > Well, hopefully, it'd be to tell me. I have to file the voucher for that. I haven't done it yet. That's what I would think, you know, cause. And then the other ones don't have that. This hopefully, I already fire. Well, there is one down the bottom there. Yeah. Okay. So the 3 that I've read, I would guess would hopefully be the ones that I have to fill out a voucher for. And then once I do it hopefully, you know, that won't be on there anymore. That's what I would think.

- Go ahead and continue with what you'd do next.
  > Okay? Well, I think I go to the first one and maybe hit on the appointment and see if hopefully, that would bring me to a a They want a  a claim. So I'll try that.
  
**Detail page**

> Okay. yeah, that's good. Then I hit. I probably hit the file for travel reimbursement. You want me to do it.

- Yeah, go ahead and do that.

**Intro page**

- Tell us about this page.
  > So check your eligibility. If you're eligible for health care, travel, reimbursement, you can file a reimclaim. Now. okay, if you're claiming only mileage. I'm on right now. Okay, well, it's a little confusing here. So it's asking me if I'm eligible for healthcare travel. Re you can file a reimbursement claim. Now, okay, I get that. But then it's saying the next steps telling you to file your claim. I'm not sure if you supposed to click on the first one? Or what? Alright, does that make sense?

- And so what's what's your interpretation of of the information in that number 2?
  > I would hope. Number yeah. Number 2 is good. You either file with receipts or just to travel. So if I was track, if I was just doing travel back and forth. you know, I'd hit the first one if the other one, if I had receipts and all that, I'd hit that that's fairly. It's the top one that's a little more confusing, because now it's saying. check your eligibility. Well, I wouldn't check my eligibility, because I know I'm getting, you know. I know I'm eligible. and I'm not sure what I'm not sure that would do what you would do if you hit that you supposed to hit that

- you can go ahead and try it.
  > Okay, it's just yeah. So ya, well that's taking into the same place. So I don't. You know what I mean? That's kinda double the thing right? So I if you hit that one, it's taking you down to the 2 and 3 which would be on the other one. Anyways, right? Is that correct? So I guess I guess that's fine. I don't know.

- Okay, but it sounds like the the information in the number one area, there is a little confusing.
  > Well, yeah. Because now, when you hit that, you go into what 2 and 3 said so. If I was, if once I seen it once, I would know not to hit the first one, I'd go just to the second one.
  > you know, I just wanna do as quick as I can go to the mileage travel. Only.

- And what about yeah? And what about the numbers that are listed there. What's your interpretation of those??
  > yeah, it's yeah. I don't. I don't know whether the 2 and the 3 are from the first one or from the second one, you know. I guess. Yeah. So I guess what. Now I'm looking at it more is it's the same. They're the same numbers. They just drop down menu on the first one. Right? That's what it is. Yeah. So II guess I guess I'm getting it now. It's just when I first looked at it was a little confusing. But now I'm getting that. That's just the dropdown menu for that, and it's the same numbers. So now I understand it.


- Is there anything else about this page that's confusing?
  > Nope looks good? Yep, looks pretty ex self explanatory.

- Is there anything missing that you'd expect to find on this page?
  > Well, I'm sure they'll be asking. I got there and all that stuff on the next. Once you once you do the claim. Yeah, I mean, I mean, you wouldn't be filling this out if you weren't taking your own car, I wouldn't imagine. But that's that's how that's what I do all the time. So it doesn't. You know what I mean?

- Go ahead and continue do what you would do next.
  > Okay, I hit this file a mileage. Only.

**Travel questions**

(quickly went through travel questions)
> okay, that makes sense. Yeah.
> So I'd be traveling my own vehicle as you travel from your home address. Yeah, that's very good. Yeah.

**Review page**

- Can you tell me about this page?
  > Yeah. The only thing I'm not really liking is it's not really telling yet. Give me an estimate of the mileage to where you're going, but I don't know if that would be what you would do here.
  > Okay, I see. So it's telling you, yeah, it's given the mileage and your own vehicle, and where you travel from  I guess it knows where you're going, too. Right? But it doesn't. It wouldn't, doesn't really give you a the mileage back and forth, you know.
  > But it is simple. I like that it is simple.
  > And then probably just go down here and confirm. confirm it and then submit it.

- Anything confusing about this page?
  > 

- Ok, go ahead and continue.

**Success page**

- Talk to me about this page and the information included here.
  > 

- Tell me about your understanding of what's happened to your claim.
  > 

- And how is this similar or different to what you expected?
  > 

- And did you notice this claim mentions 2 appointments?
  >

- And so why do you think that the second appointment is included here when you've gone through the process of filing just once?
  > 

- And would you expect that 2 appointments like that would be included in one process of a claim?
  >
  
-  And what would you expect to happen next with your claim?
  > 

- And if you still had questions right now, how would you find out more about your claim?
  > 

- Go ahead and and do that.

- So I'm curious. Where did you expect that link to take you? And is that different or the same as where it took you.
  > 

- So then, did you notice the review? Your past appointments link?
  > 

- Where did you expect that to take you?
 > 

-  Ok, let's try that.

**Past appointments page**

-  Is this where you expected to go?
  >

- Knowing that you're looking for the details page, how would you find that?
  > 

- Okay, do you wanna try that for the second one? Tell me about this page now and what you were expecting.

**Appointment details page that's been filed**


- What do you think that type of care not noted means?
  > 

- Overall on this page, can you tell me about what is most important for you here?
  > 

- And did you notice the travel reimbursement section there at the bottom?
 > 

- I know we came here to learn more about your status, is this what you expected to find?
  > 

- Okay. and where would you expect that link to go?
  > 

- Go ahead and select that link.
  > 
  

### Task #2: BTSSS status questions - 10 minutes

- Submitted for Payment
  > Submitted for payment means it was approved but it's waiting for payment.
 
- Payment Canceled
  > I would guess payment canceled for some reason they found a reason not to pay you, you know, when it came time for the payment. 
 
- Denied
  > For whatever reason they denied it. Whoever approves it denied it.

- Approved for Payment
  > It got approved. No problem. So you'd be expecting a payment.

- In Manual Review
  > And manual review means it's just in probably one of the layers that it has to go through before it gets approved.

- On Hold
  > There must be a reason it's gonna be on hold. You gotta probably look into that.

- Saved
  > It's saved. I don't know why that would be here, I mean, save just means they're not doing anything with it. They just saved it.

- Claim Paid
  > I would think that would be the same as approved for payment, although it's already been paid. After that so approve for payment is approved but I haven't been paid, and then claim paid means it has been paid.

- Incomplete
  > Incomplete means they need more information.

- Fiscal Rescinded
  > Yeah, I don't know what the hell that is, for some reason they they don't wanna pay you, whether you make too much money, or we're ineligible or what, I would guess. That's kind of a tough one.

- Claim Submitted
  > It's been submitted but hasn't been paid.

> Some of them are kind of similar to each other though, I think. Submitted for payment and claim submitted, I would say one and 11 are similar to each other.

> I don't know exactly what saved would be. Just that's not telling you much information, so let's see... incomplete and manual.

> And like, I say, the tenth one is kind of a crazy one. I don't understand exactly what that would mean.

> (Reason denied) That would probably be a good thing to put in there. You wouldn't know. You'd have to go back and look and see where where would do it. But if it's gave you a reason there, maybe that would help you.

> The only thing that's happened is they've paid me just for I thought not as much as they paid me before, so I really didn't know why. But there was no way really to find that out. I was telling you about paying you one way or whatever, but so they would pay you, and it seemed partial to me, but then was no way to really figure it out. So it wasn't that big of a deal, but it'd be too hard to go figure out.
