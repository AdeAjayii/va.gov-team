## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christina and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 
Today we're going to talk about filing travel reimbursement claims for your VA appointments. 
Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.

- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - _If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom._
   - _If yes: Admit observers._
   - _Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov._ 
   - _Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth_
- _(If applicable)_ **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.


- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help partners other staff at VA understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your on screen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
   - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
   - _If yes:_ **Once I start recording, I am going to once more confirm that you are okay with me recording this session and using a recorded clip from our discussion.**

_*Start recording.*_

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**

## Warm up questions: 3 minutes 
Before we go to the prototype, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
- Have you been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 6 months?
- Have you or a caregiver attempted to file for travel reimbursement for a VA or community care medical appointment  in the last 6 months? (Note: Could be either via paper form, BTSSS portal, or online check-in)
- What device are you using to join this session today?

- I will be sharing a web page link with you during this session. How would you prefer to receive the url? For example, I could send it through the Zoom (messages) chat or email it to you.

- _If the participant is using a screen reader:_
  - Are you using a screen reader or other assistive technology today? If so, what type? (For example, VoiceOver.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?


- _If the participant is using screen magnification:_
  - Are you using a screen magnification tool today? If so, what type? (For example, Zoom.)
  - And, how would you rate your level of experience with using that technology - beginner, intermediate, advanced or expert?
  - How long have you been using that technology?


- Great. Thank you.

## General travel questions: 5-10 minutes
We have a few different activities we’ll complete during this session. To start, I’ll ask you a few questions about your previous experience filing a travel reimbursement claim.

- Talk to me about the last time you filed a travel claim. Can you describe the steps for us, as well as your experience?  (What's the experience now?) 

- If you could wave a magic wand and make the travel reimbursement process how you’d want it, what would it be like?  (What’s the ideal situation?)

- And can you tell me a little about how you think about your travel reimbursement claims in relation to your other claims, such as [EXAMPLE]?


## Task #1: BTSSS status questions - 10 minutes

_**Note:** Use inclusive language as much as possible. If the participant is blind or low-vision, the moderator can still share their screen to help observers follow along, but explain this to the Veteran._

- Thank you! Now we’re going to go through some terms that relate to travel reimbursement claim statuses.
  
- This activity will help understand how Veterans, like you, are thinking about travel reimbursement claims at different steps in the submission and review process. If we can understand more about how you think of claim statuses, we can then present them in an expected and helpful way.
  
- I’ll be going through some words and phrases that represent different claim statuses you might have encountered in the past. You might recognize these from when you last filed a travel reimbursement claim.
  
- Ok, so if you’re ready (I’ll share my screen to help our observers follow along) and we’ll start with the first term. And remember, there are no right or wrong answers.

_Share screen with [slide deck of terms](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iIrZYINUNU-MzirNz54y_xH9VNyg4PeRXGbNe1dLn2I/edit?usp=sharing)_

_Complete the following with all 11 statuses:_

- Ok, so the (first/next/last) term is _____
  
  - What does this word/phrase mean to you in the context of the status of a travel reimbursement claim that you've filed?
    
  - Have you encountered this term before when filing for travel reimbursement?
    
  - Is there anything confusing about this term?
    - _(if appropriate/if the participant says they wouldn’t use that term)_ What would you call it instead?
      
  - How important is it for you to know this claim status during the travel reimbursement process?
 
_After going through all terms_

- Were there any other terms you expected to be here that were not included?

_When complete_

- Thank you! That concludes that activity. Now we’ll have you try out a prototype.
