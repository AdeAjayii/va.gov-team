# DRAFT Research Plan: Check-In (Veteran-Facing) Remote Discovery Research
## Goals
This research is to understand Veterans’ feelings, pain points, and value-gained by using the current ecosystem of check-in methods for medical appointments. There is a particular emphasis on the kiosk method, since it is being sunset.

## Background
Our goal is to improve the Veteran check-in process for medical appointments by providing a digital option.

## Research questions
- How do Veterans feel when interacting with each check-in method (focus heavily on kiosk workflows)?
- What are the Veteran-specified benefits for each method (focus heavily on kiosk workflows)?
- What are the Veteran-specified pain points for each method (focus heavily on kiosk workflows)?
- Do any particular kiosk workflow cause more confusion or pain points for Veterans than others? 

## Hypothesis & assumptions
TBD

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated test via Zoom using the Perigean contract. The Veterans will be asked a series of interview questions about their check-in experiences. Certain visuals will be presented in order to facilitate discussions on particular kiosk-based check-in workflows and methods.
