# Research Plan: Check-In (Veteran-Facing) Remote Discovery Research
## Goals
This research is to understand Veteransâ€™ feelings, pain points, and value-gained by using the current ecosystem of check-in methods for medical appointments. There is a particular emphasis on understanding the current kiosk method, because it is being replaced by a digital check-in solution on va.gov. However, feedback from all check-in methods will inform the digital check-in solution.

## Background
Our goal is to improve the Veteran check-in process for medical appointments by providing a digital option on va.gov.

## Research questions
- How do Veterans feel when interacting with each check-in method (focus heavily on kiosk workflows)?
  - How do Veterans feel about moving away from using kiosks?
  - How receptive are Veterans to utilizing other check-in methods?
- What are the Veteran-specified benefits for each method (focus heavily on kiosk workflows)?
- What are the Veteran-specified pain points for each method (focus heavily on kiosk workflows)?
  - Do any particular kiosk workflows cause more confusion or pain points for Veterans than others?
- How do non-sighted Veterans check-in?
  - What are their experiences with the current kiosk system?

## Hypothesis & assumptions
- The VA kiosks are a familiar, simple experience for Veterans. Experience with the other methods will vary.
- Authentication could be a pain point for Veterans within the new check-in workflow due to how they currently authenticate when using a kiosk.
- The kiosks are not accessible for Veterans, who are non-sighted.

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated test via Zoom using the Perigean contract. The Veterans will be asked a series of interview questions about their check-in experiences. Certain visuals will be presented in order to facilitate discussions on particular kiosk-based check-in workflows and methods.

## Participants and Recruitment
Recruit for 12 fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants
- All participants must have had at least one:
  - in-person medical appointment at a VA facility within the last 6 months.
  - in-person medical appointment at a VA facility before COVID.
- 6 participants must have used the kiosk to check-in at least once.
- At least 3 participants must have had a virtual appointment within the last 3 months.
- At least 3 participants must have experience checking-in via a VA staff member.
- At least 3 participants must have experience checking-in via a text message.
- 2 participated must be non-sighted users.

### Additional questions to ask in the screener
- Do you have a mobile phone or tablet?
  - If yes, what type?
- Do you use your phone to manage your health?
  - Do you manage any of your VA health benefits online?

### Good to have for participants

- At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater

### Recruitment requirements
