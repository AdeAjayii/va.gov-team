## Project-specific setup and Introduction (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kristen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.Today we’re going to discuss the process of checking into an appointment.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- The timing of this session may vary a little bit based upon your different experiences with check-in, but **this entire session will take no longer than an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Recording Instructions**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?”

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!
