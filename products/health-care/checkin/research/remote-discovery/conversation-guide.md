# Conversation Guide: Check-In (Veteran-Facing) Remote Discovery Research

## Moderator Logistics
- Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Before the session, send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).
- Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute.
- In the Audio section, tap the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro.

## Project-specific setup and Introduction (5 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kristen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.Today we’re going to discuss the process of checking into an appointment. This could be using the kiosk, talking directly with VA staff, using text messaging (we call it the “I am here” system), or how your access virtual appointments.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We just want to improve our tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- The timing of this session may vary a little bit based upon your different experiences with check-in, but **this entire session will take no longer than an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Recording Instructions**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?”

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm-up Questions - (5 minutes)
To get started, I’d like to get a little background information about you, and your experience with the VA.
- Do you manage any of your VA health benefits online?
  - What system do you use?
  - What types of health care information or capabilities do you most often interact with online?
  - When you are managing your benefits online, what device do you typically use?

  - If yes, 
    - What apps do you use? 
    - What do you use them for?

## General Scheduling and Check-In Experience (10 minutes)
Great, thank you. Now, we are going to start with some questions about the step before check-in, which is scheduling. Then, we’ll move into check-in questions.

_The blue questions maybe able to be cut for time purposes. Truthfully, this whole section may be able to be cut, so we can spend more time on each check-in method (the following sections). Or some of these questions can move to the Warm-up section._

- How many in-person appointments have you had since the beginning of the pandemic/COVID-19?
- Now, I’m going to ask you to think about your very last medical appointment that you actually went to the VA facility for.
- Do you recall how you scheduled your last medical appointment that you actually went to a VA location for, so not a virtual appointment? Did you go online, talk to someone in-person at the VA, call, etc?
  - Is that how you typically schedule in-person appointments?
  - Has your method for scheduling changed since COVID began?
