# DRAFT: Check-in Remote Discovery Research, April 2021
Discovery Readout <br/>
Lead researcher: Kristen McConnell, kristen.mcconnell@adhocteam.us

## Background and Goals

### Background
Our goal is to improve the Veteran check-in process for medical appointments by providing a digital option on va.gov.

This research is to understand Veterans’ feelings, pain points, and value-gained by using the current ecosystem of check-in methods for medical appointments. There is a particular emphasis on understanding the current kiosk method, because it is being replaced by a digital check-in solution on va.gov. However, feedback from all check-in methods will inform the digital check-in solution.

### Research Questions
- How do Veterans feel when interacting with each check-in method (focus heavily on kiosk workflows)?
  - How do Veterans feel about moving away from using kiosks?
  - How receptive are Veterans to utilizing other check-in methods?
- What are the Veteran-specified benefits for each method (focus heavily on kiosk workflows)?
- What are the Veteran-specified pain points for each method (focus heavily on kiosk workflows)?
  - Do any particular kiosk workflows cause more confusion or pain points for Veterans than others?
- How do non-sighted Veterans check-in?
  - What are their experiences with the current kiosk system?
    -We didn’t end up talking to any non-sighted Veterans.
    
### Hypotheses to be tested
- The VA kiosks are a familiar, simple experience for Veterans. Experience with the other methods will vary.
- Authentication could be a pain point for Veterans within the new check-in workflow due to how they currently authenticate when using a kiosk.
- The kiosks are not accessible for Veterans, who are non-sighted.

## Methodology

### Method and detailed research questions
We conducted 11 remote moderated tests via Zoom using the Perigean contract. The Veterans will be asked a series of interview questions about their check-in experiences. Certain visuals will be presented in order to facilitate discussions on particular kiosk-based check-in workflows and methods.

The complete conversation guide with all the detailed research questions asked can be found on the [VA’s GitHUB](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/remote-discovery/conversation-guide.md).

### Who we spoke with: 11 Veterans

**Gender**
Male: 10
Female: 1

**Age**
25-34: 3
45-54: 0
55-64: 1
65-74: 5
75 or older: 2

**Education**
Unknown: 2
Some college: 4
Associate’s/trade/vocational: 2
Bachelor’s: 3

**All participants must have had at least one:**
- in-person medical appointment at a VA facility within the last 6 months.
- in-person medical appointment at a VA facility before COVID.

We also looked for participants with a variety of experiences using different check-in methods, such as virtual appointments, kiosk, via a staff member, and text messaging. We were successful in talking to participants with experiences in all the methods except text messaging.<br/>

We did recruit non-sighted users, but they were all no shows to their research timeslots.

## Research Findings

### Key Findings
- Talking to VA staff members was the most preferred and used currently available check in method for in-person appointments.
- Checking in with a VA staff member can offer valuable human interactions for Veterans, but Veterans are sometimes made to feel unimportant or insulted during these interactions.
- Using a kiosk is quick and easy as long as the machine isn’t turned off or broken.
- When verifying their identity at the kiosk, more Veterans utilized their VHIC card than entered their SSN and date of birth.
- More participants received their medications by mail and used the kiosk to check in for lab tests than other methods.
- Talking to a staff member to update their contact or next of kin information was the most cited method.
- Kiosks were the most mentioned method to file for beneficiary travel mileage.
- Lab workflows vary from facility to facility. The most mentioned process was when the Veteran received a ticket, then the number on the ticket is called.
- For lab tests, digital check-in solutions are preferred, wait time vary, and sometimes orders are missing.
- Pharmacy workflows vary greatly from facility to facility.
- At the pharmacy, wait times are long, digital check-in solutions are preferred, and sometimes orders are missing.
- Most participants never updated their contact or next of kin information before. Even the participants who had experience updating this information talked about these tasks in a separate manner from check-in.
- Veterans have multiple options when filing for beneficiary travel mileage: kiosk, travel office, online, and automatic reimbursement.
- Veterans reported abandoning their attempts to file for travel mileage due to difficulties with multiple filing methods.
- Overall, checking in for virtual appointments was described as a pleasant and very quick experience.
- When asked about check-in experiences at other health care systems, Veteran unanimously wished those system had check in processes like the VA.
- Digital (particularly mobile phone solutions) and in-person options are both extremely valuable to different types of Veterans.
- Most Veterans were interested in a light-weight way of verifying their identity when checking in, such as the last 4 digits of their social security number and/or date of birth.
- Half of the participants were interested in receiving notifications letting them know that they could now check in.

### Talking to VA staff members was the most preferred and used currently available check in method for in-person appointments.
11 participants total.

- **In-person**
  - 7: preferred method
  - 11: have used

- **Kiosk**
  - 4: preferred method
  - 10: have used

- **Text Message**
  - 0: preferred method
  - 0: have used
  - (1 - heard about)

### Checking in with a VA staff member can offer valuable human interactions for Veterans, but Veterans are sometimes made to feel unimportant or insulted during these interactions.
**Benefits**
- Human interaction
  - “I like the human interaction, because I don’t get it elsewhere.”
- Friendly, familiar faces can help reduce anxiety
  - “If there is someone I know there, it helps bring my anxiety down, because I know them and they know me.” - Veteran with PTSD
- Can be short and to the point with only a few questions to answer

**Pain points**
- Bad customer service experiences (4 Veterans)
  - “They act like we are imposing...it is insulting and demeaning.”
  - “They seem to be on the phone all the time, so you stand and wait to ask questions.”
  - “Once in awhile they look around and see someone standing there, but they don’t do anything.”
  - “How they speak to people is condescending.”
- Lines/wait time to check-in

- A lot about Veterans just like to chat with these staff members.
- To add to the bad customer service experiences, some Veterans were redirected to the kiosk after waiting in line to talk to a staff member.
- Even 4 Veterans, who used a kiosk to check-in, reported that they approached a staff member for directions once done at the kiosk.
- Some Veterans were also mismatched to appointments and records.
  - A male Veteran was scheduled for an OBGYN appointment.
  - One Veteran was told that they didn’t have an appointment that day, but they went home and reviewed their reminders. They did have an appointment.
  - When checking-in it was determined the Veterans record was incorrect, their SSN was correct, but the name associated with the account was incorrect. 

### Using a kiosk is quick and easy as long as the machine isn’t turned off or broken. 
**Benefits**
- Quick and easy
  - “I don’t think it could be any easier.”
  - “It is quicker than standing in line.”
  - “It is idiot proof.”
- Don’t have to talk to someone

**Pain points**
- Are turned off or broken (4 Veterans)
- Directs the Veteran to talk to a staff member at the end after completing most of the screens (3 Veterans)
- Concern that the staff/providers don’t know they are waiting after checking-in
- Worried about entering personal information in a public area

Veterans who liked the kiosk did tend to be younger or more tech-savvy older Veterans.

- The above benefits and pain points apply to general kiosk usage and using the kiosk to check in for medical appointments, such as primary care or cardiology. 
  - Most of the Veterans who used the kiosks have seen the insurance screen and didn’t really have anything to say about it.
    - One Veteran did comment that they always have to see a staff member, because they mark that they have insurance through their work.

### When verifying their identity at the kiosk, more Veterans utilized their VHIC card than entered their SSN and date of birth.
9 participants total

- Used VHIC card: 6
  - It's easy.
  - "I have it on me; it's the only time I have ever used it."

- Entered SSN/DOB: 3
  - "I don't have a card."

One Veteran has used both methods.
