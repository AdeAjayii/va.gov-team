# DRAFT: Check-in Remote Discovery Research, April 2021
Discovery Readout <br/>
Lead researcher: Kristen McConnell, kristen.mcconnell@adhocteam.us

## Background and Goals

### Background
Our goal is to improve the Veteran check-in process for medical appointments by providing a digital option on va.gov.

This research is to understand Veterans’ feelings, pain points, and value-gained by using the current ecosystem of check-in methods for medical appointments. There is a particular emphasis on understanding the current kiosk method, because it is being replaced by a digital check-in solution on va.gov. However, feedback from all check-in methods will inform the digital check-in solution.

### Research Questions
- How do Veterans feel when interacting with each check-in method (focus heavily on kiosk workflows)?
  - How do Veterans feel about moving away from using kiosks?
  - How receptive are Veterans to utilizing other check-in methods?
- What are the Veteran-specified benefits for each method (focus heavily on kiosk workflows)?
- What are the Veteran-specified pain points for each method (focus heavily on kiosk workflows)?
  - Do any particular kiosk workflows cause more confusion or pain points for Veterans than others?
- How do non-sighted Veterans check-in?
  - What are their experiences with the current kiosk system?
    -We didn’t end up talking to any non-sighted Veterans.
    
### Hypotheses to be tested
- The VA kiosks are a familiar, simple experience for Veterans. Experience with the other methods will vary.
- Authentication could be a pain point for Veterans within the new check-in workflow due to how they currently authenticate when using a kiosk.
- The kiosks are not accessible for Veterans, who are non-sighted.

## Methodology

### Method and detailed research questions
We conducted 11 remote moderated tests via Zoom using the Perigean contract. The Veterans will be asked a series of interview questions about their check-in experiences. Certain visuals will be presented in order to facilitate discussions on particular kiosk-based check-in workflows and methods.

The complete conversation guide with all the detailed research questions asked can be found on the [VA’s GitHUB](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/remote-discovery/conversation-guide.md).

### Who we spoke with: 11 Veterans

**Gender**
Male: 10
Female: 1

**Age**
25-34: 3
45-54: 0
55-64: 1
65-74: 5
75 or older: 2

**Education**
Unknown: 2
Some college: 4
Associate’s/trade/vocational: 2
Bachelor’s: 3

**All participants must have had at least one:**
- in-person medical appointment at a VA facility within the last 6 months.
- in-person medical appointment at a VA facility before COVID.

We also looked for participants with a variety of experiences using different check-in methods, such as virtual appointments, kiosk, via a staff member, and text messaging. We were successful in talking to participants with experiences in all the methods except text messaging.

We did recruit non-sighted users, but they were all no shows to their research timeslots.

## Research Findings

### Key Findings
- Talking to VA staff members was the most preferred and used check-in method for in-person appointments.
- Checking-in with a VA staff member can offer valuable human interactions for Veterans, but Veterans are sometimes made to feel unimportant or insulted during these interactions.
- Using a kiosk is quick and easy as long as the machine isn’t turned off or broken.
- Kiosks can be used to…
  - check-in for medical appointments, lab tests, and pharmacy
  - update contact and next of kin information
  - file Beneficiary Travel Mileage

### Talking to VA staff members was the most preferred and used check-in method for in-person appointments.
11 participants total.

**In-person**
7 - preferred method
11 - have used

**Kiosk**
4 - preferred method
10 - have used

**Text Message**
0 - preferred method
0 - have used
(1 - heard about)

### Checking-in with a VA staff member can offer valuable human interactions for Veterans, but Veterans are sometimes made to feel unimportant or insulted during these interactions.
**Benefits**
- Human interaction
  - “I like the human interaction, because I don’t get it elsewhere.”
- Friendly, familiar faces can help reduce anxiety
  - “If there is someone I know there, it helps bring my anxiety down, because I know them and they know me.” - Veteran with PTSD
- Can be short and to the point with only a few questions to answer

**Pain points**
- Bad customer service experiences (4 Veterans)
  - “They act like we are imposing...it is insulting and demeaning.”
  - “They seem to be on the phone all the time, so you stand and wait to ask questions.”
  - “There are a lot of people standing around talking and it’s like they are more important than us.”
  - “How they speak to people is condescending.”
- Lines/wait time to check-in

- A lot about Veterans just like to chat with these staff members.
- To add to the bad customer service experiences, some Veterans were redirected to the kiosk after waiting in line to talk to a staff member.
- Some Veterans were also mismatched to appointments and records.
  - A male Veteran was scheduled for an OBGYN appointment.
  - One Veteran was told that they didn’t have an appointment that day, but they went home and reviewed their reminders. They did have an appointment.
  - When checking-in it was determined the Veterans record was incorrect, their SSN was correct, but the name associated with the account was incorrect. 

### Using a kiosk is quick and easy as long as the machine isn’t turned off or broken. 
**Benefits**
- Quick and easy
  - “I don’t think it could be any easier.”
  - “It is quicker than standing in line.”
  - “It is idiot proof.”
- Don’t have to talk to someone

**Pain points**
- Are turned off or broken (4 Veterans)
- Directs the Veteran to talk to a staff member at the end after completing most of the screens (3 Veterans)
- Concern that the staff/providers don’t know they are waiting after checking-in
- Worried about entering personal information in a public area

Veterans who liked the kiosk did tend to be younger or more tech-savvy older Veterans.

Digital and in-person options are both extremely valuable to different types of Veterans.

### Kiosks can be used to…
- check-in for medical appointments, lab tests, and pharmacy
- update contact and next of kin information
