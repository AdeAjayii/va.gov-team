# Planning On-site Research with Veterans at VA Medical Facilities

## How to set up on-site research
1. Create [research plan]. 
    - Include reasons why the research should be completed on-site and not remotely.
    - Read through the PRA overview and PRA primer documentation, then apply accordingly. Its implications depend upon what methodology you plan to use while on-site.
2. Share your research plan with your VA PO for approval and assistance with identifying contacts at the VA medical facilities.
    - Some sites have Quality Management Departments that can help you coordinate the day of your visit.
3. Begin communicating with your contract’s COR officer for travel approvals.
4. Begin communicating with the identified site contacts to determine:
    - What dates work best for both you and the site.
    - Who to ask for when your research group arrives at the site.
    - Where to go (if necessary) when arriving.
    - If a member of the research group does not have their PIV card yet, you must get approval from the site about whether that individual can travel to the site or not.
      - If the site approves, they will need to coordinate visitors passes for the research group member without a PIV card.
5. Once everything is approved by your contract’s COR and the sites, book travel. 

## Day of the research study
1. Wear your PIV card (possibly on the lanyard), so it is visible throughout your trip.
    - If you do not have a PIV card and were approved for a visitor’s pass, your first stop should be to pick up your visitor’s pass.

## Tips and recommendations
- If your methodology involves guerilla testing or intercepting Veterans, discuss the following with staff at each site before you begin your study:
  - Who does the initial intercept (you or staff)?
  - Should certain Veterans not be intercepted?

# Platform research documentation
[This site](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/) provides:
- detailed process information on remote and unmoderated studies. 
- a link to the research repo with all past studies. 
- links to the research plan and conversation guide templates. 
  - Interesting timing information from the research plan template:
    - If you are using Perigean to recruit please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote research, 2+ weeks for in person.
