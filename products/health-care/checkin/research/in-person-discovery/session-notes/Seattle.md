# Check In Experience On-Site Visit Summary
Seattle VAMC – 4/2/21

## Main Entrance Lobby (~10 minutes observations)
- Observed 2 people sitting in the area on their smart phones
- 2 travel benefit windows open
- Kiosks were divided into to areas – (1) main check in area and (2) 3 kiosks for post appointment tasks (e.g. check future appointments, travel benefits)
- No one was behind the main check in windows – the kiosks were available but no one behind the windows to help, it was dark
- No one was using the kiosks in the main lobby area when I was there
- Cellular coverage or guest WiFi appears to be good enough based on the two people sitting in the lobby (my iPhone automatically connected to VAMC network)

## Staff
- Steve Lee (oversees the kiosk) – primary contact for the Seattle VAMC visit
- New person that just joined Steve Lee’s team

- Women’s Clinic check in person
- West Clinic check in person
- Primary Care person

## Eye Clinic

- There is 1 -2 kiosks in the Eye Clinic
- The clinic was fairly empty… there was probably about 4 people waiting in the Eye Clinic
- There was son who was with his father and there was another veteran waiting
- Spoke to (1) veteran (was older) who was waiting for his appointment at the Eye Clinic by himself; his primary clinic is Silverdale
- Drove 75 miles (150 miles round trip) to come to Seattle for his eye appointment
- Had a little bit of fiasco with his most recent appointment
- Called to make appointment but no one called him back 
- He also mentioned the doctor he was seeing was not longer at the VA so he had to schedule appointment with a new eye doctor
- His appointment was accidentally cancelled because VA thought he was positive for COVID (actually he told them his son tested positive for COVID and they thought he tested positive). He did not find out that his appointment was cancelled until he got to the VA so it was frustrating since he had to drive 150 round trip.
- Used the kiosk to check in and did not have any issues; also have not had any issues with the kiosk in the past
- He does have a cell phone but he said he left it in his car so not sure they type of phone he had
- He sees the cell phone as only being used for emergencies
- He knew where to go because he has been to this VAMC before so he did not have any trouble finding where he needed to be
- Did not get a chance to finish the interview since he was called for his appointment

## Women’s Clinic
- Was moved from the front of the building and is now near the Eye Clinic
- There is only one kiosk for the Women’s Clinic
- No one was waiting in the area
- Spoke with Women’s Clinic staff member about check in process
- She often directs people to check in on the kiosks
- She did not have any issues with multiple screens – she has two screens she can use so she keep one screen for check in

## West Clinic 
- No one was in the waiting area – very quiet
- Spoke with staff member in the West Clinic
- 90% of the time it does not check people in all the way so she just ask patients to skip the kiosk and just come up to the window
- If there is a new clinic, it may never be properly added so it stops people from checking in
- After patient has been checked in, it prints out a “check-in sheet” for the nurses and it goes with the patient during their appointment
- “Kiosks are great if patients know where they are [in the building]”

## Primary Care

- Very empty. There was no one in the waiting area
- Spoke with one staff member
- The check in setup was different than the Eye Clinic and the West Clinic. They have a kiosk and a TV screen used for queuing patients who need assistance. On the kiosk menu screen, there is an option for “Need an appointment/assistance” Used for general questions and for patients who do not have an appointment at the clinics. 
- In the area, there is also a room for Labs and there is also a kiosk in front of the door to the Lab.
- Often times, they are helping patients find where they are supposed to be
- Sometimes, it would be simpler if they can just take a number at the entrance if they need help. They often just walk up to the window even though it was not their turn.


## Lab

- Very few people waiting in the waiting area
- 2 kiosks as you walk in and a TV screen close near the entrance to the different lab rooms so patients can see where they are in the queue and which lab room to go into
- Lab person has both VetLink open as well as VistA
  - Did not have any issues with multiple screens – looks like she mainly just used 2 (VetLink & VistA)
  - Like the information provided in VetLink – patient name, etc
  - Would like a simpler process – too many clicks – Call, With Staff, etc. this is because the patient often sees one person vs. multiple people if it was an appointment with a physician (first see nurse then the physician)

## Notes
- Seattle VAMC is not getting any more kiosks
- Planning to open 5 new CBOCs but not getting any new kiosks
  - Need to keep in mind when clinics open and close and how to address
- Tried using kiosks for COVID vaccine clinics but it did not work out so they stop using them almost immediately
- “I am here” is not being used by the Seattle VAMC
- Most staff members can’t think beyond the kiosk so no new ideas were generate on how to improve the check in process or using a different tool 
- The biggest issues I heard was veterans checking in on the wrong kiosks and they are sitting and waiting and may missed their appointment because they are at the wrong place - “Kiosks are great if patients know where they are [in the building]”
- There are generally two different process for us to account for (1) check -in for appointments and (2) check-in/queuing process for walk ins
