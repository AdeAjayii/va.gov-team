## Check In Experience On-Site Visit Summary
San Francisco VAMC – 4/22/21


## Staff
- Stephanie White Lawson, main SF contact
- SF guide, familiar with the kiosks and oversees them
- Radiology check-in person
- Labs – supervisor 
- Primary care check-in person
- Mental health – Advanced medical support assistant (check-in person)

## Notes
- Most of the specialties in the SF VA are in one building.
- Everyone visiting the SF VA must go through one entrance. It has a through white tent that Veterans walk through and staff usually walk around. Everyone must complete the covid screener and show it to staff members to enter.
- There is little to no kiosk use at the SF VA. We managed to find only one kiosk turn on (more on that below). My guide told me there were 45 kiosks, but all but one was turned off.
- Multiple specialties used to use the kiosks pre-pandemic, but once the pandemic started, specialties increasingly stopped using them.
- Guide says in the past few years 40-50% of the kiosks delivered there were non-functional, and very challenged to fix even when they got additional parts. Guide estimates that 4 years ago, only 5-10% of the kiosks had problems.
- The medical center was overall very empty. Many waiting rooms had nobody in them.
- My mobile coverage was good the whole time. My guide said sometimes it drops in a specific hallway.
- People I talked to were not familiar with ‘I am here’

## Travel Office
- There is a small travel office for travel reimbursement. The small space had multiple kiosks, but they were off and had signs referring veterans to a window.

## Radiology
- Kiosks were spun around, placed against the wall out of the way.
- Waiting areas were separate from radiology check-in. I didn’t go to them, but they said they space appointments to have no more than 3 people in a waiting room at a time.
- Check-in process: Every morning, they get the list of names of patients for the day. Then they print out a wristband for each patient in the morning. Patients come up to the window, show their card and provide their last four of their social security number.
- They liked their current check-in process.

## Labs
- Patients come in and present card and last four of their social security number. They then instructed the patient to wait for ~5-30 minutes.
- Sometimes there is a line that forms outside of the combined check-in/waiting area of people waiting to check in.
- There is some interest from staff to install a ticket based system, where numbers are called and then people are processed one at a time. However, due to the smallness of the enclosed area, the manager I spoke to did not think that would be helpful.

## Primary Care
- A number of turned-off kiosks along the side of the walls.
- The waiting room was by far the largest.
- Check-in person I spoke to had worked there only 4 months and had never seen the kiosks used.
- Check-in process: See a patient come in, ask for last 4, check-in on vista/cprs to see that they have an appointment the same day. Then check them in on vecna.
- Isn’t familiar with other check-in processes and thinks this process works well.
- Veterans don’t fill out paperwork, but they are handed a medical journal which is a piece of paper listing their medications that they can update with their provider.

## Mental Health
- This was the only clinic in a different building. It is across a small parking lot from the main building where all the other specialties I visited were.
- The door was locked and there was a sign on the door telling veterans to first check-in at the tent by the entrance to the main building. Then veterans bring their covid screener cleared sign to the door and they are let in.
- There was a kiosk powered off, and there was one kiosk that was on.
- The person I spoke to had only been there a year and had never seen anybody use kiosks to be checked in.
- They said the kiosk was used by one employee for travel purposes.
- For check-in, they use the last four digits of the social security numbers. There is no paperwork.
- They feel the process works fine.
