## Notes from a discussion with a VA employee (check in clerk)

There is a check-in clerk in one of the main kiosk/check-in areas, I was able to ask her a few questions.

- The clerks really like the kiosk, wish they were fully functional 7 days a week
- When they are out of order, must wait for them to be repaired/rebooted
- Once the Veteran has checked in at the kiosk, the clerk sees the status on her VetLink screen
- **She wishes there were a notification when the patient is signed into the wrong area**
- She has seen Veterans lined up 4-5 deep waiting to use the kiosk
- Magic wand? Currently there are 2 new clinics not configured to work with the kiosk so **the Veteran is seeing an incorrect error message**
- **I verified with David the kiosk manager that he is behind on his clinic set up--he wishes it were easier to do**
