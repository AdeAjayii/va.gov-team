## Intro
Hello. Thank you for joining the call today. My name is [name] and I'm a researcher on the mobile check-in team. I also have some colleagues on the line taking notes. Our research team is interested in understanding how the mobile check-in process has been working at your clinic and its impact on your job. As a result, we have a few questions for you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We just want to improve check-in to better meet Veteran's and your needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm, Are you confortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
