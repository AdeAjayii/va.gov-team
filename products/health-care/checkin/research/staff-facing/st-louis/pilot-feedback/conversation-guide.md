# Conversation Guide: St. Louis Visit to Gather Feedback on Pilot from Staff

## Upon arriving to the site, take notes about the setup of the clinic. 
_Particuarly important for the locations that we haven't visited yet._
- What type of care is provided?
- What does the area look like?
- How many MSAs/clerks are available in the clinic?
- What is the staff check-in process like?
- How is cellular service?

## Intro
Hello. My name is [name] and I'm a researcher on the patient check-in team. Our research team is interested in understanding how the new pre-check-in and check-in processes has been working at your clinic and their impact on your job. We are also looking for feedback on a couple of future features. As a result, I would like to observe you checking in Veterans and ask you a few questions if that is alright?

If no, ask if there is a better time to meet with them. Otherwise, **[end session.]**

If yes, continue...

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **We want to hear your honest opinions.** We just want to improve check-in to better meet Veteran's and your needs. I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to pause or stop, just let me know.** 

## Pilot Feedback Questions
- Things to watch for while observing staff:
  - Did they still engage and talk to Veterans who completed check-in on VA.gov?
    - Why?
  - What does the handoff from MSA to provider look like?

### Pre-check-in
- How has pre-check-in impacted checking in on the day the appointment? _Explain what pre-check-in is if need be._
- How has it impacted your work?
- How has it impacted the Veteran experience?
  - Have Veterans reported any specific pre-check-in feedback to you? If so, what was their feedback?
- Overall, what do you like about pre-check-in? 
- What do you dislike about it?
- On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this pre-check-in process be utilized at another VA clinic?

### Patient Check-in (Day of check-in)
- How has mobile check-in impacted your work?
  - Have you had to engage with or talk to Veterans who utilized mobile check-in before their appointment? If so, why?
  - How would you describe the impact of the changes to VSE-GUI (due to mobile check-in) on your work?
    - How often do you review the different check-in statuses within VSE-GUI? 
      - Are there any check-in statuses that you find more valuable to review than others?
  - Did you have to change anything else about your workflow to accommodate this new process?
    - How has mobile check-in affected communication between MSAs and providers?
      - _Probe more into the handoff/patient tracking process if necessary._
  - _For MSA Supervisors:_ How has this mobile check-in process affected your supervisory duties and how you balance your team?
- How has mobile check-in impacted the Veteran experience? 
  - Has it affected complaints about long waits/Veterans in the waiting room who have not actually been checked in?

    - How quickly have Veterans been receiving the check-in link after texting "checkin?"
- Overall, what do you like about mobile check-in?

- On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process be utilized at another VA clinic?
- What would you change about the new mobile check-in?

## Telemedicine Appointments
As we look toward future development, we would like to understand telemedicine appointments more.
- What is your current pre-registration process for telemedicine appointments?
- Are you experiencing any challenges with telemedicine appointments? If so, what are they?
- What is your ideal way to get pre-registration information from Veterans who have a telemedicine appointment?

## Patient Record Flags
We would also like to get your input on the use and value of patient record flags.
- How do you currently use patient record flags, if at all? 
- Where do you see the flag, and how do you respond?
- Do you use national or local flags, or both?
- If patient record flags were added to VSE for Clinical Staff, where/when would you want to see them? 
- Would you want only behavioral flags, or all patient flags?
- Is there any other patient information you would want to be alerted to that isn't already in VSE for Clinical Staff?

## Thank you
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us, so we can continue to improve Veteran and your experience. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!
