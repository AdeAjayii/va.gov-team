### Key Findings

- MSAs see value in allowing editing of demographic information in pre-check-in. 
- Some staff felt that the roll out lacked proper training. Based on our observations, staff would benefit from training on a variety of fronts. E.g., how to use Workflows, how to fix specific "hard stops" on Veteran side, when to check in Veterans themselves, etc. How staff were trained at each clinic seemed variable, which could also be a result of typical staff turnover. E.g., one clinic was not checking Veterans in who said they didnâ€™t want to use their phones.   
- Technical and network issues have been the root of some staff unhappiness, however most see the potential with check-in when those issues are resolved. 
- Staff had a variety of recommendations for VSE-CS, including more visual alerts, text box option for Workflow status, adding last 4 digits of SSN to patient record, ability to check Veterans in and filtering options, among a few others. 
- Some staff see value in adding patients flags to VSE-CS, while others are content with using CPRS. 
- Inconsistencies in how clinicians and clinics complete pre-registration with patients for telephone appointments.
