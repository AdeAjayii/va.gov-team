## Questions
- How has mobile CI impacted your work?
  - MSA 2: some challenges, if vets are not tech savvy, getting a good signal at the clinic is a barrier, delay in check-in process is causing PCP to run late
  - MSA 1: when they come to check in, message sometimes says to see us or update insurance; have to open up a different program to do the editing then get out and then patient has to go to phone to check in; can’t go into new VistA scheduling to do the updates; patient wants to know why they have to check in twice
  - MSA 2: same workflow as MSA 1
  - MSA 1: 
    - Some veterans don’t know how to text
    - Texting sometimes “sorry CI didn’t go through”
    - Live in a rural area so most people have land lines because cell doesn’t always have good signals
    - Some patients don’t want to use their cell miinutes to do the CI
    - When they get checked in up to a 10 minute delay to an LPN seeing that they have checked in and are ready to be seen
    - Fill out paperwork to say that the patient is here; not going well
  - Trainer:
    - Knows there is a delay, putting a chip in tonight and will see how will goes tomorrow; working on this delay
- What do you want to happen?
  - Want to edit through VSE
  - Want to be able to check the patient in w/o having to go back to their phones
- Are the statuses valuable? CI started, CI finished, hand offs for nursing
  - MSA 2: hit and miss; depends on how the system is running that day; after a patient checks in gets a popup; works when the system is running correctly
  - MSA 1: statuses are showing up on the screen; just can’t get everyone on board to do it (look at the statuses?)
  - MSA 1: statuses work; want to just click on the box and do what we need to do; don’t want to have to go to another application
  - MSA 2: agrees that would be helpful
- Are there statuses that are more valuable to review than others?
  - MSA 2: all statuses use pretty consistently
- Why else would you need to engage with the veteran as part of check in
  - MSA 1: some patients just need to speak to us about putting in a note about medication or records that they had a recent hospital visit
  - MSA 1: like using the kiosk for travel pay, now having to go back to paper
  - MSA 1: rural area has been tough; service providers for cell not as strong
  - MSA 2: in case they need paperwork for providers, things to discuss with provider, general scheduling
- Have you had to change anything else about your workflow to accommodate this process
  - MSA 2: have to have a clerk up there to walk them through it
  - MSA 1: need to have someone at the front door to check temp and give them a mask; front door stuff may go away
  - MSA 1: want to just check them in manually, don’t know why they have to do mobile check in
- Have communication been affected?
  - MSA 3: we love this system, patient’s love it because they can check in from their cars
- How has mobile check in affected veterans
  - MSA 3: some love it, some not; older vets not loving it until they get used to it; patient’s love being able to check in from their car; some complain about the new process but not a whole lot
  - MSA 2: handful say were not made aware of the change prior to coming in, felt blind sided and felt lost
  - MSA 1: agree, way out in the country and lot of them don’t like it and it’s really hard
- How quickly have veterans received the link after send check in text
  - MSA 1: some get them quickly and some don’t; maybe 10 seconds then longer to get the second one
  - MSA 2: some have older smart phone that take longer to load up
- Overall what do you like about the mobile CI experience
  - MSA 3: helps staff and veterans, like to check in before they get in the building; staff can look on the daily list and see who is already here; we love it here at North (orange?)  county
  - MSA 2: like the interface, cleaner than vet link was; see that most are just system problems; just lag now; see who’s supposed to come in that day, like to select “with nurse” etc.
- What’s the biggest thing you dislike
  - MSA 1: undecided
  - MSA 3: have no dislikes; thinks it was a good change; don’t have long lines at the desk or at the kiosk; works for us
  - MSA 2: the lag in the system
  - MSA 3: once patients and employees get comfortable
- Scale 0-10, how likely is it you would recommend other VA facilities use it
  - MSA 3: 10
  - MSA 2: 7
  - MSA 1: 6
- Anything else on your list Melissa that we didn’t cover
  - MSA 1: covered everything
- Anything else you would do to improve?
  - LPN: better our internet service; as soon as you are in the building cell service disappears

## Feedback on patient flags
- How do you use them?
  - MSA 2: rarely deal with them and only behavioral flags
  - MSA 1: want VA to change their check in to include last name and birth date as input because they can’t ask for last 4
  - MSA 3: look in VistA scheduling, rarely come across any
- Are they national or local
  - MSA 2: garbled
- If we add these, where and when would you want to see them (what point in the workflow)
  - MSA 2: affect how we interact with the veteran (high risk for suicide)
-  Where does this popup in the current UI
  - MSA 2: go into CPRS, will be a popup, have to click ok
  - MSA 2: VSE will show up in the comments or special needs; can’t miss it
  - MSA 2: like the way it is, getting a popup helps so that you are aware
- Any other patient info you would want to be alerted to that isn’t in VSE?
  - No answer
- Anything else we need to know
  - MSA 2: can’t think of anything to add
