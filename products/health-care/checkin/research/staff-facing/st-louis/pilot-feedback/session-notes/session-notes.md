## Pre-Check-In

**How has pre-check-in impacted check-ins on the day of appointments?**

North County CBOC (Primary Care, etc.) 

MSA 1: Some do. Some don’t. She thinks veterans think pre-check-in is check-in.<br>
MSA 2: Many of the older veterans do not use pre-check-in. 

**How has the pre-check-in process impacted your work?** 

MSA 1: Internet goes down a lot. May have to stop and train veteran. Pre-check-in text is too long. Veterans don’t read the whole thing and therefore don’t know what pre-check-in is.<br>
MSA 2: Pre-check-in process hasn’t really affected her work. She enjoys seeing the veteran being successful with e-check-in.

**Has pre-check-in impacted the veteran experience?** 

MSA 1: She has VS GUI for scheduling, Vista for updating patient info, VSECS for workflow updates, and VetLink for labs all running.<br>
MSA 2: A lot of veterans think it is difficult. She did not elaborate as to why.
