### Pre-Check-In

**How has pre-check-in impacted check-ins on the day of appointments?**

MSA 1: Some do. Some don’t. She thinks veterans think pre-check-in is check-in.<br>
MSA 2: Many of the older veterans do not use pre-check-in. <br>
MSA 3: Check-ins are slow. Vets don’t have phone or don’t know what to do.<br>
MSA 4: Work has increased. They get yelled at by patients. It is difficult and takes too long. The veteran shouldn’t have to use a phone.

**How has the pre-check-in process impacted your work?** 

MSA 1: Internet goes down a lot. May have to stop and train veteran. Pre-check-in text is too long. Veterans don’t read the whole thing and therefore don’t know what pre-check-in is.<br>
MSA 2: Pre-check-in process hasn’t really affected her work. She enjoys seeing the veteran being successful with e-check-in.<br>
MSA 3: n/a<br>
MSA 4: Extra work assisting veterans with e-check-in.

**Has pre-check-in impacted the veteran experience?** 

MSA 1: She has VSE-GUI for scheduling, Vista for updating patient info, VSE-CS for workflow updates, and VetLink for labs all running.<br>
MSA 2: A lot of veterans think it is difficult. She did not elaborate as to why.<\br>
MSA 3: Some veterans say it is easy and convenient. Others are lost don’t understand what pre-check-in is.<br>
MSA 4: Extra work assisting veterans with e-check-in.

**On a scale of 1 to 10, where 0 is not at all likely, how likely is it that you’d recommend the pre-check-in process to another VA clinic or facility.**

MSA 1: 7<br>
MSA 2: 9<br>
MSA 3: n/a<br>
MSA 4: 7 if the veteran does pre-check-in, it saves the MSA time.

### Check-In

**How has mobile check in impacted your work?**

MSA 1: She gets interrupted some days more than others to assist veterans with using e-check-in.<br>
MSA 2: She feels like the e-check-in process works well. I did observe her assist veterans with the mobile check-in process when she observed them having trouble and also when they just came straight to the front desk to check-in.

Notes: Both MSA 1 and MSA 2 actively asked the veterans who came to the desk to check in if they had their smartphone and walked the veterans through the check-in process. MSA 1 and MSA 1 both feel like getting to know the veteran and assisting them improves the veterans experience and makes them feel more comfortable when visiting their practice/clinic.

MSA 3: Work has increased with having to assist the veterans with the e-check-in process.<br>
MSA 4: Work has increased. Would like med sheet (patient summary?) to automatically print on e-check-in. She would like the vet to be able to check in on any phone not just one that is associated with the veteran’s record stored in VistA. Would like to be able to check the patient in with VSE-CS.

**Have you had to engage with or talk to Veterans who are using the mobile check-in? Why?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: She likes to double check to ensure the veteran checked in successfully.<br>
MSA 3: Yes. She has to assist the veteran with how to do e-check-in.<br>
MSA 4: n/a

**How would you describe the impact of the changes to VSE GUI to your work?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: It has impacted her work for the better. But negatively impacts her work when the system is slow.<br>
MSA 3: She likes it. It is easy and convenient. It makes her work easier.<br>
MSA 4: n/a

**How often do you review the different check-in statuses within VSE-GUI?**

MSA 1: Every 3 minutes or so.<br>
MSA 2: All day long every few minutes.<br>
MSA 3: Every few minutes throughout the day.<br>
MSA 4: n/a

**Are there any check-in statuses in VSE-GUI that you find more helpful than others?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: No.
MSA 3: No. 
MSA 4: No. 

**Did you have to change anything else about your work to accommodate the new mobile check-in and VSE-GUI process?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: In the beginning she had to organize the check-in steps in her mind proactively to avoid workflow errors.<br>
MSA 3: They print the appointment list from VistA because when they first started using VSE-CS, they system was crashing. The kiosk would print a routing sheet for the patient at check-in. Now they have to manually complete the routing sheet.<br>
MSA 4: Constantly has to go into the hall to help someone check-in.

**How has mobile check-in affected communication between the MSAs and providers?**

MSA 1: Still talk to providers. No change in communication. Inconsistent app up/down for individuals due to technical issues (network issues, lag in updating workflow status changes). Providers will IM asking if their patient is here.<br>
MSA 2: No change.

**Has mobile check-in affected the Veteran experience? If so, how?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: No change.<br>
MSA 3: Frustrates the veterans that don’t want to do it. The more tech savvy veterans like it.<br>
MSA 4: More veterans dislike it. Only about 20% of their patients like it.

**Have Veterans reported any specific check-in feedback to you?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: No.<br>
MSA 3: It is inconvenient. They have to learn something new. They just want to get checked in and don’t want to use their own phone. If the government wants them to check-in with a phone then the government should provide a phone to the veteran.<br>
MSA 4: Veterans would like to be forewarned about the new process of e-check-in.<br>
MSA 5: Extra work assisting veterans with e-check-in. It is difficult because clinic is beneath the X-ray department and cellular service is spotty in this location.

**Do you know how quickly they’ve been receiving the check-in link after texting “check-in”?**

MSA 1: Varies based on system response up to 5 minutes.<br>
MSA 2: About 2 seconds.

**Has it made an impact on complaints about long wait times? Or impacted the number of Veterans in the waiting room who haven’t been checked in?**

MSA 1: Improved when the system is functioning adequately.<br>
MSA 2: If the Veteran comes in right before their appointment the wait is longer because they have learn how to do e-check-in which is a new process for them.<br>
MSA 3: It has increased older veteran’s frustration. Younger veterans have fewer complaints.<br>
MSA 4: Some vets turn around and go home and don’t even try and won’t check in with the MSA. When they have a chance to help the veteran, he is already gone.

**Overall, what do you like about the check-in?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: Teaches non-tech savvy. Everyone is equal and can do it.<br>
MSA 3: Pre-check is already completed by the veteran.

**What do you dislike about it?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: Nothing.<br>
MSA 3: Vets don’t want to learn something new.<br>
MSA 4: e-check-in should not be in the eye clinic. The veteran is coming there because they can’t see.

**What would you change about it?**

MSA 1: Shorten text messages.<br>
MSA 2: Sometimes the process is very slow.

### Telemedicine - Phone Appointments 

**Do any, or all, of the providers at this practice/clinic use phone appointments for Veterans?**

MSA 1: Yes – primary care<br>
MSA 2: All of the providers do phone appointments. They encourage face to face or VVS appointments. She puts the patient’s preference first.
MSA 3: n/a<br>
MSA 4: No. 

**What type of appointments can be scheduled for phone?**

MSA 1: Primary care. Consults do not use phone appointments. Physical Therapy does not do phone appointments. New patients are seen face to face.<br>
MSA 2: New patients do not get scheduled for phone appointments.

**What is the pre-registration process for phone appointments?**

MSA 1: May call before or after the appointment to pre-register the patient. It depends on how busy they are at the desk.<br>
MSA 2: She didn’t seem to understand pre-check-in. Her answers were as if I asked about e-check-in.

**Is that process different from in-person or video visits?**

MSA 1: No. The process is the same.<br>
MSA 2: No. The process is the same.

**Are there any existing challenges with scheduling or conducting phone appointments?**

MSA 1: No, not as long as the system is functioning adequately.<br>
MSA 2: No.

**What would be the ideal way to do pre-registration with patients who have a phone appointment?**

MSA 1: No change.<br>
MSA 2: No change.

**And what about for video visits?**

MSA 1: No change as long as the system is functioning adequately.<br>
MSA 2: No change.

### Patient Record Flags

**How do you currently use patient record flags, if at all?**

MSA 1: What is a patient record flag? VS GUI – sometimes is going so fast they don’t look at the flags. Not many veterans at this practice/clinic have patient flags. MSAs know who the patients are and their needs.<br>
MSA 2: Doesn’t use patient flags.

Nurse 1: They see the patient flag pop ups and acknowledge them and act on the flags accordingly. <br>
Nurse 2: They see the patient flag pop ups and acknowledge them and act on the flags accordingly. 

**Where do you see the flag and how do you respond?**

MSA 1: VS GUI. Usually they breeze past them since the know their patient and their patient’s needs.<br>
MSA 2: n/a

Nurse 1: They see the patient flags in CPRS. They acknowledge the flags and act on them accordingly.<br>
Nurse 2: They see the patient flags in CPRS. They acknowledge the flags and act on them accordingly.<br>
Nurse 3: They see the flags in CPRS, acknowledge them and act on them accordingly.

**Do you use national or local flags? Both?**

MSA 1: Doesn’t know the difference. They use behavioral flags.<br>
MSA 2: n/a

Nurse 1: Both. <br>
Nurse 2: Both. <br>
Nurse 3: Both. 

**If patient record flags were added to VSE for Clinical Staff, where/when would you want to see them?**

MSA 1: VSECS on the appointment list screen. She expressed she doesn’t want a pop-up. She prefers it be an indicator on the screen, maybe an info button with hover text.<br>
MSA 2: An indicator by the patient’s name.

Nurse 1: Would like an indicator by the patient name in VSE-CS.<br>
Nurse 2: Yes, patient flags in VSECS would be helpful.<br>
Nurse 3: Patient flags are not useful in VSECS. If flags are implemented she would like to see an indicator by the patient name or a new column. The flag should pop up when patient checks in.

**Would you want only behavioral flags or all patient flags?**

MSA 1: Behavioral.<br>
MSA 2: n/a

Nurse 1: All. <br>
Nurse 2: All. <br>
Nurse 3: All. 

**Is there any other patient information you would want to be alerted to that isn’t already in VSE for Clinical Staff?**

MSA 1: Patient needs like wheelchair, low vision, etc would be helpful.,br>
MSA 2: None.

Nurse 1: Difficult for nurses to see what they need. They have an eye tech but there is no “eye tech” or “other” in the workflow options drop down list.<br>
Nurse 2: Last 4 of SSN would be helpful. Would like to see all alerts. Allowing check-in for multiple appointments is a problem because the patient may be in another clinic or location, not in the eye clinic. She would like the ability to assign the workflow to a specific user so the provider knows which nurse to look for to find the patient instead of having to track down each nurse individually to locate the patient.<br>
Nurse 3:  Last 4 SSN. Alert of status changes – highlight the row. Workflow is ok.

### Appointment Notifications

**What tools or messages are used for this type of communication with Veterans?**

MSA 1: Phone call and letter.<br>
MSA 2: Nurse’s do this.

**Are there any challenges you run into with using or managing these tools/messages?**

MSA 1: Incorrect patient phone numbers or addresses in VistA.<br>
MSA 2: n/a

**Are you currently capturing health information from patients before an appointment? If so, how is that information captured?**

MSA 1: MSAs do not do this. Nurses do this.<br>
MSA 2: n/a

Are any other systems used to communicate with patients?
MSA 1: Letters, phone calls, texts, My HealthEVet email.

### Observations

**North County CBOC**

MSA 1 and MSA 2 were very positive about the pre-check-in, e-check-in experience. They expressed that they takes the time to train the Veteran rather than just checking them in. They do this in a positive way stressing that it will be much easier for the veteran the next time they come in.

Staff expressed they would like to see indicators like sounds, colors (highlighting), or flashing to indicate the screen has refreshed and there is new information.

The most common complaint received from everyone is that cellular service is not good in most locations. The second most common complaint is technical issues where there is lag or the system is down for everyone or just certain individuals.

Staff engaged with almost every Veteran. They acknowledged nearly every veteran regardless of their method of check-in. They believe in being friendly and engaging the veterans.

The only improvement suggestion that MSA 2 had was to improve the speed and responsiveness of the application.
