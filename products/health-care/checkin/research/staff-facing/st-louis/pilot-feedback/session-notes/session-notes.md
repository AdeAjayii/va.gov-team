### Pre-Check-In

**How has pre-check-in impacted check-ins on the day of appointments?**

MSA 1: Some do. Some don’t. She thinks veterans think pre-check-in is check-in.<br>
MSA 2: Many of the older veterans do not use pre-check-in. 

**How has the pre-check-in process impacted your work?** 

MSA 1: Internet goes down a lot. May have to stop and train veteran. Pre-check-in text is too long. Veterans don’t read the whole thing and therefore don’t know what pre-check-in is.<br>
MSA 2: Pre-check-in process hasn’t really affected her work. She enjoys seeing the veteran being successful with e-check-in.

**Has pre-check-in impacted the veteran experience?** 

MSA 1: She has VSE-GUI for scheduling, Vista for updating patient info, VSE-CS for workflow updates, and VetLink for labs all running.<br>
MSA 2: A lot of veterans think it is difficult. She did not elaborate as to why.

**On a scale of 1 to 10, where 0 is not at all likely, how likely is it that you’d recommend the pre-check-in process to another VA clinic or facility.**

MSA 1: 7<br>
MSA 2: 9

### Check-In

**How has mobile check in impacted your work?**

MSA 1: She gets interrupted some days more than others to assist veterans with using e-check-in.<br>
MSA 2: She feels like the e-check-in process works well. I did observe her assist veterans with the mobile check-in process when she observed them having trouble and also when they just came straight to the front desk to check-in. <br><br>
Notes: Both MSA 1 and MSA 2 actively asked the veterans who came to the desk to check in if they had their smartphone and walked the veterans through the check-in process. MSA 1 and MSA 1 both feel like getting to know the veteran and assisting them improves the veterans experience and makes them feel more comfortable when visiting their practice/clinic.

**Have you had to engage with or talk to Veterans who are using the mobile check-in? Why?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: She likes to double check to ensure the veteran checked in successfully.

**How would you describe the impact of the changes to VSE GUI to your work?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: It has impacted her work for the better. But negatively impacts her work when the system is slow.

**How often do you review the different check-in statuses within VSE-GUI?**

MSA 1: Every 3 minutes or so.<br>
MSA 2: All day long every few minutes.

**Are there any check-in statuses in VS GUI that you find more helpful than others?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: No.

**Did you have to change anything else about your work to accommodate the new mobile check-in and VSE-GUI process?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: In the beginning she had to organize the check-in steps in her mind proactively to avoid workflow errors.

**How has mobile check-in affected communication between the MSAs and providers?**

MSA 1: Still talk to providers. No change in communication. Inconsistent app up/down for individuals due to technical issues (network issues, lag in updating workflow status changes). Providers will IM asking if their patient is here.<br>
MSA 2: No change.

**Has mobile check-in affected the Veteran experience? If so, how?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: No change.

**Have Veterans reported any specific check-in feedback to you?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: No.

**Do you know how quickly they’ve been receiving the check-in link after texting “check-in”?**

MSA 1: Varies based on system response up to 5 minutes.<br>
MSA 2: About 2 seconds.

**Has it made an impact on complaints about long wait times? Or impacted the number of Veterans in the waiting room who haven’t been checked in?**

MSA 1: Improved when the system is functioning adequately.<br>
MSA 2: If the Veteran comes in right before their appointment the wait is longer because they have learn how to do e-check-in which is a new process for them.

**Overall, what do you like about the check-in?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: Teaches non-tech savvy. Everyone is equal and can do it.

**What do you dislike about it?**

MSA 1: n/a<br>
MSA 2: Nothing.

**What would you change about it?**

MSA 1: Shorten text messages.<br>
MSA 2: Sometimes the process is very slow.
