### Pre-Check-In

**How has pre-check-in impacted check-ins on the day of appointments?**

North County CBOC (Primary Care, etc.) 

MSA 1: Some do. Some don’t. She thinks veterans think pre-check-in is check-in.<br>
MSA 2: Many of the older veterans do not use pre-check-in. 

**How has the pre-check-in process impacted your work?** 

MSA 1: Internet goes down a lot. May have to stop and train veteran. Pre-check-in text is too long. Veterans don’t read the whole thing and therefore don’t know what pre-check-in is.<br>
MSA 2: Pre-check-in process hasn’t really affected her work. She enjoys seeing the veteran being successful with e-check-in.

**Has pre-check-in impacted the veteran experience?** 

MSA 1: She has VSE-GUI for scheduling, Vista for updating patient info, VSE-CS for workflow updates, and VetLink for labs all running.<br>
MSA 2: A lot of veterans think it is difficult. She did not elaborate as to why.

**On a scale of 1 to 10, where 0 is not at all likely, how likely is it that you’d recommend the pre-check-in process to another VA clinic or facility.**<br>
MSA 1: 7<br>
MSA 2: 9

### Check-In

**How has mobile check in impacted your work?**

MSA 1: She gets interrupted some days more than others to assist veterans with using e-check-in.<br>
MSA 2: She feels like the e-check-in process works well. I did observe her assist veterans with the mobile check-in process when she observed them having trouble and also when they just came straight to the front desk to check-in. <br><br>
Notes: Both MSA 1 and MSA 2 actively asked the veterans who came to the desk to check in if they had their smartphone and walked the veterans through the check-in process. MSA 1 and MSA 1 both feel like getting to know the veteran and assisting them improves the veterans experience and makes them feel more comfortable when visiting their practice/clinic.
