# Research Plan for Mobile Check-in Pilot Feedback from St. Louis Staff
February 2022

## Goals
### What product & team are you doing this research for?
VSA Healthcare Experience: Check-in

### Background:
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. The healthcare experience team in particular will be creating the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via VA.gov. With this round of research, we are looking to get feedback on the pilot release from staff.

### Research questions:
- After a Veteran utilizes the new mobile check-in solution, are they called back for their appointment without having to talk to a clerk/Medical Support Assistant (MSA)?
- What is the impact to the staff workflow when Veterans check in on their mobile phones?
- How do Veterans and staff feel about the mobile check-in solution?

### Hypotheses:
- The Veterans will successfully check in via their mobile phone, because the clerk and clincial staff will know the Veteran is in the waiting room without needing to speak directly to them. As a result, a nurse or other clinical staff will call the Veteran back for their appointment without first talking to an MSA/clerk.
- Clerks/MSAs should have shorter lines of Veterans waiting to check in, since Veterans will utilize this solution. They shouldn't need to speak directly to the Veterans who check in via their mobile phones, in order for the clinical staff to know the Veteran has arrived for their appointment. The impact to their in-person Veteran check in (Veteran's who choose not to utilize the mobile check-in solution) workflow may vary depending upon their current workflows.
- There should be minimal to no impact to clinical staff's workflow on how they know a Veteran has arrived for their appointment. 
- Veteran and staff responses will indicate that the mobile phone check-in solution is useful and does not negatively impact experience or clinical workflow.

### Methodology and Recruitment
- During a one hour Zoom call with the pilot clinics(s), we will interview staff members that are utilizing the new VA.gov check-in solution. Product is setting up recurring office hour meeting with the site(s), so we can utilize one or more of these meetings for this research. Ideally, we would like to talk to MSAs and MSA Supervisors at each site/clinic once.

### When? What dates do you plan to do research?
- To be determined. Coordination with St. Louis location(s) needed. Try to run this staff feedback session 1 - 2 weeks after launching the pilot.
