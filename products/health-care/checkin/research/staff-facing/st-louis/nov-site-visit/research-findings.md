# St. Louis Research Visit Nov. 2021

Researchers: Kristen McConnell (kristen.mcconnell@adhocteam.us) and Julie Adair (julie.adair@agile6.com)

## How this research maps to the Veteran journey
- It is part of "Living civilian life" and  "Taking care of myself," specifically this product allows Veterans to check in for a VA medical appointment with their mobile phone.

## OCTO-DE goals that this research supports
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Measures to increase
  - Completion rate of online transactions
  - Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Measures to decrease
  - Time to successful complete and submit online transactions

## Background and Methodology
### Background
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. One portion of the ecosystem enables Veterans to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via va.gov. Another portion, called pre-check-in, allows the Veteran to complete a series of tasks, in order to prepare for their appointment, a few days before the appointment.

With this round of research, we were looking to understand the current check-in workflows at the Franklin County VA Clinic in Washington, Missouri, which is the proposed next pilot site for the product. We also wanted to get feedback on pre-check-in, pre-registration, and staff indicators/alerts. Once we arrived onsite, we were invited by the MSA Supervisor to visit St. Charles County VA Clinic in O’Fallon, Missouri.

The complete [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/nov-site-visit/conversation-guide.md) utilized at both locations as well as the [notes from the visit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/nov-site-visit/visit-notes.md) can be found on VA’s GitHub.

### Methodology
- At Franklin County VA Clinic, we conducted interviews with and observed the following staff:
  - 3 Medical Support Assistants (MSA)
  - 1 MSA Lead
  - 1 MSA Supervisor (same person as St. Charles County)
  - 1 Clinic Manager
- We also observed a few Veterans checking in on a kiosk as staff assisted them. We did not engage Veterans or ask them questions.

- At St. Charles County VA Clinic, we conducted interviews with and observed the following staff:
  - 3 MSAs
  - 1 MSA Lead (very briefly)
  - 1 MSA Supervisor (same person as Franklin County)
  - 1 Clinic Manager

### About Frankline County VA Clinic
- One waiting room for 3 primary care providers and 9 other specialties, such as physical therapy and labs.
- An hour away from the main St. Louis VAMC, not super close to other VA locations, and in a more rural location.

### About St. Charles County VA Clinic
- One waiting room for 4 primary care providers and 9 other specialties, such as physical therapy and labs.
- A larger, younger and more tech-savvy patient population than Franklin with better cell reception and closer to St. Louis.

## Key Findings
### Patient Tracking
- Franklin utilizes VetLink and Teams messages to notify clinical staff that Veterans have arrived. St. Charles mostly used VetLink for these notifications and sent Teams messages as an extreme back-up.
- St. Charles utilizes VetLink statuses throughout the entire appointment.
- MSAs requested visual alerts be added to the new check-in solution. They want the alerts to remain on the screen until they are acknowledged.
- Clinic managers are interested in understanding how long it takes a Veteran to go through each stage of an appointment.

### Pre-registration, Pre-check-in, and Statuses for Staff 
- Franklin and St. Charles MSAs don’t update permanent addresses for Veterans. Phone, email, next of kin and emergency contact changes are most often made if the Veteran requests them.
- MSAs do not have a way to determine a Veteran’s preferred phone number.
- Pre-check-in may occur at the same time as other appointment notifications, such as phone calls from LPNs. Staff commented that Veterans already receive too many appointment notifications, thus they ignore them.
- All staff found it valuable to know when a Veteran completed pre-check-in, started check-in, and completed check-in via mobile check-in. They also wanted to know if they needed to review demographic or insurance information with the Veteran.

### Printing
- A routing sheet/cover sheet and medication list automatically print when a Veteran checks in. The MSA’s workload greatly increases when this printing capability isn’t working. The routing sheet serves multiple purposes for both the Veteran and provider.

### Pilot Site Location Feedback
- The MSA Supervisor and Clinic Manager suggested that St. Charles might be a better pilot site due to better cell reception and a younger/more tech-savvy patient population.

## Detailed Research Findings
### Patient Tracking
**Franklin utilizes VetLink and Teams messages to notify clinical staff that Veterans have arrived. St. Charles mostly used VetLink for these notifications and sent Teams messages as an extreme back-up.**
- Most specialists and LPNs monitor VetLink; clinical staff do not have access to VSE GUI.
  - Some providers still periodically check the waiting room to see if a Veteran arrived.
- When Teams messages were sent, they were sent to a channel with everyone in the clinic.
- Some Teams messages were also sent to coordinate next steps, such as letting the MSA know a Veteran needs to schedule a follow-up appointments.

**St. Charles utilizes VetLink statuses throughout the entire appointment.**
- The clinical staff will mark that the Veteran is with the nurse or done within VetLink.

**MSAs requested visual alerts be added to the new check-in solution. They want the alerts to remain on the screen until they are acknowledged.**
- The current Teams messages get lost due to interruptions and multiple messages coming in at once.
- Due to phone calls and other noises, some of the currently existing audible alerts have been missed.
- Due to utilizing multiple applications, overseeing multiple clinics, and dealing with constant interruptions, MSAs want the alert to stay up until it is acknowledged. They worry the alert might be missed otherwise.

**Clinic managers are interested in understanding how long it takes a Veteran to go through each stage of an appointment.**
- They mentioned the following time intervals to be of interest:
  - time when the Veteran arrives.
  - time when the nurse calls them back.
  - time when the doctor/provider starts to see them.
  - time when the Veteran checks out.
