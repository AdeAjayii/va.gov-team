## Background and Methodology
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. One portion of the ecosystem enables Veterans to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via va.gov. Another portion, called pre-check-in, allows the Veteran to complete a series of tasks, in order to prepare for their appointment, a few days before the appointment.

With this round of research, we were looking to understand the current check-in workflows at the Franklin County VA Clinic in Washington, Missouri, which is the proposed next pilot site for the product. We also wanted to get feedback on pre-check-in, pre-registration, and staff indicators/alerts. Once we arrived onsite, we were invited by the MSA Supervisor to visit St. Charles County VA Clinic in O’Fallon, Missouri.

The complete conversation guide utilized at both locations as well as the notes from the visit can be found on VA’s GitHub.
