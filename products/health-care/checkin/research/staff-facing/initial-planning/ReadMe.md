## Overview of Staff Discovery for Check-In & Clinic Workflow Management
Early planning documents for researching staff-facing check-in and clinical workflow management (currently provided by VetLink). 
Last updated: May 19, 2021
## Goal
Understand breadth and depth of staff experience for both patient check-in and clinic workflow management to inform new check in product for appointments and walk-in services.

## Background
Current software and hardware for check-in kiosks is being moved away from in the next 12 months. Staff rely on these tools to manage patients who are onsite for appointments and walk-in services, and to communicate with other staff asynchronously. 

## Recruiting Overview
For site visits and staff interviews, sample should represent VAMCs and CBOCs that are urban, rural, from all regions (NE, SE, SW, NW, NC, SC), varied satisfaction ratings, VAMCs, CBOCs, variation in kiosk usage. More details forthcoming.

## Methods, Goals & Research Questions
### Semi-Structured Interviews 
Understand depth of staff experience, pain points, needs, and attitudes across roles, regions, site qualities (ie tool usage, rural/urban, low/high satisfaction rating).
#### Possible Research Questions
*	What is the staff experience of check-in, patient tracking?
*	What are pain points for staff for check-in, patient tracking?
*	What are the admin-level needs being met by VETlink software / patient flow management tools?
*	How has COVID era changed check in needs?
#### Why Interviews
Moderated remote semi-structured interviews allow us to follow the usersâ€™ attitudes and thinking throughout the interview, which is appropriate this early in the process. We can candidly learn about what is important about check-in/patient management to individual people and understand the complexity of challenges they face in this part of their responsibilities.
#### Recruiting
MSAs (3-5), Clerks (5-7), Nurses (3-5), Docs (3-5), Group Practice Managers (3-5), Kiosk Managers (3-5), Enrollment Managers (3), Lab Tech / Pharmacy Tech (3-5)

### Site Visits / Contextual Inquiry:
Understand the context of use, barriers, and behaviors, so that the new check-in process integrates into the workflow with minimal disruption.
#### Possible Research Questions
*	What are tools in use for checking patients in and managing workflow? How do staff interact with them? 
*	What are current barriers to checking patients in, managing patients through the clinical workflow? 
*	What are the constraints of the physical environment?
*	What are competing responsibilities of staff? 
*	What workarounds have people developed?
#### Why Site Visits
Site visits allow a broader scope of visibility through observation. Allowing insight into the people, places, and artifacts involved in the task of check-in and patient management. It also allows us to see how implementations have been adapted to particular physical environments.
#### Site Selection
At least 5 sites, representing at least 3 different regions, +/avg/- satisfaction ratings, at least 2 VAMCs and 2 CBOCs, 2 urban, 2 rural, kiosk usage (What other factors? Appt volume? Population served?)
