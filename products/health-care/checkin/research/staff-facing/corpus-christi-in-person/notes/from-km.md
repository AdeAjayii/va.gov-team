# Corpus Christi Research Trip 
Kristen McConnell’s Notes

## July 19

### Corpus Christi VA Clinic
5283 Old Brownsville Road

[Diagram of MSA area from notebook]

When you entered two security guards did a COVID screening. Immediately upon entering there is the check-in area and the only waiting room within the Outpatient clinic. There were 6 MSAs stationed within the waiting room. 3 oversaw check-in. 1 oversaw community care. 2 oversaw check-outs and scheduling next appointments, but they could also complete check-in. To the right when entering was a desk for one volunteer and the door to the VA police.

Observations:
- There were limited amounts of signage on the walls, so the check-in posters stuck out.
- A huge check-in poster blocked sight of the kiosk from the front door. The kiosk was behind the poster. 

#### MSA 1
- Has observed Veterans having problems texting/creating the text message. 
- Believes that the Annex’s (the second location visited today) physical layout causes a problem for check-ins. 
- VSE is not as user friendly as VetLink
  - Fields are greyed out 
  - Have to click on a special needs box to add a comment.
- Educating Veterans about check-in can take 2-5 minutes per Veteran
- Check-in NPS: 6/7
  - Reasons given for rating:
    - Needs simpler wording
    - Veterans can’t see on their phone. Too small of a screen.
    - Needs to be a 2-3 step process
      - It is too much to read.
- Pre-check-in NPS: 8/9
  - Reasons given for rating:
    - Needs to make the transition from pre-check-in to check-in better
    - However, likes the review of information before an appointment
- Reported hearing/seeing this scenario occur: The SMS URL link took too long to show up, so the Veteran though that they were checked in after texting “check in.”
- They don’t really look at the check-in statuses in VSE-GUI.
  - They don’t use VSE-CS, but they have a log-in.
- Canceled appointments
  - The VA cancels appointments if a provider is out sick or on vacation
  - Their supervisor has to let them know what to do (if appointments should be canceled or if they could be covered by someone else)
  - From the time that they know a provider is out on short notice to the time that the MSA is told to start canceling can be 1 - 2 hours. This is due to a plan needing to be made. 
  - If it is last minute, Veterans may already be in route, because of the rural population coming to this clinic.
  - If there is more notice, 
    - the MSA gets emailed a list of patients with the date or date range that need changed/canceled/rescheduled.
    - The MSA attempts to call the Veteran 2 times to notify them of the cancellation and reschedule. If the Veteran doesn’t pick up the phone or call back, then they send a letter.

#### MSA 2
- They aren’t always sure what each error means, so they have trouble assisting the Veterans sometimes.
  - They sited the no appointment error message as one that they find confusing, because they will look into the system and see an appointment, so they don’t know why the Veteran got the message.
    - After further probing, we realized that this occurs a lot for the CVT appointments.
- They said it seems like a lot of Veterans attempt PCI, but get messages to see someone.
- They do a lot of education with the Veteran.  
  - It can take 2- 5 minutes for each Veterans.
  - They have had to do the process for the Veteran.
  - This time on education and the amount of Veterans coming to the desk can make you get a line. If there is a line, then the MSA just doesn’t do PCI. They manually check everyone in, since it is faster.
- There are “a lot coming up [to the check-in desk] to check-in than before.”
- For the first couple of days, they had staff our front by the entrance.
- VSE-GUI Feedback
  - What you can change is good
    - Has to go to Vista to change:
      - Emergency Contact
      - Residential Address
  - VSE is similar to Vetlink, but VistA is old
  - What statuses do you utilize?
    - They look if the Veteran completed pre-check-in as a clue to know that the Veteran may use their phone for check-in.
    - Pre-check-in completed and check-in completed.
  - “It is good.”
  - Uses the colors in the calendar part of VSE-GUI to do verify check-in statuses.
- VSE-CS Feedback
  - Vaccine appts are walk-ins and providers can’t see it
  - All of the MSAs have log-ins to VSE-CS, but they don’t use it.
    - It mirrors VistA.
  - Due to problems with VSE-CS, the nurses come out to the waiting room and call everyone’s name who has an appointment, whether why display as checked in or not. They don’t a Veteran to be just sitting in the waiting room for a long time or be no show, because they aren’t checked in, but they think that they are.
- MSAs do sometimes message nursing on Teams. When problems occur with check-in then that equals problems with communication with nurses. Nursing may move onto the next patient.
- Veterans think that when they completed pre-check-n that they are checked in.
  - Some comes up to the desk to verify that they are indeed checked in.
- Pre-check-in NPS: 5/6
- Check-in NPS: 4
  - Reasons for check-in rating:
    - Doesn’t like it for our population (older/non-tech savvy) 
    - That is requires the use of a phone
- Beneficiary Travel
  - It can be completed after check-in is started.
  - This MSA does help Veterans submit a claim on the kiosk.
    - Most often Veterans are just insecure about filing that way and they help them through the process.
  - When you do have to refer a Veteran to the travel office?
    - They normally have the Veteran call, because the travel office is so far from Corpus Christi.
    - It is most often, because a Veteran hasn’t gotten paid for a claim that they submitted.
- Canceled appointments
  - Appointments aren’t often canceled by the VA. It happens when a provider is out sick or on vacation. 
  - Another reason can be if the Veteran hasn’t completed any labs within a long time. The provider will ask to cancel and reschedule for a later time after the labs are completed.
  - To notify the Veteran that an appointment was canceled, the MSA will call the Veteran 2 times. If they don’t answer then they will send a letter.

#### Veteran 1
- While talking to MSA 2, a Veteran came up to the window. They had utilized PCI, but received the insurance review message.

#### Veteran 2
- They came to the check-in desk and spoke with MSA 2. They had a text message that they had an appointment in the morning, but they didn’t. It was a cancelled appointment but the message was still sent out. 

#### Nursing
- We talked to 5 nurses and 1 nursing manager as a group
- Nursing manager - Things don’t show up in VSE-CS, so nurses have stopped using it.
- Nurse - yes, the list won’t show up. I go to home, then daily, then clinic, then get an error.
  - Clinic management have to reassign
  - Non scheduled, such as vaccines, homelessness, and walk-in appointments, don’t show up in the lists.
- They can’t tell if a patient is checked in or not.
  - This happens every day, multiple times a day.
- Nurses round now.They go out and call every Veterans to see if they are either whether they show up as checked in or not.
- Veteran check-ins aren’t showing up in VSE-CS.
- Nurses want to know what building the Veterans are at. Veterans go to the wrong location; it happens a few times a week at their location.
  - This was a problem that was occurring when VetLink was enabled, so it isn’t a new problem.
- They like the pre-visit summary, but not that they can’t access it until the day of.
  - They want to pull that information a week ahead of time.
  - They want to print out the pre-visit summary for pre-visit calls.
- Routing sheets and pre-visit summary
  - [Add image of the routing sheet]
  - Want the Vet’s last labs to be pulled into the pre-visit summary
  - They don’t see a lot of value in the Veteran reviewing their med list prior to an appointment; they are just going to ask them to review it again.
  - Would like Veterans to answer/review Clinical Reminders in a pre-visit experience
  - 4 nurses stated that they would like to see behavioral flags within VSE-CS. 
    - It will help them know if security needs to be with a Veteran before they see them (for example)
- They brought up that Veterans don’t understand clinic names. 
  - The nurse manager is trying to fix this for this location.
- They want VSE to show the last 4 of the Veterans
- They miss the auditory alert that was available in VetLink.
- VSE-CS isn’t showing where the Veterans checked into. They is a problem when they have multiple appointment.
  - The nurse went to get the patient, but they were at a different clinic.
  - Patients also don’t check-in twice for multiple appointments.
- They want the ability to add a note or comment about why the Veteran is there.
- They want to know when they “no show” a patient, where does that information go. They would like it to go to MSAs.
  - Nursing thinks that it would be great if the system would allow MSAs to do a “no show” note and send (maybe automatically) a letter.
- Nursing leadership and some nurses do rounds in the waiting room to see if Veterans are there, whether they are checked in or not.

#### MSA Supervisor
- It took 2 years for Veterans to trust the kiosk. Now they feel that VA gave something and took it away.
- The lobby is small, so line get long fast and easy. 
- Before they would have someone in the lobby showing Veterans how to check-in. This was an MSA.
- Veterans don’t want to use the QR code.
- Younger vets use PCI.
- Wants to be able to monitor is PCI is working or not.
  - Also would like to tracked, who checks in on what team and by what employee, so they could tell…
    - If one desk is busier compared to other desks
  - They have looked at Power BI dashboards in the past.
    - Everyone Is getting used to the new working and training part. They want to know how to pull it.
- Pain points: it is time consuming, the demographic review is a lot. This is the same problem as the kiosk. However, they way it is on the phone (to scroll) that makes it seem like more.
- If Veterans aren’t able to check-in, because they see an error, the system tells them to check-in with a clerk. Veterans think that they checked in, but they didn’t. Vets seeing an error, yet think that they are checked in.
- Improvement suggestions:
  - Make it easier for elderly to use it/catch onto it.
  - Education is needed
- Prior to COVID, they had volunteers to help check-in and now they only have a few volunteers. Volunteers find it harder to help on Vet’s personal phone compared to the kiosks. They have to get closer to help and some Veteran don’t like that now due to COVID.
  - The size of a phone matter.
- They are interested in replicating the volunteer position with an MSA.
  - Wants to have an extra MSA in the lobby to train and educate. 
    - However, lost 3 MSAs in the last month, so education/being able to train Veterans is hard.
- Interested in us talking to Veterans more.
- Researcher: want anything else in VSE-CS?
  - Not sure on that one.
- Researcher: what would help with adoption or buy-in?
  - Education
- PCI has affected staffing. MSAs are assigned to a desk for a week. It affects who they can assign where. Check-ins take longer now, because there are more people checking in with MSA now. 
- Researcher: how has pre-check-in been working?
  - They have only seen a few. They estimate around 10%.
  - It delays day of check-in, because it confuses the patient. Veterans don’t understand the difference between the two.
  - They have seen a flyer, but suggests that other promo materials might help.
  - They don’t like pre-check-in. The have only seen a few pre-check-in statuses.
  - Pre-check-in NPS: 5
- Cancelled appointments
  - Depends on if a provider calls in sick or a provider wants to switch from in-person to telemedicine. This can happen 10-15 times per day. They call the Veteran to make sure that switching from in-person to a telemedicine appointment is ok.
  - They try to notice Veterans 45 days in advance (for provider leave scenarios). However, they may have to cancel on the day of the appointment.
  - 10-15% of cancellations are within 30 days or a week.
  - They will call and try to reschedule 
    - They will send a letter if they can print and mail it in time for the Veteran to actually receive it.
  - They make 2 phone calls, leave voicemails, and send a letter.
  - Veterans have/will show up for cancelled appointments.
    - If they di arrive, the staff will see if they can fit them in. They can be triaged by a nurse, but some/most will have to be rescheduled.
    - Travel pay for cancelled appointments can be claimed for one way.
- Volunteers can help with check-in/pre-check-in, but it is up to them. It really depends upon if they understand it themselves or not.

- We completed these intercepts over a 2 hour time period. We weren't able to intercept everyone. We talked to the next Veteran walking through the door as soon as we finished speaking with a Veteran. Some Veterans entered while we were already talking to someone else.

### Annex
It is located in the building directly behind the Corpus Christi VA Clinic.

Immediately after walking through the door, you walk into the waiting room. The check-in desks are to the left. There are 5 check-in desks with 4 MSAs and 1 Health Benefits Administrator. This location houses the following specialities and organizations:
- Audiology
- Vocational Rehab
- Dietician
- Texas Veterans Commission (VSOs)
  - The MSAs have to message the VSOs over Teams if a Veterans has an appointment/wants to speak with the VSOs.
- Hud-vash (Homeless Veterans)
  - They don’t have appointments.

The kiosks are this location are currently used for:
- Health benefit advisor appointments
- Requests for medical records
- Travel pay
- To Change information 

#### Health Benefits Advisor
- Veterans use the kiosk and checking in for an appointment with them. When they call the Veteran up, they realize that the Veteran thought they were checking in for a medical appointment. As a result, they often have to complete check-in for the Veteran.

#### MSA 1
- They only have the overview of what specialities are available at this Annex location.

#### MSA 2
- Veteran get scared about going to va.gov to complete check-in (thoughts about logging in)
- They sometimes see that a Veteran started check-in, but did not complete it.
- However, they only really review the check-in status if part of their team asks for them to check on a Veteran
- At the Annex, this MSA assist Veterans checking in. They educate Veterans, but it is a smaller and slower location.
- Nurses at this location come out to the waiting room and call Veterans even if they don’t see them checked in.
- Has to sometimes help educate Veterans as they use the kiosk.
- Does a lot of education on PCI.
- Check-in NPS: 10
- Pre-check-in
  - Looks at the pre-check-in started status in VSE-GUI
  - Says that 50% do it and 50% don’t.
  - Some Veterans are upset on day of check-in, because they think that they did everything already
  - NPS: no opinion

#### Chief
**First Meeting**
- Feedback on reporting
  - Can only see one clinic at a time
  - Can’t see more than one clinic.
  - Is interested in viewing by division (so all of Corpus Christi or one entire facility in Corpus Christi)
- Corpus Christi outpatient had an ~50% VetLink usage rate
- The labs under their purview still allow VetLink kiosk check-ins.
  - They have scheduled appointments for all labs.
    - However, a “Scheduled” lab doesn’t have to occur at the exact time it is scheduled for. A Veteran can come anytime within 14 days after the order is placed.
    - For example, if the appointment was 2 days ago, then they will still check the Veteran in for their lab.
  - There are no MSAs supporting/stationed at the labs. There isn’t anyone there to schedule Veterans into the lab.
- VISN 17 has another year with the kiosks (through FY23). The contract could possibly go through FY24, since they are no longer nationally supported.
- To truly get rid of all of their kiosks, they would want PCI to handle:
  - Walk-in appointments
  - Release of information requests
  - Health benefit advisor appointments
  - Travel pay
- They also looked at a kiosk recently and it had a Whole Health option. Saw this at Harlingen. They weren’t sure what the exact workflow for this way. They will look into it more of us and share the informaiton.
- Does’t know the ins and outs of travel pay, but mentions that the current system prints out a paper copy of the claim at the travel office upon submission. It may be ok to send the claim directly into BTSSS. Recommends talking to travel clerks more. We reassured them that we are.

**Second Meeting**
- CSE-CS isn’t refreshing, so nursing doesn’t know when a Veteran arrived
- Problem is PCI going down and VSE-CS going down a few times
- They watched Veterans checking in
- The QR code isn’t returning an anything in Harlingen - service isn’t good with AT&T customers there.
  - Knows that they need to increase wifi in Harlingen
- Looking into other reports that VSE-CS isn’t being used a lot (not sure what location that is happening at).
- Have CPRS access to see the behavioral flag report. The new Power BI report is going VISN wide.
  - They will send the report to us.
- They are going to check on the whole health workflow that exists on the kiosks. They aren’t sure what it exactly does.
- 90% use VSE-CS, but it isn’t required.
  - VSE-GUI is used by MSAs.
- They want the ability to present weekly numbers on check-in.

#### Veterans
- We didn’t intercept any Veterans while at the Annex. There were only a few the entered the facility and we were actively talking to staff when they did.
- Did witness one Veteran come in to talk with a VSO. After the MSA messaged the VSO, they realized that the Veteran didn’t have a scheduled appointment

#### MSA 4
- Their overall assessment of how the new check-in process is going: “Not very well, a lot get messages to see the MSA.”
  - It “made [check-in] more work.”
  - Veterans “type in check-in and think that they are done” until they come up to complain that they haven’t been seen or to double check that they are checked in.
  - Believes older Veterans have a difficult time with it.
  - More people are coming to MSAs. It is more work. 
  - Why can’t they do updates on their phones? - referring to contact, emergency contact, and next of kin
  - This can cause lines of patients.
- In VSE-GUI…
  - They use the calendar view to review the check-in status colors. However, they only look when a member of their team asks or when they are actively checking someone in.
  - What status is the most useful?
    - Check-in completed is used to know.
    - They have used the future status as well to let Veterans know that their appointment is in the future.
- They get Teams messages from their team sometimes asking if someone really isn’t checked in. They look if that person is or not.
- The nurses are using VSE-CS, but they heard from an LPN that the check-in statuses don’t always update.
  - They have a log in to VSE-CS, but they don’t use it.
- Patients complain about the new system not working correctly or that they didn’t bring a phone to their appointment.
- A couple of times a day they are teaching a Veterans to use PCI.
  - If it is busy, then they just check the Veteran in.
  - If it is slow, then they will educate the Veteran on PCI.
- Estimates that 20% of Veterans attempt PCI and many are frustrated that the kiosk is going away.
- They never received an email about mobile check-in until a month later it was live.
- How many bi-lingual Veterans do you encounter?
  - There are probably a lot, but they only encounter a few that don’t speak English. A lot of times, it is the caregiver who speaks Spanish.
- If someone does speak Spanish, how does check-in go?
  - A Spanish-speaking MSA normally helps.
- What would you change?
  - Make is simpler. This new system is more steps.
  - Gives an example from their civilian provider: SMS link is sent to them and when clicked it does directly to the appointment information
- Saw Veterans use “I’m here” for check-in.
- Check-in NPS: 3/4
- Pre-check-in
  - Sees comments that Veterans don’t know what the difference is between pre-check-in and check-in.
  - Patients come up after pre-checkin and have to check-in.
  - NPS: ?
- Canceled appointments
  - Reasons VA cancels: Provider is on leave or out sick
  - For short notice situations
    - another provider may cover for the provider, then the MSAs call to make sure the Veteran wants to see the new provider.
    - Otherwise, the MSA makes a phone call and leave a message. They may call back again.
    - Sometimes the patient comes into the office and they find coverage for them
  - For more notice, they make 2 phone calls, then send a letter.
- Travel pay
  - It happens after check-in.
  - Some Veterans ask for paper copies
  - They tell the Veteran to call the travel office when they have issues with getting a payment, want to claim more than 30 days in the past, or more than same day appointment.
  - They would want eligibility checked in any system that is created. 


## July 20

### South Enterprize VA Clinic
205 South Enterprize Parkway

#### Administrative Officier and MSA Supervisor
- Older population who don't care for the system.
- The security guards at the entrance help educate Veterans about PCI.
  - They tried to train security how to use the QR code, so they could teach others.
- MSA Supervisor and leads were without training in the beginning. They made it mandatory to help Veterans learn the system for 1.5 weeks.
- Veterans seem to prefer text to QR code
- They have MSAs encourage usage of the system. If more people use PCI it will help the MSAs, because there will be less back-up.
- Some Vets go to the kiosk. Have travel on the kiosk confused them (maybe).
- Want signage about check-in in the parking lot.
- MSA have a difficult time using the system. There is frustration about the amount of interruptions they experience.
- Veterans have asked them "Why did you get rid of the kiosk?" They assumed it was due to COVID and HIPAA.
- MSA love VSE-GUI compared to VetLink. Using only one system is great.
- Providers don't use VSE-CS, since it was optional.
- Nursing does use VSE-CS to see that a patient has checked in.
- Their lab is talking abotu using PCI, because they have scheduled labs. 
- They have 3 check-in areas within at this location: right by the front door, telemental health and mental health.
- There is a Spanish speaking population that are patients at this location.
  - If they have problems checking in, they use the kiosk and check-in using their phone
- Pre-check-in
  - They have seen about 20% ust. it
  - There is confusion between check-in and pre-check-in. They think that they are checked in.
  - They recently added...MSA call Veterans if they are 5 minutes late and some say that they are already here.
- Travel pay
  - They can file right after checking in.
  - Paper submissions would increase if it goes away on the kiosk.
  - MSAs fill out travel paperwork a lot.
  - If they never filed a claim, then they fill out initial paperwork for the direct deposit and mail it.
  - For community care, tehy bring a paper in with them to file.
- Reporting
  - Usage
    - By age group - so they know who to help educate
    - % of pre-check-in users
    - They do look at Power BI dashboards
- Asked about advertising.
  - They haven't seen too much about this new check-in process.
  - Wondered about something to reach older generations.
 
#### MSA 1
- Was stationed at the general check-in desks by the front door.
- Mentioned that some Veterans want to have a town hall to discussion the new check-in process. They aren't happy about it. I wasn't sure if they planned to attend an existing meeting or if they wanted to schedule something separate.
  - Older Veterans don't want to have to use their phone and be required to learn new technology.
- They see a lot of error regarding insurance. A Veteran will use PCI and get a message that their insurance needs to be checked, but the MSA looks in ICB and they aren't lsited.
- The new process has resulted in them checking in more Veterans. They are more busy.
