# Research Goals

The Modernized Check-In Team is reimaging the experience between a Veteran scheduling a medical appointment and having their appointment. In particular, the Modernized Check-In Team has created the portion of the ecosystem that enables Veterans to utilize their smartphone to “check in” to their appointments through VA.gov, which lets the VA know the patient has arrived for their appointment.

Our goal for this research is to utilize our [baseline research plan for the St. Louis pilot](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/pilot-feedback/research-plan.md), and more recently, [Bay Pines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/bay-pines-in-person-uat/research-plan.md), to evaluate pre-check-in and check-in at additional VAMCs.

Utilization for check-in across all VISNs with check-in enabled during the week of June 20 - 24 was 1.2%. Within that week, Texas Valley Coastal Bend HCS (Harlingen, TX) VISN had a utilization of 11%, which far exceeded the average. Our goal is to uncover how Texas Valley Coastal Bend HCS has implemented and operationalized check-in in order to share those findings with product owners, trainers and other VISNs.  

In addition, the Modernized Check-In Team is building off of the [beneficiary travel research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/104) that is pointing to a potential solution that integrates travel reimbursement with check-in. 

Specifically, we’re looking to accomplish the following: 

- Evaluate the effectiveness of pre-check-in and check-in with MSAs
- Better understand the percentage of Spanish speakers and if nuances exist within that population about patient check-in  
- Identify strengths, pain points and opportunities for improvement within the check-in ecosystem 
- Understand how, if at all, MSAs are using VSE-CS
- Understand what staff roles are interested in PCI reports as well as what data they are interested in reviewing
- Gain insights on the process for staff needing to cancel appointments 
- Gain insights on understanding the optimal experience for incorporating travel reimbursement into the check-in experience for Veterans 
- Understand what information travel assistants use and how to review and approve reimbursement requests 

# Research Questions

- How do Veterans feel about pre-check-in and check-in?
- What's the percentage of Veterans that are bi-lingual and low English proficient Spanish speakers? 
- What are some of the potential nuances of check-in that might be challenging for Spanish speakers to understand?  
- What staff role are interested in PCI report?
- What data do staff members want to review within PCI reports?
- How frequently does staff need to cancel appointments? 
- What's the process when staff needs to cancel an appointment? 
- How do staff notify Veterans that their appointment was canceled?
- How many days out do appointments typically get cancelled? 
- When do Veterans expect to complete a travel reimbursement claim in relation to their appointment? 
- What information do travel asisstants use to review and approve reimbursement requests?
- How do travel assistants use that information to review and approve a request?  

# Methodology 

We visited the Corpus Christi locations within the VA Texas Valley Healthcare System to observe and conduct intercept interviews with Veterans when they arrived for medical appointments. We interacted with Veterans during the check-in process, documented how their experience went with PCI and asked follow-up questions to understand what went well and what didn’t go well. 

We also observed and interviewed a variety of VA staff who have a role in PCI – mostly MSAs and MSA leads, but also nurses and administrators. 

We were able to observe Veterans and staff at Corpus Christi VA Clinic, South Enterprize VA Clinic, and Old Brownsville VA Clinic.  

The research plan, conversation guide and session notes for our [Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/corpus-christi-in-person) and [staff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/corpus-christi-in-person) studies can be found in VA’s GitHub repository for additional information. 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

- The pre-check-in experience makes day-of check-in easier for staff since contact information, emergency contact information and next of kin information has been reviewed.
  - LIKELY TRUE: It's likely that the speed of check-ins with VSE are quicker when contact information, emergency contact information and next of kin information is verified with pre-check-in. However, we did not collect enough information to validate. We did find out that pre-check-in and day of check-in are oftern cnfused.
- MSAs will have limited interaction with Veterans during check-in since Veterans are able to check-in on their smartphone.
  - DEFINITELY FALSE: Even though there is a portion of Veterans who do not need MSAs assistance when using PCI. MSAs spend a lot of time troubleshooting PCI for Veterans.
- MSAs will check Veterans in with VSE that don’t have a smartphone or have difficulty using their smartphone.
  - DEFINITELY TRUE: No MSA forced Veterans to use mobile check-in.
- MSAs will have shorter lines of Veterans waiting to be checked in.
  - LIKELY FALSE: MSAs reported that more Veterans are checking in with them now compared to before PCI's launch. 
- The number of applications that MSAs use to manage the check-in process will be reduced and, therefore, workload will be decreased.
  - LIKELY TRUE: MSAs stated that they liked the shift to VSE-GUI, because it is similar to VetLink and they are utilizing fewer software systems.
- MSAs are comfortable with troubleshooting error messages with Veterans and know how to clear appropriate review flags in VSE.
  - LIKELY FALSE: While staff often help troubleshoot; they aren't always sure what each error means. For instance, MSAs noticed Veterans coming to them, because they need to review their insurance. However, ICB won't have them listed.
- MSAs will indicate that communication between MSAs and clinicians is frictionless due to the staff applications working as intended.
  - MAYBE TRUE: Most communication is frictionless between MSAs and clinicians (particuarly nursing) when VSE-CS is functioning. However, they have been much frustration from staff, because VSE-CS hasn't been functioning properly. Staff do not find VSE-CS reliable enough to effectively utilize due to lists not updating and missing accurate information.
- MSAs provide Spanish translation support in an ad-hoc fashion to Veterans/caregivers when needed.
  - MAYBE TRUE FOR A LIMITED POPULATION. Staff mentioned some interactions with bilingual Veterans and caregivers, but didn't note this affecting check-in in any way. However, more information should be gathered to validate.
- Staff will be able to enumerate which PCI data they want to review within reports.
  - DEFINITELY TRUE. The Chief, Administrative Office and MSA Supervisor are all interested in check-in reports. There are interested in reviewing data on if PCI is working, numbers by division, percentage of pre-check-in users, and more.
- MSAs will indicate that Veterans would prefer to file a travel reimbursement with their check-in versus a separate encounter.
  - LIKELY TRUE: Most MSAs commented that adding travel pay to check-in would be a good thing for Veterans.
- Travel clerks will indicate that the workflow in the travel reimbursement prototypes are optimal for Veterans and that no required steps are missing. 
  - UNKNOWN. We were not able to talk to travel clerks during this trip.

# Key Findings
## Insights into Usage Numbers
1. Education initiatives, poster placement, and facility appointment volume might be contributing factors as to why Corpus Christi (11%) has higher than average PCI usage numbers (1.2%).

## Check-in Findings
2. For those Veterans/caregivers who attempted PCI, 43.75% (7 out of 16) successfully completed PCI.
3. Staff gave day of check-in a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of -67, which is bad.
4. Many Veterans prefer checking in with MSAs and that is okay.
5. A portion of the staff believe staff and Veteran acceptance of PCI will just take time.
6. Negative first-time experiences greatly impact a Veteran’s desire to try PCI again.
7. Most of Veteran’s confusion occurred during the texting portion of the workflow.
8. Continued kiosk usage confuses Veterans. They aren’t sure when and why to utilize kiosks or not.
9. The number of  PCI scenarios that direct Veterans to “see staff” cause Veterans frustration. This also causes staff to spend a lot of time troubleshooting.
10. Veterans aren’t sure what appointment types can use PCI to check-in.
11. Sometimes Veterans aren’t sure if they are checked in or not when using PCI. Sometimes they end up being checked in and sometimes they aren’t.
12. Long load times are negatively impacting the PCI experience for a portion of Veterans.
13. MSA workloads have increased due to checking in more Veterans who don’t want to try PCI, educating Veterans about PCI, and troubleshooting PCI.
14. Staff have questions about the marketing efforts related to PCI.
15. Staff had many feature requests for PCI.

## Pre-check-in Findings
16. Many staff and Veterans are not aware of pre-check-in or confused about its difference compared to checking in on the day of an appointment.
17. Staff gave pre-check-in a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of -60, which is bad.

## VSE-GUI and VSE-CS Findings
18. MSAs who transitioned from VetLink to VSE-GUI generally approve of the shift.
19. Staff do not find VSE-CS reliable enough to effectively utilize due to lists not updating and missing accurate information, which is causing more work for nursing.
20. Veterans sometimes don’t check in for subsequent appointments in the day; as a result, nurses can’t tell if a Veteran is checked in or not due to their list permissions.
21. Nursing is overly notified about every Veteran status change in VSE-CS.
22. Nursing want to see certain behavioral flags within VSE-CS, because they affect how they prepare for an appointment and how they interact with a Veteran.
23. Nursing wants VSE-CS to change the customized list rules, display walk-in appointments, show last 4 of SSN, and improve notes.
24. Specialty (non-primary care) nurses only find the pre-visit summary helpful when it is received prior to their pre-appointment phone call to the Veteran.
25. Approximately half of the MSAs routinely use the pre-check-in complete, check-in started, and check-in complete statuses within VSE-GUI.
26. The training timeline and support on the first few days did not meet staff expectations.

## PCI Reporting Findings
27. The Chief, Administrative Officer, and MSA Supervisors are interested in check-in reports.

## Canceled Appointment Findings
28. VA cancels appointments due to providers calling out sick, scheduling vacation, or taking time off. Canceling on short notice occurs with some frequency.

## Travel Reimbursement Findings
29. MSAs often help Veterans complete travel reimbursement via the kiosk and paper form.

## Translation Findings
30. Staff mentioned some interactions with bilingual Veterans and caregivers, but didn’t note this affecting check-in in any way.

## Key Findings 

### Insights into Usage Numbers: Possible reasons why usage is higher at these facilities

#### 1. Education initiatives, poster placement, and facility appointment volume might be contributing factors as to why Corpus Christi (11%) has higher than average PCI usage numbers (1.2%).

- A third of the staff mentioned how much they focus on educating Veterans about this new process, which they believe is making a huge difference to Veteran adoption.
  - This education does come at a price. All MSAs cited an increase to their workflow.
    - See additional details within Key Finding #13.
- PCI posters weren’t competing with other signage on the walls and they were prominently placed on or near kiosk to drew Veterans’ attention.
- These facilities see a steady stream of Veterans checking in, but they aren’t overly busy compared to other locations. This might allow staff the time to focus on Veteran education.
- Posters were often overlooked in our past [St. Louis-Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/StLouis-pilot-feedback/research-findings.md), [Bay Pines-Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/bay-pines-in-person-uat/research-findings.md) and [Bay Pines-Staff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/bay-pines-in-person) studies. In those studies, Veterans went directly to the line to talk to the MSA. While some Veterans did immediately enter the MSA line at Corpus Christi, others immediately walked up to the poster.

- **RECOMMENDATION:**
  - Share this information with the training team, so they can pass it along to the field.

### Check-in Findings: Day of the appointment feedback

#### 2. For those Veterans/caregivers who attempted PCI, 43.75% (7 out of 16) successfully completed PCI.
- Success = Not having to talk to MSA to check-in.
  - We did not count the following scenarios as success completions due to Veteran frustration about having to talk to the MSA after attempting PCI, but they are part of how the system is designed:
    - 3 needed to review their insurance.
    - 3 were checking in for a clinic that wasn’t PCI enabled/received a “no appt” error.
    - 1 needed to update their next of kin.
  - The two other failures were caused by a time-out error and frustration scanning the QR code.
- 63% (26 out of 41) of Veterans who we intercepted were at the facility to check-in for an appointment.
  - 61.5% (16 out of 26) of Veterans checking in wanted to try PCI.
  - The non-PCI eligible task that the most Veterans were trying to complete was checking in for walk-in appointments (6 Veterans)
- Other tasks that Veterans we intercepted were trying to complete were:
  - scheduling an appt
  - double checking future appointments
  - updating their VHIC card
  - random questions for the MSA
- Two caregivers used PCI to check in a Veteran. Neither were successful, but this was not due to PCI.
  - One had QR code problems.
  - The other received a “no appt” error.

#### 3. Staff gave day of check-in a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of -67*, which is bad.
- 12 staff evaluated PCI via NPS:
  - Promoters: 8.33%
  - Neutrals/Passives: 16.67%
  - Detractors: 75% 
- Reasons staff gave for their ratings:
  - They don’t like PCI for older and non-tech savvy Veterans. 
  - They don’t like that it requires the user of a phone.
  - They believe that it needs to be simpler, such as a 2-3 steps process that has less information on a page.
    - It is difficult to review everything on such a small screen.

*\*Not statistically significant, but included anyway due to the overwhelming negative responses from the small sample that we were able to gather.*

**About NPS (information taken from [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/experience-management/customer/net-promoter-score/)):**
- NPS measures customer loyalty and satisfaction. It is evaluated by asking one question: On a scale from 1 to 10 (where 1 is very unlikely, and 10 is very likely), how likely are you to recommend mobile check-in to another clinic? Responses are broken into categories of Detractors (Score 0-6), Passives/Neutrals (Score 7-8), and Promoters (Score 9-10). Then, the Promoter percentage is subtracted by the Detractor percentage to get a final NPS number. Final NPS numbers can range from -100 to 100. Evaluating if the final score is good or bad really depends upon the industry as each has slightly different averages, but it is generally deemed to be a bad score if it is less than zero.
- Check-in will use this metric to evaluate the the product over time. It is never to be used by itself; it should accompany qualitative research.
- Check-in has only collected a small sample of NPS to date, so we aren’t ready to make comparisons over time. We also excluded the Veteran NPS scores that we were able to collect at Corpus Christi, because we were only able to collect 4.

#### 4. Many Veterans prefer checking in with MSAs and that is okay.
- 61.5% (16 out of 26) of Veterans checking in for an appointment wanted to try PCI.
  - Many Veterans just wanted to talk to the MSA.
  - Some immediately went over to the kiosk to attempt check-in.
- Numerous staff members have been receiving pushback from Veterans on trying PCI, because they: 
  - Don’t have a smartphone
  - Prefer a larger screen, similar to the kiosk
  - Worry about incurring charges on their phone.
- Anecdotally, staff believe older Veterans have more complaints about PCI and come to them with more questions.
  - They think younger Veterans more often utilize the system.
- This findings has existed within numerous check-in research studies, including [initial discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/remote-discovery/research-findings.md), [St. Louis-Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/StLouis-pilot-feedback/research-findings.md), [St. Louis-Staff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/pilot-feedback/research-findings.md), [Bay Pines-Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/bay-pines-in-person-uat/research-findings.md), and [Bay Pines-Staff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/bay-pines-in-person).
- **Recommendation**
  - Staff should continue to offer PCI as an option and educate Veterans, but not make PCI required.
  - Look into other workflows or products to expand the check-in ecosystem, such as digital check-in with a VA owned device (laptop or iPad).

#### 5.  A portion of the staff believe staff and Veteran acceptance of PCI will just take time.
- A small group (3) of staff cited their past experiences with the rollouts of the kiosk and telemedicine appointments as reasons why they believe acceptance of PCI will just take some time. They shared that kiosks and telemedicine appointments initially had some resistance, but were ultimately embraced.

#### 6. Negative first-time experiences greatly impact a Veterans desire to try PCI again.
- A few Veterans mentioned when researchers first intercepted them that they attempted PCI before and ran into difficulty. Therefore, they were hesitant to try again. 
  - Some of these Veterans changed their minds when researchers offered to provide support throughout the process.
- One third of staff members mentioned how important it was to help educate Veterans when they try PCI, in order to obtain a favorable outcome.
-**Recommendation**
  - Having helpers assist Veterans through the PCI experience, particularly their first time, is very important. Pass this information along to the training team, so they can share it with the field.

#### 7. Most of Veteran’s confusion occurred during the texting portion of the workflow.
- Veterans experienced problems understanding how to create a new text message to a new number; some only had experience replying to message threads already created.
- Others had difficulty understanding and scanning the QR code.
- One Veteran thought they were checked in immediately after texting “check in.”
- These confusion points were noted within both the staff research and from the Veteran observations.
- Observed QR code complications:
  - One Veteran had to update their QR code scanner, then deemed the process as too complicated.
  - Another had a QR code scanner that included a lot of advertisements and they clicked on an ad. 
  - Another didn’t know that they had to hit send on the SMS message after scanning the QR code. They just thought that they were done after they scanned the code.
- **Recommendation**
  - Reimagine the text portion of the workflow in one or more of the following ways:
    - Notify Veterans better that there are more steps.
    - Don’t make Veterans start the workflow by creating a text or scanning  the QR code. Instead, push a check-in notification to Veterans when they can check-in (30 minutes prior to their appt).
    - Spend more time educating Veterans about the process.

#### 8. Continued kiosk usage confuses Veterans. They aren’t sure when and why to utilize kiosks or not.
- Staff commented that they often have to direct Veterans away from utilizing the kiosk, since they can no longer check-in on them. 
  - During Veteran observations, many automatically walked over to the kiosk.
- Corpus Christi is still utilizing kiosks for travel pay, walk-in appointments, release of information requests, health benefit advisor appointments, and whole health.
- Having the check-in poster placed directly on the kiosk helped to eliminate some confusion.
- This same finding was part of the [Bay Pines-Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/bay-pines-in-person-uat/research-findings.md) and [Bay Pines-Staff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/bay-pines-in-person) study findings.
- **Recommendation**
- Get rid of the kiosks completely or create a new VA-owned device solution for check-in.
- Share with training the impacts of poster placement on kiosk usage. Possible create a sticker or something else to place on the kiosks stating that check-in isn’t available on them.

#### 9. The number of  PCI scenarios that direct Veterans to “see staff” cause Veterans frustration. This also causes staff to spend a lot of time troubleshooting.
- Staff report handling Veteran complaints when Veterans are directed to staff after attempting PCI.
  - **“[Check-in is] not going very well. A lot get messages to see the MSA.” - MSA**
  - **“It is a waste.” - MSA**
- Staff aren’t always sure what each error means.
  - MSAs have noticed Veterans coming to them, because they need to review their insurance. However, ICB won’t have them listed.
- We had a similar research question within our [Bay Pines-Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/bay-pines-in-person-uat/research-findings.md) and [Bay Pines-Staff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/bay-pines-in-person) studies to understand staff’s comfort with troubleshooting, but the results of those studies were inconclusive.
- **Recommendation**
  - Re-evaluate adding editing and reviewing insurance within the PCI experience, so Veterans aren’t redirected to check-in with a staff member as often.

#### 10. Veterans aren’t sure what appointment types can use PCI to check-in.
- 3 Veterans, who researchers intercepted, were checking in for a clinic that wasn’t PCI enabled/received a “no appt” error.
- Staff also report seeing Veterans trying to use PCI for vaccine appointments.
- **Recommendation**
  - Revisit adding or changing this information within marketing materials.
  - Pushing check-in links to Veterans 30 minutes prior to an appointment would make this a non-issue.

#### 11. Sometimes Veterans aren’t sure if they are checked in or not when using PCI. Sometimes they end up being checked in and sometimes they aren’t.
- Staff reported and researchers observed Veterans coming up to MSAs to double check that PCI did indeed check them into their appointment.
- Other times, Veterans don’t complete check-in and just sit in the waiting room. 
  - MSA noted that some Veterans come up to the desk after waiting for a long time to find out that they have already been “no showed.”
    - Some MSAs have been able to stop “no shows” from happening by reviewing the “Check-in started” status within VSE-GUI.
      - However, not all MSAs routinely check these statuses.
  - In order to avoid this problem, MSA and nursing staff have instituted rounding for all Veterans on the appointment list, whether they are checked in (using any method) or not.
    - This relates to Key Finding #19.
- **Recommendation**
  - Revisit check-in status content within the application.

#### 12. Long load times are negatively impacting the PCI experience for a portion of Veterans.
- Researchers observed long load times for a few Veterans. 
  - One Veteran experienced a time-out error, so they abandoned PCI and talked to an MSA instead.
  - The first VA.gov page took a long time to load for one Veteran and the header loaded first. The Veteran logged in to VA.gov thinking that was their next step.
- Staff report Veterans sometimes think that they are checked in, because of the delay in receiving a text with the next step.
- Staff say that sometimes scanning the QR code doesn’t return anything for Veterans to click on.
- Staff noted that service from certain phone carriers impacts the Veteran’s ability to complete PCI within certain facilities.
- Long load times were also noted with the [St. Louis Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/StLouis-pilot-feedback/research-findings.md) study.
- **Recommendation**
  - Continue looking into ways to improve load time.
  - Explore a further simplified header and footer to reduce Veterans leaving workflows like check-in.

#### 13. MSA workloads have increased due to checking in more Veterans who don’t want to try PCI, educating Veterans about PCI, and troubleshooting PCI.
- MSAs believe the increase is due to more Veterans coming to the desk to be checked in by the MSA as well as the need to educate Veterans about PCI.
  - Educating Veterans about the new check-in process is estimated by MSAs and volunteers to take 2-5 minutes.
    - Anecdotally, the MSAs feel most of their education efforts are spent with older Veterans.
- One MSA Supervisor shared that the extra work has made an impact on their staff decisions and where they place certain MSAs for the week.
- Increased MSA workloads were also noted within the [St. Louis-Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/StLouis-pilot-feedback/research-findings.md) findings.
- **Recommendation**
  - Encourage all staff (nurses, volunteers, MSAs, etc.) to collaboratively educate Veterans about check-in.

#### 14. Staff have questions about the marketing efforts related to PCI.
- They have concerns and questions about what marketing efforts have already occurred due to:
  - Veterans letting them know that emails were sent out a month after PCI started at their facilities.
  - Not seeing a lot of marketing materials that they can pass out to Veterans.
  - Handling a lot of Veteran questions.
- **Recommendation**
  - Revisit staff education about the available marketing materials.
  - Continue to iterate on the marketing strategy.

#### 15. Staff had many feature requests for PCI. Many staff asked if PCI could handle additional appointment types.
- Checking in for additional appointment types:
  - Scheduled labs
    - Scheduled lab appointments don’t have to occur at the exact time that they are scheduled for. A Veteran can come in anytime within 14 days of the order being placed.
      - No MSAs are currently supporting/stationed at the lab. These appointments are checked in via the kiosk.
  - Walk-ins
  - Health benefit advisor.
- Provide an alternative to submitting travel reimbursement claims on the kiosk.
- Handling release of information requests.
- Handle the whole health kiosk use case.
- Allowing Veterans to edit their pre-registration information.
  - The suggestion to edit pre-registration information was mentioned in numerous previous studies, including [St. Louis-Staff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/pilot-feedback/research-findings.md).
- Showing the address of the clinics, because many Veterans come to the wrong location.
  - Researchers observed more than one Veteran coming to the wrong locations during our trip. Staff also highlighted that this occurs.
    - This may be due to the location within Corpus Christi being only 5 minutes apart.
- Explore a different starting point for PCI.
  - Some staff put “VA Check-in” as a contact within Veterans’ phones, so it would be easier for them in the future. They mentioned that it would enable Veterans to check-in from the parking lot.
- Improve clinic names, because they aren’t easy to understand.
