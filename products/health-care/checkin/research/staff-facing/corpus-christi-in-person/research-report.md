# Research Goals

The Modernized Check-In Team is reimaging the experience between a Veteran scheduling a medical appointment and having their appointment. In particular, the Modernized Check-In Team has created the portion of the ecosystem that enables Veterans to utilize their smartphone to “check in” to their appointments through VA.gov, which lets the VA know the patient has arrived for their appointment.

Our goal for this research is to utilize our [baseline research plan for the St. Louis pilot](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/pilot-feedback/research-plan.md), and more recently, [Bay Pines](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/bay-pines-in-person-uat/research-plan.md), to evaluate pre-check-in and check-in at additional VAMCs.

Utilization for check-in across all VISNs with check-in enabled during the week of June 20 - 24 was 1.2%. Within that week, Texas Valley Coastal Bend HCS (Harlingen, TX) VISN had a utilization of 11%, which far exceeded the average. Our goal is to uncover how Texas Valley Coastal Bend HCS has implemented and operationalized check-in in order to share those findings with product owners, trainers and other VISNs.  

In addition, the Modernized Check-In Team is building off of the [beneficiary travel research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/104) that is pointing to a potential solution that integrates travel reimbursement with check-in. 

Specifically, we’re looking to accomplish the following: 

- Evaluate the effectiveness of pre-check-in and check-in with MSAs
- Better understand the percentage of Spanish speakers and if nuances exist within that population about patient check-in  
- Identify strengths, pain points and opportunities for improvement within the check-in ecosystem 
- Understand how, if at all, MSAs are using VSE-CS
- Understand what staff roles are interested in PCI reports as well as what data they are interested in reviewing
- Gain insights on the process for staff needing to cancel appointments 
- Gain insights on understanding the optimal experience for incorporating travel reimbursement into the check-in experience for Veterans 
- Understand what information travel assistants use and how to review and approve reimbursement requests

- How do Veterans feel about pre-check-in and check-in?
- What's the percentage of Veterans that are bi-lingual and low English proficient Spanish speakers? 
- What are some of the potential nuances of check-in that might be challenging for Spanish speakers to understand?  
- What staff role are interested in PCI report?
- What data do staff members want to review within PCI reports?
- How frequently does staff need to cancel appointments? 
- What's the process when staff needs to cancel an appointment?

- When do Veterans expect to complete a travel reimbursement claim in relation to their appointment? 
- What information do travel asisstants use to review and approve reimbursement requests?
- How do travel assistants use that information to review and approve a request?  

# Methodology 

We visited the Corpus Christi locations within the VA Texas Valley Healthcare System to observe and conduct intercept interviews with Veterans when they arrived for medical appointments. We interacted with Veterans during the check-in process, documented how their experience went with PCI and asked follow-up questions to understand what went well and what didn’t go well. 

We also observed and interviewed a variety of VA staff who have a role in PCI – mostly MSAs and MSA leads, but also nurses and administrators. 

We were able to observe Veterans and staff at Corpus Christi VA Clinic, South Enterprize VA Clinic, and Old Brownsville VA Clinic.  

The research plan, conversation guide and session notes for our [Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/corpus-christi-in-person) and [staff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/corpus-christi-in-person) studies can be found in VA’s GitHub repository for additional information. 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

- The pre-check-in experience makes day-of check-in easier for staff since contact information, emergency contact information and next of kin information has been reviewed.
  - LIKELY TRUE: It's likely that the speed of check-ins with VSE are quicker when contact information, emergency contact information and next of kin information is verified with pre-check-in. However, we did not collect enough information to validate. We did find out that pre-check-in and day of check-in are oftern cnfused.
- MSAs will have limited interaction with Veterans during check-in since Veterans are able to check-in on their smartphone.
  - DEFINITELY FALSE: Even though there is a portion of Veterans who do not need MSAs assistance when using PCI. MSAs spend a lot of time troubleshooting PCI for Veterans.
- MSAs will check Veterans in with VSE that don’t have a smartphone or have difficulty using their smartphone.
  - DEFINITELY TRUE: No MSA forced Veterans to use mobile check-in.
- MSAs will have shorter lines of Veterans waiting to be checked in.
  - LIKELY FALSE: MSAs reported that more Veterans are checking in with them now compared to before PCI's launch. 
- The number of applications that MSAs use to manage the check-in process will be reduced and, therefore, workload will be decreased.
  - LIKELY TRUE: MSAs stated that they liked the shift to VSE-GUI, because it is similar to VetLink and they are utilizing fewer software systems.
- MSAs are comfortable with troubleshooting error messages with Veterans and know how to clear appropriate review flags in VSE.
  - LIKELY FALSE: While staff often help troubleshoot; they aren't always sure what each error means. For instance, MSAs noticed Veterans coming to them, because they need to review their insurance. However, ICB won't have them listed.
- MSAs will indicate that communication between MSAs and clinicians is frictionless due to the staff applications working as intended.
  - MAYBE TRUE: Most communication is frictionless between MSAs and clinicians (particuarly nursing) when VSE-CS is functioning. However, they have been much frustration from staff, because VSE-CS hasn't been functioning properly. Staff do not find VSE-CS reliable enough to effectively utilize due to lists not updating and missing accurate information.
- MSAs provide Spanish translation support in an ad-hoc fashion to Veterans/caregivers when needed.
  - MAYBE TRUE FOR A LIMITED POPULATION. Staff mentioned some interactions with bilingual Veterans and caregivers, but didn't note this affecting check-in in any way. However, more information should be gathered to validate.
- Staff will be able to enumerate which PCI data they want to review within reports.
  - DEFINITELY TRUE. The Chief, Administrative Office and MSA Supervisor are all interested in check-in reports. There are interested in reviewing data on if PCI is working, numbers by division, percentage of pre-check-in users, and more.
- MSAs will indicate that Veterans would prefer to file a travel reimbursement with their check-in versus a separate encounter.
  - LIKELY TRUE: Most MSAs commented that adding travel pay to check-in would be a good thing for Veterans.
- Travel clerks will indicate that the workflow in the travel reimbursement prototypes are optimal for Veterans and that no required steps are missing. 
  - UNKNOWN. We were not able to talk to travel clerks during this trip.

# Key Findings
**Insights into Usage Numbers**
1. Education initiatives, poster placement, and facility appointment volume might be contributing factors as to why Corpus Christi (11%) has higher than average PCI usage numbers (1.2%).

**Check-in Findings**
2. For those Veterans/caregivers who attempted PCI, 43.75% (7 out of 16) successfully completed PCI.
3. Staff gave day of check-in a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of -67, which is bad.
4. Many Veterans prefer checking in with MSAs and that is okay.
5. A portion of the staff believe staff and Veteran acceptance of PCI will just take time.
6. Negative first-time experiences greatly impact a Veteran’s desire to try PCI again.
7. Most of Veteran’s confusion occurred during the texting portion of the workflow.
8. Continued kiosk usage confuses Veterans. They aren’t sure when and why to utilize kiosks or not.
9. The number of  PCI scenarios that direct Veterans to “see staff” cause Veterans frustration. This also causes staff to spend a lot of time troubleshooting.
10. Veterans aren’t sure what appointment types can use PCI to check-in.
11. Sometimes Veterans aren’t sure if they are checked in or not when using PCI. Sometimes they end up being checked in and sometimes they aren’t.
12. Long load times are negatively impacting the PCI experience for a portion of Veterans.
13. MSA workloads have increased due to checking in more Veterans who don’t want to try PCI, educating Veterans about PCI, and troubleshooting PCI.
14. Staff have questions about the marketing efforts related to PCI.
15. Staff had many feature requests for PCI.

**Pre-check-in Findings**
16. Many staff and Veterans are not aware of pre-check-in or confused about its difference compared to checking in on the day of an appointment.
17. Staff gave pre-check-in a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of -60, which is bad.

**VSE-GUI and VSE-CS Findings**
18. MSAs who transitioned from VetLink to VSE-GUI generally approve of the shift.
19. Staff do not find VSE-CS reliable enough to effectively utilize due to lists not updating and missing accurate information, which is causing more work for nursing.
20. Veterans sometimes don’t check in for subsequent appointments in the day; as a result, nurses can’t tell if a Veteran is checked in or not due to their list permissions.
21. Nursing is overly notified about every Veteran status change in VSE-CS.
22. Nursing want to see certain behavioral flags within VSE-CS, because they affect how they prepare for an appointment and how they interact with a Veteran.
23. Nursing wants VSE-CS to change the customized list rules, display walk-in appointments, show last 4 of SSN, and improve notes.
24. Specialty (non-primary care) nurses only find the pre-visit summary helpful when it is received prior to their pre-appointment phone call to the Veteran.
25. Approximately half of the MSAs routinely use the pre-check-in complete, check-in started, and check-in complete statuses within VSE-GUI.
26. The training timeline and support on the first few days did not meet staff expectations.

**PCI Reporting Findings**
27. The Chief, Administrative Officer, and MSA Supervisors are interested in check-in reports.

**Canceled Appointment Findings**
28. VA cancels appointments due to providers calling out sick, scheduling vacation, or taking time off. Canceling on short notice occurs with some frequency.

**Travel Reimbursement Findings**
29. MSAs often help Veterans complete travel reimbursement via the kiosk and paper form.

**Translation Findings**
30. Staff mentioned some interactions with bilingual Veterans and caregivers, but didn’t note this affecting check-in in any way.

## Key Findings 

### Insights into Usage Numbers: Possible reasons why usage is higher at these facilities

#### Education initiatives, poster placement, and facility appointment volume might be contributing factors as to why Corpus Christi (11%) has higher than average PCI usage numbers (1.2%).

- A third of the staff mentioned how much they focus on educating Veterans about this new process, which they believe is making a huge difference to Veteran adoption.
  - This education does come at a price. All MSAs cited an increase to their workflow.
    - See additional details within Key Finding #13.
- PCI posters weren’t competing with other signage on the walls and they were prominently placed on or near kiosk to drew Veterans’ attention.
- These facilities see a steady stream of Veterans checking in, but they aren’t overly busy compared to other locations. This might allow staff the time to focus on Veteran education.
- Posters were often overlooked in our past [St. Louis-Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/StLouis-pilot-feedback/research-findings.md), [Bay Pines-Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/bay-pines-in-person-uat/research-findings.md) and [Bay Pines-Staff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/bay-pines-in-person) studies. In those studies, Veterans went directly to the line to talk to the MSA. While some Veterans did immediately enter the MSA line at Corpus Christi, others immediately walked up to the poster.
