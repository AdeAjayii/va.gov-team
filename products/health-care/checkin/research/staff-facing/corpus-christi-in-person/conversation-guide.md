## Intro - 1 minute 

Hello. My name is [Kristen or Nira] and I’m a researcher on the patient check-in team. We are interested in learning about how the new pre-check-in and check-in process has been working and impacting your job. Our goal is to listen and use your feedback to continue to improve the check-in process for Veterans and staff like yourself. 

Do you mind if I observe you interacting with Veterans and ask you a few questions? This is completely voluntary. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention: 

- We want to hear your honest opinions. We will not be offended by any opinions you express. We welcome your feedback. 
- If for any reason, and at any time, you want to stop this session, just let me know.

## Section 4: Beneficiary Travel with MSAs

## Section 5: Beneficiary Travel with Travel Clerks 

### Introduction 

We are conducting research on behalf of OCTO to help evaluate BTSSS and the beneficiary travel reimbursement process to improve both the Veteran and staff experience. We would like to better understand your process for reviewing claims and what information you require to complete a review. We will be reviewing a map of the end-to-end process as we currently understand it. We are hoping you would help us continue to build out the map, correct any inaccuracies, and provide general feedback.

If we have time, we will also be reviewing a prototype of a possible Veteran experience.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention: 

- We want to hear your honest opinions. We will not be offended by any opinions you express. We welcome your feedback. 
- Are you comfortable if we record this session? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis. No comments are attributed to individuals. 
- Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. 

*Start recording.*

I have started recording.

### Process Map
Share the process map (link TBD).

This map is made of several layers. Let's review each. [Go through layer types.]

We'll go from left to right and dig through each step, using the layers as a checklist to add, change, or remove items.

Any questions?

[Begin reviewing the map in detail.]

#### General Questions (ask during the map exercise)

- Is there a scenario where the driving routes are challenged? Why? If so, is this still needed? And, what is this process like? 
- How often do manual reviews occur? Why? If so, are these still needed? And, what is this process like?  
- When is a Veteran able to start the claim process? E.g., once the appointment is scheduled, once the Veteran checks in, once the appointment is marked complete in VistA, etc. 
- Did the kiosks have a different starting point? If so, what were the reasons this changed with BTSSS? 
- In the future, is there a reason that the claim process couldn’t begin during check-in? Why or why not? 
- Who would be responsible for deciding?
