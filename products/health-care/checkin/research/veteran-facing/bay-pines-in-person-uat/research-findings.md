# Research Goals

The patient check-in (PCI) product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The Modernized Check-In Experience Team created the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to “check-in” through VA.gov. I.e., letting clinic staff know that the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Our goal for this research is to utilize our [baseline research plan for the St. Louis pilot](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/pilot-feedback/research-plan.md) to evaluate pre-check-in and check-in at additional VAMCs. In addition, the Modernized Check-In Team is building off of the [beneficiary travel research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/104) that is pointing to a potential solution that integrates travel reimbursement with check-in. Specifically, we’re looking to accomplish the following:

- Evaluate effectiveness of check-in and pre-check-in experiences with Veterans and staff. 
- Identify strengths, pain points and opportunities for improvements within the PCI ecosystem. 
- Understand how, if at all, MSAs are using VSE CS. 
- Gain insights into understanding the optimal experience for incorporating travel reimbursement into PCI for Veterans.* 

'* The Beneficiary Travel Reimbursement Path Analysis Team identified the check-in product as a recommended access point for Veterans to file for travel reimbursement, among other recommendations.

# Research Questions

- How often are Veterans using pre-check-in?
- Do Veterans assume they still have to do day-of check-in when pre-check-in is complete?
- What’s working and not working with pre-check-in and check-in?
- What changes could help improve the check-in process?
- How often are MSAs interacting with Veterans during the check-in process?
- Are MSAs checking in Veterans with VSE that need help versus requiring them to use mobile check in?
- How often are MSAs troubleshooting errors or clearing review flags?
- What are the issues that MSAs are helping Veterans troubleshoot?
- How do Veterans feel about pre-check-in and check-in?
- Are Veterans able to use the check-in poster?
- What would Veterans call this process?
- When do Veterans expect to complete a travel reimbursement claim in relation to their appointment?
- What steps should a Veteran have to complete for filing a travel reimbursement claim?
- What steps could be removed from the existing BTSSS process to make it easier for Veterans to file a claim?

# Methodology 

We visited Bay Pines Healthcare System (Bay Pines) to observe and conduct intercept interviews with Veterans when they arrived for medical appointments. We interacted with Veterans during the check-in process, documented how their experience went with PCI and asked follow-up questions to understand what went well and what didn’t go well. 

We were able to observe Veterans in multiple clinics at Bay Pines VAMC Building 100, Lakeside Building, Lee County VA Clinic, St. Petersburg VA Clinic and North Pinellas VA Clinic.  

We also observed and interviewed a variety of VA staff at those clinics who have a role in PCI – mostly MSAs and MSA leads, but also one clinician and a couple clinic managers. 

And, finally, we conducted a remote interview with three reimbursement travel assistants and supervisors where we collected feedback on a [travel reimbursement prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/f055a969-7909-4a63-9bb8-1dcbed216a42/a/l12VPzo/play) and asked follow-up questions. 

The research plan, conversation guide and session notes for our [Veteran](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/bay-pines-in-person-uat) and [staff](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/bay-pines-in-person) studies can be found in VA’s GitHub repository for additional information. 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans who use pre-check-in are able to complete the required steps.
     1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: Not enough information captured.  
1. Veterans who complete pre-check-in realize that they’re still required to use check-in on the day of their appointment.
     1. LIKELY FALSE: Some Veterans conflate pre-check-in and check-in. E.g., Veterans that complete pre-check-in think they've completed check-in, which results in staff not being aware the Veteran has arrived for their appointment.  
1. Completing the pre-check-in experience makes day-of check-in easier for Veterans since contact information, emergency contact information and next of kin information has been reviewed. 
     1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: Not enough information captured.  
1. MSAs will have limited interaction with Veterans during check-in since Veterans are able to check-in on their smartphone.
     1. DEFINITELY FALSE: Most Veterans do not see the check-in poster in the clinics. Therefore, they're waiting in line to speak with the MSA, often with their VA ID in hand. 
1. MSAs will check Veterans in with VSE that don’t have a smartphone or have difficulty using their smartphone.
     1. DEFINITELY TRUE: No MSA forced Veterans to use mobile check-in. 
1. MSAs will have shorter lines of Veterans waiting to be checked in.
     1. LIKELY FALSE: PCI utilization was very low in the clinics. Therefore, the line to get checked in with an MSA was not affected. However, when a line is present, a few Veterans would see the check-in poster and begin mobile check-in. 
1. MSAs are comfortable with troubleshooting error messages with Veterans and know how to clear appropriate review flags in VSE.
     1. MAYBE TRUE: We did not observe any MSAs troubleshooting error messages within the Veteran check-in experience. Instead, MSAs would start the manual check-in process in VSE, which helped skip potential friction with troubleshooting error messages.  
1. Veterans will indicate that check-in does not affect their care experience.
     1. MAYBE TRUE: We did not encouter any Veterans who had a negative experience with PCI. However, some Veterans prefer the VA-owned kiosks because the screen is larger and easier to see.  
1. Veterans are able to use the check-in poster without friction.
     1. DEFINITELY TRUE: 16/17 participants were able to use the check-in poster. One participant ran into an issue with the QR code not working as intended. 
1. Veterans refer to the process as “check in” or “mobile check in.”
     1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: Not enough information captured. However, some Veterans did describe it as "check-in."   
1. Veterans are called for their appointment once check-in is complete.
     1. LIKELY TRUE: Veterans who we observed using mobile check-in were updated in VSE. However, we did hear from MSAs that some issues exist with manually creating walk-in appointments. 
1. Veterans will indicate that the workflow in the travel reimbursement prototypes are optimal and that no required steps are missing. 
     1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: One Veteran explained how difficult it is to file a claim with Beneficiary Travel Self-service System (BTSSS) and get it approved. He said that he was close to giving up on filing claims since none of his claims get approved or reviewed very quickly. He thought that adding travel reimbursement during check-in would be ideal compared to the existing process with BTSSS. 

# Key Findings

1. A few clinics were not fully ready to use PCI due to conflicting communication or unresolved clinic-specific needs, e.g., routing slips. 
1. The kiosks were affecting the check-in experience for Veterans, e.g., using them, ignoring the check-in poster and thinking they’re checked in. Additionally, too many choices at the point of check-in (e.g., posters, brochures, VA-owned devices) may ultimately create confusion, leading Veterans to not use any mobile solution or VA-owned devices.
1. Confusion exists, for various reasons, among Veterans and MSAs on the difference between pre-check-in and check-in. 
1. MSAs from a few clinics and one Veteran thought that adding travel reimbursement to check-in would be valuable. 
1. The current travel reimbursement process for Veterans is complex due to nuances in how BTSSS works, eligibility criteria (e.g., community care vs. VA clinic appointments), claim review process, etc.   
1. Travel assistants recommend avoiding the inclusion of options in the travel reimbursement experience for Veterans that likely lead to a denial of reimbursement, such as “Other” fields, VTS and carpool. 
1. Many Veterans prefer checking in with MSAs, and that’s okay, while others preferred the kiosks because they’re a larger screen and easier to see. 
1. MSAs and one clinician confirmed feedback we’ve previously heard about the staff-facing applications; many of which are being addressed. E.g., adding last four, too much of a delay, etc. 
1. MSAs pointed out new feedback about the staff-facing applications. E.g., no shows not working, walk-ins not working, sort within each clinic/group, etc. 

Companion study research findings with staff

# Details of Findings 

Labels: AUD: Veterans, HDW: Smartphone, PRDT: health-care-check-in, RESRCH: User Acceptance Testing, RESRCH: Interviews, VETSJNY: Taking care of themselves

**There's a large cohort of Veterans that feel they shouldn't have to use their phone to check in at the VA. However, younger Veterans and returning patients have adopted the changes in a more streamlined manner.**

Of the 59 Veterans we spoke with, 17 (or 29%) either did not have a mobile device with a data plan or were unable or willing to use the mobile check-in process. 

And, of the 42 (or 71%) that did use the check-in process, a mixed sentiment was returned for the overall perception of check-in. Returning patients were the most confident using check-in. For example, Veterans returning for a routine visit to their primary care physician. And based on our observations, younger Veterans tended to have an easier time adjusting to the new process. 

*Positive*

> _It [mobile check in] was better than the kiosk._

> _It was super easy to get checked in._ 

> _Love how it works. It works really well._

> _I like not having to wait in a long line._

> _It was hard at first, but it’s been good now._

# Recommendations

**Reducing the number of Veterans thinking they’re checked in when they’re not**

1. Add a "check in now" message from VeText/CHIP delivered 30 minutes before the appointment. 
2. Test a stepped form design for check-in with Veterans as a way to better communicate the remaining steps.

**Better distinguish pre-check-in from check-in**

3. Add a link on the pre-check-in confirmation page for Veterans to [learn about how to check in on the day of their appointment](https://www.va.gov/resources/how-to-check-in-with-your-smartphone-for-some-va-appointments/). 
4. Explore new naming convention for “pre-check-in” that doesn’t include “check-in.” Specifically, draft new ideas and document usage across Veteran and staff-facing applications. Consider how pre-check-in may be perceived by Veterans once new functionality is introduced and considered more valuable compared to current state. E.g., health questionnaires, editing information and medication review.
5. Explore creating a test to send a pre-check-in reminder text (via VeText/CHIP), if not completed. 
6. As kiosks are removed, migrate remaining functionality into PCI, to the extent possible, especially as a way to improve the value of pre-check-in for Veterans, which will also help distinguish it from check-in. E.g., edit information, view future appointments and beneficiary travel reimbursement.

**Travel reimbursement**

7. Introduce travel reimbursement into PCI for Veterans to quickly file a claim during check-in. 
8. Talk to more travel assistants at Bay Pines and Corpus Christi to better understand what information in claims they’re reviewing, why it’s important and how they’re making decisions as a means to streamline the reimbursement process for Veterans. 

**Addressing Veterans that prefer the kiosks**

9. Explore reintroducing a VA-owned check-in device in clinics – once kiosks are removed and remaining functionality has been migrated into PCI or elsewhere – to better serve the needs of Veterans that aren't interested in a mobile check-in solution. And, as more functionality becomes available in both a VA-owned check-in device and a mobile solution, remove superfluous posters and brochures from clinics to streamline the check-in experience for Veterans. 

**Bug fixes**

10. Research if there’s any known QR code bugs associated with text messages not populating. 
11. Research how a Veteran may have received both a system not operational message from CHIP and a second message with a link to start their check-in.

**Staff-facing applications**

12. Revisit adding the ability to print routing slips, which is [something we’ve heard from clinics in previous discovery sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/site-visits/visit-notes/Pittsburgh-KM.md). 
13. Evaluate and prioritize all feedback mentioned by MSAs and one clinician about staff-facing applications that has been previously reported. E.g., adding last four, too much of a delay, update Veteran information in VSE or VSE CS, memo field, reason for visit for walk-ins in VSE, better notifications in VSE CS and last four. 
14. Evaluate and prioritize all new feedback mentioned by MSAs about staff-facing applications. E.g., no shows not working, multiple windows in VSE, walk-ins not working and sort within each clinic/group.

**Providing more information to Veterans in CHIP/VeText responses**

15. Explore adding appointment time to CHIP response when Veteran is too early for check-in. 
16. Explore adding information related to being too late for check-in to CHIP response when Veteran is too late for check-in.
17. Explore removing, "We're sorry," from CHIP response when a Veteran needs their health insurance reviewed to avoid possible Veteran concern or frustration.
