# Research Plan for Pre-check-in Discovery
August 2021

## Goals
### What product & team are you doing this research for?
VSA Healthcare Experience: Check-in

### Background
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. To help streamline the day of check-in experience, the healthcare experience team is exploring the concept of pre-check-in, which would allow Veterans to complete a series of tasks prior to their appointment from the comfort of their homes. These tasks could include:
- reviewing contact information
- reviewing insurance
- answering questionnaires

### Research questions:
- Do Veterans find value in being able to complete these tasks a few days prior to their appointment?
- What tasks do Veterans find value in?
- How do Veterans want to be notified that they have these tasks to complete?
- Are Veterans able to complete all of the pre-check-in tasks?

### Hypotheses:
- Veterans will verbalize how completing these tasks before an appointment is helpful to them, such as it will shortened their day of check-in experience or allow them to review the information on their own time and not rush.
- Veterans will have clear opinions on what tasks bring value to the pre-check-in experience.
- Based upon findings from previous research, Veterans will want to be notified via text or email.
- Veterans will be able to successfully review and updated all of the pre-check-in tasks. 

## Method
Remote, moderated sessions with interview questions, an Optimal Sort card sort, and review of a UXPin prototype conducted on Zoom.

## Participants and Recruitment
### Primary criteria / Must have:
- 15 participants (for a minimum of 8 completed sessions)
- Participants must use VA health care AND had an in-person medical appointment at a VA facility within the last two years (disqualify those that don't)

- Please screen participants based on these questions:
  - Does the following statement describe you? I currently use VA health care AND had an in-person medical appointment at a VA facility within the last two years.
    - Yes (Qualify)
    - No (Disqualify)

Please confirm participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screen share.
Note:
- For this session, we are unable to include those who use assistive technology, such as screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and ChromeVox).
- For this session, we are unable to include people with significant vision loss.
- For this session, we are unable to include people who use magnification tools.

### Secondary criteria / Would like to have
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 person of color
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person that has no college experience
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least one participant that has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities.
  - Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.
- At least one non-native English speaker
