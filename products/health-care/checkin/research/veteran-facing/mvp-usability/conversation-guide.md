# Conversation guide for Healthcare Experience Team, Check-in MVP Usability

## Moderator logistics

Use [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.

Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).

In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute

In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked

Check your \[screensharing setup\]

When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME\] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about checking in for medical appointment at the VA.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* This entire session should take no longer than 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We want to hear your thoughts on a possible new way to check-in. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* During this session, we'll be doing two things:
  * First, I'll start by asking you a few questions about your past experience check-in for VA medical appointments.
  * For the second half of the session, I'll send you a link to a prototype that one of our teams created to explain a new way to check-in. 
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Now, Iâ€™m going to ask you to think about your very last medical appointment that you actually went to the VA facility for.

* Can you describe checking in for that medical appointment?
  * Overall, how would you describe that check-in experience? Was it a good or bad experience? Easy or hard?
    * What did you like about it?
    * What did you not like about it?
* You checked in via [the method they mentioned in the previous question], but is that the method that you use most often?
  * _Clarify options available only if necessary._ This could be using the kiosk, talking directly with VA staff, using text messaging , or how your access virtual appointments.
* Have you ever had a check-in experience go wrong at the VA?
  * If so, can you share what happened?

## Usability

Alright, I want you to pretend that you have a VA medical appointment today. You have just arrived at the location of your appointment and you see the following sign hanging on the wall. 

* I'm going to send you a link in Zoom's chat feature, so you'll be able to see the poster. Go ahead and click that link when you're ready.

[Send link in chat: TBD] 

* Can you explain to me what we're looking at here?
  * What are your thoughts about what the poster is asking you to do?
  * 

* Since it's a prototype, it may not always work like the real VA.gov does, so if there's anything you want to know more about or unsure about, let me know.


Things to watch for:

* ????

## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes

* 
* Do you have any other thoughts on what we talked about today?
* Any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans, so thank you for your time.

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
