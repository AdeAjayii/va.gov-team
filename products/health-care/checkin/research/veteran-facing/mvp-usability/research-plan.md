# Research Plan for Check-in MVP Usability

## Goals

### What product & team are you doing this research for?

VSA Healthcare Experience: Check-in

### Background: 

This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. The healthcare experience team in particular will be creating the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via va.gov.

With this round of research, we are looking to test the usability and design of the proposed MVP.

### Research questions: 

What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

* Do Veterans understand how to check-in via their mobile device?
* How do Veterans feel about the proposed check-in solution, particularly the multiple modalities utilized (poster, text, then website)?
* What appointment information are Veterans expecting to review, in order to complete check-in?
* Once check-in is complete, do Veterans understand what will happen/what they should do next?

### Hypotheses: 

* 

## Method

### What method of research are you planning?

Remote, moderated sessions conducted on Zoom

* Usability testing with a UXPin prototype

#### Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?

* Usability testing will allow the Veterans to walk through each step of the proposed process, so they can provide feedback to each research question.

#### Where are you planning to do your research? 

Online, through Zoom

#### What will you be testing? 

UXPin Prototype TBD

## Participants and Recruitment

### Participant criteria: 

What are you looking for in a participant?

#### Primary criteria / Must have:

* 15 participants (for a minimum of 8 completed sessions)
  * Participants must use VA health care AND had an in-person medical appointment at a VA facility within the last two years (disqualify those that don't)
  * Participants must be willing to complete the the study via a mobile device (disqualify those that aren't)
* Please screen participants based on these questions:
  * Does the following statement describe you? I use VA health care AND had an in-person medical appointment at a VA facility within the last two years.
    1. Yes (Qualify)
    2. No (Disqualify)
  * Are you willing and able to complete this study on your mobile device?
    1. Yes (Qualify)
    2. No (Disqualify)
* Please confirm participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screen share
* Note:
   * For this session, we are unable to include those who use assistive technology, such as screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and ChromeVox).

   * For this session, we are unable to include people with significant vision loss.

   * For this session, we are unable to include people who use magnification tools.

   * The prototype being testing is in UXPin; this study requires using the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Internet Explorer and Edge are not supported.

#### Secondary criteria / Would like to have

* At least 1 woman
* At least 1 person of color
* At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
* At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
* At least one person that has no college experience 
* At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
* At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
* At least one participant that has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.
* At least one non-native English speaker

## When?

### Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 

(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.)

* Jun 23 - 25

### When will the thing you are testing be ready?

June 11

### Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 

(This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

* 30 minutes, 30 minute buffer between sessions

### Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? 

Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S. Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.

* Wed, June 23; 9 am - 1 pm ET, 5 - 7 pm ET
* Thu, Jun 24; 9 am - 12:30 EST, 1:30 - 5 pm ET
* Fri, Jun 25; 9 - 10:30 am EST, Noon - 2 pm ET, 3:30 - 5 pm ET

### Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. 

* Monday, June 21; Time TBD 

### Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?

* TBD
