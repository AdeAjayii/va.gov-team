# Check-in MVP Usability

## Background & Goals

### Background

This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. One portion of the ecosystem enables Veterans to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via va.gov.

With this round of research, we are looking to test the usability and design of the proposed check-in MVP.

### Research questions
- Do Veterans understand how to check-in via their mobile device?
- How do Veterans feel about the proposed check-in solution, particularly the multiple modalities utilized (text, then website)?
- What appointment information are Veterans expecting to review, in order to complete check-in?
- Once check-in is complete, do Veterans understand what will happen/what they should do next, or how to get help if they are having trouble checking in?

### Hypotheses to be tested
- Veterans will be able to complete check-in on their mobile device.
- Due to our authentication method, Veterans will have no problems jumping from text to website to complete check-in.
- Since Veterans are at the VA facility, they only need a few pieces of appointment information during the check-in process.
- Veterans will have enough information to know what to do next or where to go if they do have questions.

## Methodology

### Method and detailed research questions
We conducted 10 remote moderated usability tests (using a poster, Twilio, and staging) via Zoom utilizing the Perigean contract. The complete conversation guide with all the detailed research questions asked can be found on the [VA’s GitHUB](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/mvp-usability).
