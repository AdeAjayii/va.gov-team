This research study was attempted, but it proved difficult to have MSAs help us gather feedback. As a result, we changed methodologies and planned an on-site visit to gather this feedback. The new research plan can be found [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/StLouis-pilot-feedback).
