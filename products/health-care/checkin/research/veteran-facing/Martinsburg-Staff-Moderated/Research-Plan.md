# Research Plan MVP site staff help us gather feedback from Veterans
## Background
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The healthcare experience team in particular is creating the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via VA.gov. 

With this round of research, we are looking to validate the updated release of our MVP  with real users checking in and staff. Updated functionality includes additional identity verification steps, read-only contact information, checking in for multiple appointments, and the use of the revised poster throughout this process. 

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following objectives:
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Increase the completion rate of online transactions
- Increase usage of digital, self-service tools 
- Decrease time to successfully complete and submit online transactions

### Veteran Journey
The veteran check-in for a medical appointment fits within the "Taking Care of Myself" of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?

### Methodology
Staff at the MVP site(s) will ask Veterans a series of questions ideally towards the end of their appointment (maybe at checkout), so the Veteran can provide feedback on their mobile check-in experience. However, it is up to the MVP site to determine when in their workflow these questions can fit. If this needs to occur prior to an appointment or at some other point that is absolutely fine. _The site should just let the check-in team know what was decided._

### Recruitment
Staff should try to get feedback from:  
- 1 Veteran who completed check-in on their mobile phone per day
- 1 Veteran who did not check-in on their mobile phone per day
- _Staff should not worry about getting feedback from every patient during this evaluation._

Expect to include the following Martingsburg Clinics:
  - MWV MED HEM BM 4B112
  - MWV MED HEM/ONC MD 1 4B112
  - MWV MED HEM PA 1 4B112
  - MWV MED CHEMO PROCE RN 4B112
  - MWV MED HEM NURSING 4B112

### When? What dates do you plan to do research?
To be determined between MVP site and check-in team. Ideally beginning less than two weeks after launch.

### How staff should document feedback
Feedback should be anonymous. Do not collect names or other identifiable information.

Preferred Collection Method 
- The staff can utilize an online form tool hosted through Optimal Workshop. 

Backup Collection Method
- If for some reason the form tool is not approved or unaccessible, the backup method would be an interactive PDF, such as this [interactive PDF](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/6850668/MVP.PilotEvaluation-Feedback.pdf) to capture the feedback from the patient. Staff fills out the documentation.
- Corey Parker will periodically message the MVP site to gather the feedback documents.
- If staff would prefer another document type or process to gather feedback, message Kristen.Mcconnell@va.gov with details.

### Conversation Guide (Questions to ask Veterans)
- Did you check-in for your appointment on your mobile phone today?
  - If the Veteran answer "no" or "I don't remember," ask the following questions:
    - Did you see a poster [name the location of the poster at MVP site letting you know that you could use your mobile phone to check-in?
      - If yes, was there a reason that you did not check-in on your mobile phone?
    - Thank you very much for your feedback.  
  - If the Veteran answers "yes," ask the following questions:
    - On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process to another Veteran?
      - Why? What are your impressions of the experience?
      - What did you like and dislike about the experience?
      - Do you have any other feedback on checking in via your mobile phone?
