# Check-in Research Plan for a Moderated Appointment Information Card Sort

(Think about an Optimal Sort survey instead with Matrixes and Ranking questions. Look at Cindy's old study.)

Date: August 16, 2022

## Background 

The Modernized Check-In Team is reimaging the experience between a Veteran scheduling a medical appointment and having their appointment. In particular, the Modernized Check-In Team has created the portion of the ecosystem that enables Veterans to utilize their smartphone to “check in” to their appointments through VA.gov, which lets the VA know the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Check-in enables Veterans with appointments to: 

- Review and confirm their information prior to an appointment, also known as pre-check-in, which includes: 

  - Confirming their appointment
  - Reviewing their contact information 
  - Reviewing their emergency contact information
  - Reviewing their next of kin information 

- Utilize their smartphone to check-in on the day of their appointment

In speaking with the [Beneficiary Travel Reimbursement Path Analysis Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/104), we also know that travel reimbursement is being considered for integration with the check-in product. The following draft mock ups have been created to communicate the workflow:

### OCTO Objectives 

This research plan supports the following OCTO objectives: 

- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Increase completion rate of online transactions
- Increase usage of digital self-service tools
- Decrease time to successfully complete and submit online transactions 

### Veteran Journey

This research plan maps to the following moment within the Veteran journey:

## Research Goals
Check-in has expanded our access to more appointment data, which we can display to Veterans within the check-in and pre-check-in experiences. The list of all appointment data that we can now display includes:
- clinic name
- facility name
- date
- time
- provider's name 
- type of care 
- location (floor and roon numbers)
- address
- modality (in-person, telephone, etc)

The goal for this study is to identify what appointment data is most important within certain portions of the day of check-in and pre-check-in experiences. 

The mobile app and VAOS teams have completed similiar studies. Once our check-in appointment information card sort is complete, we will compare all of the studies to determine where we can align with the other products and where we need to differ due to unique check-in needs. 

Ultimately, we would like to determine what appointment data and the hierarchy of the appointment data displayed within day of check-in and pre-check-in as well as the hierarchy of that 

### Research Questions

- What appointment information is important to review when determining what appointment Veterans need to check-in for? 
  - In this scenario, how do Veterans rank the importance of each appointment data item?
- What appointment information is important to review when check-in is complete, but the Veteran wants to know what to do next?
  - In this scenario, how do Veterans rank the importance of each appointment data item?
- What appointment information is importatnt to review when trying to understand what appointment Veterans are completing pre-check-in for?
  - In this scenario, how do Veterans rank the importance of each appointment data item?
- What appointment information is important to review when pre-check-in is complete, but the Veteran wants to know what to do next?
  - In this scenario, how do Veterans rank the importance of each appointment data item?

### Hypotheses 



## Methods + Tools

### Closed Card Sort (remote, moderated)

#### What it is

*In a closed card sort, participants are asked to sort topics from content within your website into predefined categories. A closed card sort works best when you are working with a predefined set of categories, and you want to learn how users sort content items into each category. [Usability.gov - Card Sorting](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html)*

[Card Sorting - Methods 18F](https://methods.18f.gov/validate/card-sorting/)


#### Method

Using Optimal Workshop, we would like to conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will receive a link to a card sort activity that contains a list of about ? pieces of available appointment information that could be displayed with the check-in and pre-check-in experiences. Each participant sorts the content cards into one of several fixed categories (i.e., Health, Benefits, etc). They will also be able to add new categories if they feel that a card doesn't fit into the provided categories.

We would like to get complete sorting responses from **at least 30 Veterans**, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA). Each cohort will access the study using a unique URL.

* The [cards for this study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/closed%20card%20sort/closed-card-sort-categories-and-card-list.md#card-list-for-closed-card-sort) are (with a couple exceptions) the same cards that were included in the [Open Card Sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-Sort-Research-Plan.md), but with reworked descriptions for clarity).
* The [categories for this study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/closed%20card%20sort/closed-card-sort-categories-and-card-list.md#categories-for-closed-card-sort) were based on the [findings from the Open Card Sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-sort-research-report.md), a review of the current VA.gov website structure, and conversations with teams on the VA.gov side about future IA efforts).

### Coordination with Perigean

To assess potential participants' experiences with VA benefits or services, please use their answers to the Digital Service at VA User Research Participant Recruiting Screener Questionnaire question _Which VA benefits or services do you have any experience with?"_.

We will provide an [email template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/closed%20card%20sort/closed-card-sort-outreach-email.md) and a unique card sort activity link for Perigean to use when reaching out to each cohort of potential participants.

We will include a required field at the beginning of the card sort to collect a code from each participant. We expect Perigean to generate and provide a unique code to each participant for tracking completion and compensation. In order to minimize abandonment, please make very clear to participants that they need to use this code when they start the card sort.

We estimate it will take participants 15 minutes or less to complete the card sort.


## Closed Card Sort Protocol

#### OptimalWorkshop.com Test

* **Welcome**
    *Welcome to this online activity, and thank you for agreeing to participate!
    * The activity shouldn't take longer than 10 to 15 minutes to complete.
    * Your response will help us to organize the content in the VA mobile app. Find out how on the next page
   
* **Pre-Study intro**
    * Before we begin... Today we’re going to ask you to think about VA benefits and services.

* **Pre-Study Question**
    * First, please enter the unique code provided to you by Perigean during the recruitment process.

* **Instructions**
    * Take a look at the list of cards on the left.
    * We'd like you to **sort those cards into groups** that make sense to you:
     * **Use the groups provided**, or
     * If a card doesn't fit the provided groups, **create your own groups** by dragging and dropping a card from the left into the empty space on the right (and then give it a name of your own).
    * If there are any cards you find confusing, make note of them.
    * There is no right or wrong answer. Just do what comes naturally. When you're done click "Finished" at the top right.

* **Thank You**
    * You’re all done!  Thanks again for your participation. Your feedback is incredibly useful in helping to determine how our content should be organized, so we can make the VA mobile app easier to use.

* **Questionnaire**
    * Were there any categories that you didn’t understand? Yes/No
        * If Yes:Checkbox Options: Health, Benefits, Payments, Account, General VA Info, None
        * If no
    * Were there any cards where you felt uncertain about what category to place them in? 
    * Have you used the VA mobile app?
    * You may now  close this window. 



## Timeline
