# Check-in Research Plan for a Unmoderated Appointment Information Survey

Date: August 19, 2022

## Background 

The Modernized Check-In Team is reimaging the experience between a Veteran scheduling a medical appointment and having their appointment. In particular, the Modernized Check-In Team has created the portion of the ecosystem that enables Veterans to utilize their smartphone to “check in” to their appointments through VA.gov, which lets the VA know the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Check-in enables Veterans with appointments to: 

- Review and confirm their information prior to an appointment, also known as pre-check-in, which includes: 

  - Confirming their appointment
  - Reviewing their contact information 
  - Reviewing their emergency contact information
  - Reviewing their next of kin information 

- Utilize their smartphone to check-in on the day of their appointment

Within [another study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/travel-reimbursement-mvp-remote-test), we are actively exploring adding travel reimbursement within check-in product.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research plan supports the following OCTO objectives: 

- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Increase completion rate of online transactions
- Increase usage of digital self-service tools
- Decrease time to successfully complete and submit online transactions 

### Veteran Journey

This research plan maps to the following moment within the Veteran journey:

## Research Goals
Check-in has expanded our access to more appointment data, which we can display to Veterans within the check-in and pre-check-in experiences. The list of all appointment data that we can now display includes:
- clinic name
- facility name
- date
- time
- provider's name 
- type of care 
- location (floor and roon numbers)
- address
- modality (in-person, telephone, etc)

The goal for this study is to identify what appointment data is most important within certain portions of the day of check-in and pre-check-in experiences. 

The mobile app and VAOS teams have completed similiar studies. Once our check-in appointment information card sort is complete, we will compare all of the studies to determine where we can align with the other products and where we need to differ due to unique check-in needs. 

Ultimately, we would like to determine what appointment data as well as the hierarchy of the data displayed within day of check-in and pre-check-in.

### Research Questions

- What appointment information is important to review when determining what appointment Veterans need to check-in for? 
  - In this scenario, how do Veterans rank the importance of each appointment data item?
- What appointment information is important to review when check-in is complete, but the Veteran wants to know what to do next?
  - In this scenario, how do Veterans rank the importance of each appointment data item?
- What appointment information is importatnt to review when trying to understand what appointment Veterans are completing pre-check-in for?
  - In this scenario, how do Veterans rank the importance of each appointment data item?
- What appointment information is important to review when pre-check-in is complete, but the Veteran wants to know what to do next?
  - In this scenario, how do Veterans rank the importance of each appointment data item?

### Hypotheses 
1. Veterans and caregivers will generally agree on which data is most important in check-in.
2. Veterans and caregivers will generally agree on which data is most important in pre-check-in.


## Methods + Tools
We will conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will receive a link to an online survey that contains 4 scenarios in which the participant will prioritize appointment data. The online survey will be built in Optimal Workshop's survey tool, which is called Questions.

We would like to get complete survey responses from at least 30 Veterans and others (ideally 40-50), in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA).

## Recruitment

We would like Perigean to recruit 63 people using the cohorts below in order to get at least 30 completes (ideally 40-50). This study will be broken up into 8 mini studies, segmented by the 8 cohorts below.

### Recruitment Criteria (for everyone)

* ALL have a computer or mobile device and are willing to use it to complete the activity.
* ALL must have been to a VA health care facility for a medical appointment for themself or a Veteran that they care for in the last 12 months.

#### Screener Question

* Have you been to a VA health care facility for a medical appointment for yourself in the last 12 months? [“Yes” to qualify]

### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort A (9 veterans)

* All must have experience checking in via their mobile phone
* [Cohort A study link]()

### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort B (9 veterans)

* All must prefer to check in with a clerk at the front desk
* [Cohort B study link]()


### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort C (9 veterans)

* All must prefer to use a kiosk to check-in
* [Cohort C study link]()


### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort D (9 veterans)

* All have NO experience with VA benefits or services
* [Cohort D study link](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/vamobileclosed/?token=D)


### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort E (9 veterans)

* All go online to access VA benefits and services
* [Cohort E study link](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/vamobileclosed/?token=E)


### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort F (9 veterans)

* All are female
* [Cohort F study link](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/vamobileclosed/?token=F)


### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort G (9 veterans)

* All are male
* [Cohort G study link](https://adhoc.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/vamobileclosed/?token=G)


### Coordination with Perigean

We will provide an [email template] [Here is Cindy's email](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/outreach-emails.md) and a unique survey link for Perigean to use when reaching out to each cohort of potential participants.

We will include a required field at the beginning of the survey to collect a code from each participant. We expect Perigean to generate and provide a unique code to each participant for tracking completion and compensation. In order to minimize abandonment, please make very clear to participants that they need to use this code when they start the survey.

We estimate it will take participants 5 minutes to complete the survey.


## Timeline

The card sort will open on ? and should remain open for two weeks (Date?) or until there are 30 completes representing the recruitment criteria  (whichever is sooner).


### Prepare
* The survey link has been tested by several people on Date?.
