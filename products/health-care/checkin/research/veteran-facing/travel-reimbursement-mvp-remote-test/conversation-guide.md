## Moderator Logistics 

### 2-3 Days Before the Session 

- Review VA Platform’s [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions). 
- Perigean will send you the login instructions for using Zoom accounts for user research. The first time you use their account you will need to coordinate with Perigean on 2FA. 

### Day of the Session 

- After logging in, you will be logged in as a presenter. Be sure to enter your name. 
- Mute your Slack notifications. 
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/observer-guidelines) to your observers. (Slackbot will do this for you if you type “observer instructions” into #feedback-backchannel.)  

### Starting the Session 

In the Participant “More” menu, make sure “Play Join and Leave Sound” is unchecked.
In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except for the participant is on mute.  
Keep observers in the waiting room to ask the participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell the observers to have their camera on with full name displayed for a brief introduction to the participant when they are admitted to the session.
 
## Intro - 1 Minute 

Hello and thank you for joining today. My name is Ben. How are you doing today? 

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes. 

Today I'm going to ask you to do some specific tasks using a website, which is actually a prototype, that I will share with you in a few moments. 

Before we start, I want to go over a few things: 

- **First, I have some other colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes.** Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I wanted to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with letting them in for this session? 
     - *If “no,” ask the observers to leave the Zoom via Slack.*
     - *If “yes,” let other observers into the room.* 
          - And, here are some other members from our team. My team members, please say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth and mute your audio, that would be great. 
- **So, this session should take about an hour, probably a little less.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task. 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers. We are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We’re testing a website to learn how we can make it easier to use for Veterans. I welcome any and all of your feedback and I won’t be offended by opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason, and at any time, you want to stop this session, please let me know.**
- **Lastly, are you comfortable if I record this session today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, but the recordings are deleted after we complete the analysis. Also, none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. So, is it okay to record? 

Great. Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more. Okay, I’m going to start recording now.   

*Start recording. Select “record to cloud” so that the recordings are saved to Perigean’s account.* 

I have started recording. Once again, are you comfortable if I record this session today?
