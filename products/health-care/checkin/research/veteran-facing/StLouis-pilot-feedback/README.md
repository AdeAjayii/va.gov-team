### Key Findings

1. There's a large population of Veterans that feel they shouldn't have to use their phone to check in at the VA. However, younger Veterans and returning 1. patients have adopted the changes much faster. 
1. Pre-check-in was not widely used by Veterans because it's overlooked when confirming their appointment with VeText. 
1. Veterans were frustrated that they had to wait to check in when arriving early for appointments. 
1. The new poster addressing low vision concerns was successful, but requires additional testing with low-vision participants.  
1. If posters werenâ€™t in line of sight of Veterans between entering the clinic and walking up to the MSA counter, then Veterans often missed them altogether. 
1. Network and cell signal strength are variable between clinics. 3-15 seconds to receive second text message from VeText. 5-15 seconds for VA.gov to load. 
1. Work has increased for many MSAs as a result of helping Veterans with check-in. However, Veterans appreciate the help and have a much better first time experience.
