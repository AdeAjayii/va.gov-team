# Conversation Guide: St. Louis Visit to Gather Feedback on Pilot from Veterans

## Upon arrival to the clinic, speak with staff on how they would like us to intercept the Veterans
- Does staff want to do the initial ask? Can we?
- Should we not intercept certain Veterans?
- Talk to staff about hanging up the low vision poster(s) for our study (if not already used).

## Initial Intercept and Screening Questions
- Hi! My name is [Name] and I'm a researcher for the VA. We are here today to gather feedback on a new pre-check-in and check-in experience using your mobile phone.
- Would you like to check-in via your mobile phone?
	- If no: Did you complete pre-check-in prior to your appointment today? You might have received a text message with a link to review your address, phone, next of kin, etc. That is pre-check-in.
    - If no: Do you remember received a text about pre-check-in?
      - If no: Thank you. Have a nice day.
      - If yes: Understanding why Veterans aren't using the experience is also valuable to us, was there a particular reason that you didn't complete pre-check-in?
        - Thank you for helping us continue to improve the pre-check-in and check-in experiences.
    - If yes: Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about your experience completing pre-check-in? It will help us to continue to improve the experience for Veterans like yourself. It is completely voluntary. [Skip to "Pre-check-in Questions" section]
	- If yes: Do you mind if I ask you a few questions and observe you completing check-in? It will help us to continue to improve the pre-check-in and check-in experience for Veterans like yourself. This is completely voluntary.
		- If no: That is ok. Point them to the updated poster, so they can complete mobile check-in by themselves.
		- If yes: Thank you. I just want to let you know that if you want to stop my observation and questions at any point just let me know and we will. 
		    - Did you complete pre-check-in prior to your appointment today? You might have received a text message with a link to review your address, phone, next of kin, etc. That is pre-check-in.

## Pre-check-in Questions


## Observing Veteran
- Direct them to the poster, and watch them complete check-in.
	- Things to watch for:
		- Did they successfully complete check-in?
			- If not, what happened? Where did they get stuck?
			- Did the Veteran talk to the MSA/clerk for any reason?
				- Why?
Follow up questions

- Did you feel secure when checking in today?
- If the veteran didn't use a QR code, can we ask one more follow-up question here: "when was the last time (if at all) you've used a QR code?"
- On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process to another Veteran?
	- Why? What are your impressions of the experience?
Thank you for helping us continue to improve the check-in experience.
