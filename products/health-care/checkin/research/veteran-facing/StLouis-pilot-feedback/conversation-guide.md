# Conversation Guide: St. Louis Visit to Gather Feedback on Pilot from Veterans

## Upon arrival to the clinic, speak with staff on how they would like us to intercept the Veterans
- Does staff want to do the initial ask? Can we?
- Should we not intercept certain Veterans?
- Talk to staff about hanging up the low vision poster(s) for our study (if not already used).

## Initial Veteran Intercept and Screening Questions
- Hi! My name is [Name] and I'm a researcher for the VA. We are here today to gather feedback on a new pre-check-in and check-in experience using your mobile phone. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions and possibly observe you completing check-in? It will help us continue to improve the pre-check-in and check-in experience for Veterans like yourself. This is completely voluntary.
  - If no: That is ok. Point the to the updated poster, so they can complete mobile check-in by themselves. **[End session.]**
  - If yes: Thank you. I just want to let you know that if you want to stop my questions or observations at any point just let me know and we will. Would you like to check-in via your mobile phone?
    - If no: Did you complete pre-check-in prior to your appointment today? You might have received a text message with a link to review your address, phone, next of kin, etc. That is pre-check-in.
      - If no: Understanding why Veterans aren't using the experience is also valuable to us, was there a particular reason that you didn't complete pre-check-in?
        - Thank you for helping us continue to improve the pre-check-in experiences. **[End session.]**
      - If yes: **[Ask questions from "Pre-check-in Questions" section only.]**
    - If yes: Did you complete pre-check-in prior to your appointment today? You might have received a text message with a link to review your address, phone, next of kin, etc. That is pre-check-in.
      - If no: Understanding why Veterans aren't using the experience is also valuable to us, was there a particular reason that you didn't complete pre-check-in?
        - **[Ask questions from "Observing Veteran" section only]**
      - If yes: **[Ask questions from "Pre-check-in Questions" and "Observing Veteran" sections]**
  
## Pre-check-in Questions
- How many days ago did you complete pre-check-in?
- What did you like and dislike about the pre-check-in experience?
- Do you think it will change anything about checking into your appointment today?

## Observing Veteran
- Direct them to the poster, and watch them complete check-in.
  - Things to watch for:
    - Did they attempt to scan the QR code? 
      - If so, did they have trouble?
    - Did they seem to understand the low vision poster or have any questions?
    - How long did they wait to receive the check in link via text message?
    - Did they need to make any changes to their contact information? If so, observe that process.
    - Did they successfully complete check-in?
      - If not, what happened? Where did they get stuck?
    - Did the Veteran talk to the MSA/clerk for any reason?
      - Why?
- Stop the Veteran on the appointment list page, if they have multiple appointments listed.
	- What are your impressions of this page?
- Follow up questions (once check-in is complete)
  - Is this your first time checking in with this mobile experience?
  - Did you feel this check-in experience was a secure experience?
  - If the veteran didn't use a QR code, When was the last time (if at all) you've used a QR code?
  - On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process to another Veteran?
    - Why? What are your impressions of the experience?

Thank you for helping us continue to improve the pre-check-in and check-in experience.
