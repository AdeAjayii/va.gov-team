# Research Goals

The check-in product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The check-in experience team, in particular, has created the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to “check-in” through VA.gov (e.g., letting the VA know that the patient has arrived for their appointment). 

With this round of research, we are looking to gather feedback on the pilot release from Veterans across the St. Louis area. We are also interested in gaining insights into how to connect telemedicine appointments to pre-check-in and display patient record flags. Going on-site allows us to quickly interview many more Medical Support Assistants (MSA) and clinic management members compared to remote interviews.

The purpose of this research was to: 

- Evaluate effectiveness of check-in and pre-check-in experiences with Veterans and staff at St. Louis pilot clinics.
- Identify strengths, pain points and opportunities to inform product team and roadmap (as VISN rollouts begin). 
- Evaluate effectiveness of new poster that addresses low-vision concerns. 
- Gain insights and opinions on product naming.  
- Gain insights from VA staff on opportunities to integrate telephone appointments with pre-check-in and displaying patient record flags in VSE-CS. 

# Research Questions

- Are Veterans able to complete pre-check-in successfully from home? Do they understand the difference between pre-check-in and check-in? 
- What friction points arise for Veterans during check-in? How easy or difficult is check-in to complete on VA.gov? 
- What is the impact on the new poster addressing low vision concerns? 
- How do Veterans refer to the check-in process? 
- How do MSAs interact with Veterans during the check-in process? What impact does pre-check-in and check-in have on MSAs workflow? 
- What are the overall impressions of check-in among Veterans and staff? 
- How are patient record flags currently used by staff? 
- How would adding telephone appointments to the pre-check-in experience impact staff workflow?  

# Methodology 

From April 27-29, 2022, we visited St. Louis VAMC, North County CBOC and Olive Street VA Clinic to conduct intercept interviews with Veterans when they arrived for their appointment. We observed Veterans interact with the updated poster, complete check-in on their mobile device and asked follow-up questions. 

We also observed and interviewed a variety of VA staff who have a role in the check-in process, including MSAs and clinicians. We used a [conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/pilot-feedback/conversation-guide.md) to steer those conversations. 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans should be able to successfully complete pre-check-in from the comfort of their homes. Veterans will correctly assume that they still need to complete mobile check-in even if they completed pre-check-in. The pre-check-in experience improves the staff experience, since they need to review contact, next of kin and emergency contact information with fewer Veterans.<br>
    1. NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION: Most Veterans we spoke with did not complete pre-check-in. Therefore, there wasn't enough information to determine ease of use or perceptions about how it's related to check-in. However, staff said that when Veterans complete pre-check-in, it creates a more seamless check-in experience on the day of the appointment.

**MSAs see value in allowing editing of demographic information in pre-check-in.**

MSAs felt that allowing Veterans to edit their information in pre-check-in would expedite the check-in process. I.e., Veterans wouldn't be required to speak with an MSA if their information needs to be updated. In turn, shortening the line of Veterans that have to speak to MSAs on the day of their appointment. 

> _If the Veteran does pre-check-in, it saves us time. They should be able to update their demographic information in pre-check-in._

# Recommendations

* **Pre-check-in**
    * Explore opportunities to increase utilization of pre-check-in with Veterans (to ensure it doesn't "get lost.") For example, communicating the value to Veterans, test new text message variations, send the text message multiple times if not completed, send text message at a different time or day after confirminng their appointment, move pre-check-in link into initial text message, introduce email for pre-check-in, etc. 
    * Consider implementing editing of demograhpic information in pre-check-in.

## Who we talked to

9 MSAs, MSA Leads and clinic administrators
6 clinicians

Due to the intercept method used for this research, we were unable to collect demographic information that supports the VA's inclusive research guidelines. 

We spoke with staff from a number of clinics, including:

- North County CBOC, St. Louis (Primary care, wellness, nutrition, etc.) 
- GI Lab, Eye Clinic, OT/PT, Speciality Care Clinic (at St. Louis VAMC) 
- Olive Street VA Clinic (Women's Health and Dermatology Clinic)
