## How this research maps to the Veteran journey
- Taking care of myself
  - Checking in for a VA medical appointment

## OCTO-DE goals that this research supports
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Measures to increase
  - Completion rate of online transactions
  - Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Measures to decrease
  - Time to successfully complete and submit online transactions

## Background and goals
### Background
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. The healthcare experience team in particular will be creating the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via va.gov.
With this round of research, we are looking to test the usability and design of our proposed phase 2 features:
- the addition of last name and last 4 of SSN as identity verification data points.
- the ability for Veterans to check-in if they have multiple appointments in one day.
- showing a check-in status for each appointment.

In prior research, half of the Veterans were concerned that check-in only utilized their phone number to verify they were the right person checking in. We also found out that last name and last 4 digits of SSN were commonly asked to verify identity within current check-in workflows.

We analyzed appointment data (particularly looking at our proposed pilot site...Martinsburg WV) and found over half of Veterans have more than one appointment on any given day. With our MVP scope, those Veterans would not be able to complete check-in. We want to rectify that in Phase 2.

### Research questions
- Does the addition of last name and last 4 of SSN help the Veterans feel more secure about utilizing this check-in solution?
- Do Veterans understand how to check-in for 1 appointment via their mobile device when they have multiple appointments in one day?
- Do Veterans find value in seeing an itinerary of all their appointments for the day?
- Is the information provided in said itinerary sufficient, too much, or too little?
  - Particularly, are Veterans interested in seeing appointments that are past the time where they can check-in?
- Do the actions on the itinerary page align with Veteran expectations? Are there things that Veterans expect to be able to do from an itinerary page that they aren't able to do?
- Are the check-in appointment statuses helpful to Veterans?
- Would Veterans find repeating this process multiple times per day (for each appointment if they had multiple appts) burdensome or easy?

### Hypotheses to be tested
- The additional identity verification data points help alleviate some of the earlier security concerns that we heard from Veterans.
- Adding the capability to check in for multiple appointments throughout the day will not impact a Veterans ability to complete check-in for an individual appointment.
- The combination of a daily itinerary and statuses for each appointment will help provide clarity to the Veteran throughout their day at the medical facility.
- The Veteran might have additional expectations on what they could see or do on the itinerary, such as check-in for all their appointments for the day at once.
- Veterans might not initially understand why they have to repeat this process multiple times per day.

## Methodology
### Method and detailed research questions
We conducted 9 remote moderated tests via Zoom using the Perigean contract. The Veterans provided feedback using a poster, Twilio, and interactive UXPin prototype. They employed the laptop hugging method to enable easier transition and observations from the poster to text portion of the workflow. The complete conversation guide can be found on the [VAâ€™s GitHUB.
