# Research Plan for Pre-check-in Usability
Aug 2022

## Background
The check-in team is creating portions of the ecosystem that enable a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to pre-check in and check in for a medical appointment via VA.gov. Based on the previous research toward veterans and staff members, we heard that the e-check-in may decrease the long waiting time for some busy clinics if it functions adequately. 

With this round of research, we are looking to gather feedback on the pilot release of Spanish content and language toggle from staff through remote usability testing.  

To date, there are only a few studies that look into Veterans and their family members with either a  limited English proficiency (LEP) and/or who speak Spanish as their primary language. Within this study, we want to understand how LEP and/or Spanish-speaking Veterans :
perceive pre-check-in and check-in experience
validate if the translated Spanish content meets plain language standards
review the current toggle design pattern and test the new toggle design


## Research Goals	
1. Ensure the translated experience meets plain language standards for Spanish-speaking Veterans and bilingual staff
2. Understand the current check-in experience of Spanish–English bilingual veterans and their family members
3. Identify suitable toggle design for partially translated content (not site-wide).
4. Gather user feedback about simplified header and footer

### Outcome
We will apply insights from this research to improve and iterate on the pre-check-in and check-in experience for Veterans and Caregivers. These improvements will be included in the next release of the check-in experience.

### Research questions
1. Who are the users? What are user needs? Understand more about the veterans who are Spanish speakers and their family if they are involved in CI/ PCI.
- What is their demographic information? (age, familiarity with technology, language proficiency, etc.)
- Are there any family members who also use CI/PCI? (for example, assisting the patient or the family member who is also a VA patient?) If yes, what are their needs?
- What is users' language preference when using CI/PCI?
- What else Spanish content is preferred/required?  


2. What does a good CI/PCI experience with translated content look like for Veterans and their families with LEP?
	
- Spanish experience
  - Is the content easy to understand? Is it plain language?
  - Is the content concise/easy to scan?
  - Does the content provide enough information? Anything missing for non-English speakers/LEP?

- Toggle Design
  - How is the experience of the current toggle? How can it be improved?
  - How to clearly present the content when it is partially translated (not site-wide translation)?
  - Where do users expect to find a toggle on VA website if translated content is provided?
  - How do users expect to be notified about the new language function?


### Hypothesis
- For user background:
  - By talking directly with Spanish-speaker Veterans, we can gain insights that will help us best serve their needs moving forward.
  - We hypothesize that Veterans and family members with LEP may have specific content that's a higher priority to have in their first language.
  - We hypothesize that there is some content needed to be added to CI/PCI for Spanish-speaker Veterans or Veterans with LEP. (language support, communication with the staff member/provider, etc)
 
 
 
- For a good CI/PCI experience with translated content 
  - We hypothesize that bilingual veterans can complete CI and PCI when there is only English content. However, Veterans/family members with LEP need help with them.
  - We hypothesize that the Spanish content of CI/PCI may be accurate,  but may not meet  plain language standards 
  - We hypothesize that there is some content needed to be added for Spanish-speaker Veterans or Veterans with LEP. (language support, communication with the staff member/provider, etc)
  - We hypothesize that users find the original toggle design is discoverable but is confusing. They don't understand whether it translates for the whole flow/website or just the current page.
  - We hypothesize that users think the language toggle can but somewhere else because they don't need to frequently switch the language. 
  - We hypothesize that users may prefer to have the toggle at the bottom as long as we provide clear hints about where to find it.
  - We hypothesize that we only need to show the notification/hint for the first time user of CI and PCI.
 


## Method	
Remote, moderated sessions over zoom with bilingual Spanish-English Veterans and/or caregivers.
Use of Sketch for usability testing.  
Semi-structured interviews
Observational and task-based user testing


(Toggle design)
Impression testing to show the 2 version toggle designs  (put toggle at the subheader v.s. put toggle at the bottom of the page) for 5 seconds and ask for feedback. Then, usability testing and on a mobile device using sketch prototypes on the Veteran’s mobile device.
Usability testing will allow the Veterans to walk through each step of the proposed process, so they can provide feedback to each research question. This activity will allow the Veterans to clearly understand how to interact with the different toggle design so that they can provide more specific feedback about their expectations.

### Location
Remote sessions conducted over Zoom. 

### Research materials

Will provide later
	
## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research include Veterans and caregivers. 
We will use Perigean to recruit participants. 

We will use a lean maximum variation inclusive research strategy. 

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
12 participants (for a minimum of 8 completed sessions)
Participants must be a Veteran or the family member or family caregiver of a Veteran. 
We’d like a minimum of 8 veteran participants.

- Participants must speak Spanish and reasonable level of English proficiency. 
  - How well [do you/does your family member or caregiver] speak English?
  -  Not at all (Disqualify)
  - Not well (Qualify)
  - Well (Qualify)
  - Very well (Qualify)
- At least 1 person who doesn’t have a college degree (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least 1 person who has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.

**Secondary criteria (would like to have)**
Numbers based upon the [VA Recruitment Checker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing)
- Participants have used check-in and/or pre-checkin in English previously 
- Participants must be willing to complete the study via a mobile device.

## Timeline
Timeline: Our goal is to do this research in mid August.
Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)
Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 
1-hour sessions 
30-minute buffer between sessions
Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Keep in mind that VFS team members are also remote and live in different time zones. Try and keep research sessions during normal working hours.
Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?
