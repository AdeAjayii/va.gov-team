# Research Goals
The check-in team is creating portions of the ecosystem that enable a Veteran to use their mobile device to pre-check in and check in for a medical appointment via VA.gov. Based on the previous research with veterans and staff members, we heard that this may decrease the long waiting time for some busy clinics if it functions adequately.

With this round of research, we are looking to gather feedback on the pilot release of Spanish content and the language toggle from Veterans through remote usability testing.

To date, there are only a few studies that look into Veterans and their family members who speak Spanish as their primary language. Within this study, we want to understand Spanish-speaking Veterans:

- perceive pre-check-in and check-in experience
- validate if the translated Spanish content meets plain language standards
- review the current toggle design pattern and test the new toggle design

In this research study, we also want to:

- Ensure the translated experience meets plain language standards for Spanish-speaking Veterans
- Understand the current check-in experience of Spanish–English bilingual veterans and their family members
- Identify suitable toggle design for partially translated content (not site-wide)
- Gather user feedback about simplified header and footer

# Research Questions

- What are the needs and pain points of bilingual Veterans and their caregivers?
	- What is their demographic information? (age, familiarity with technology, language proficiency, etc.)
- Are there any family members who also use Check-in/Pre-Check-in? (for example, assisting the patient or the family member who is also a VA patient?) If yes, what are their needs?
- What is users' language preference when using Check-in/Pre-Check-in?
- Is there additional  content that’s preferred? 
- How easy-to-understand is the Spanish translation for bilingual  Veterans and caregivers?
- How well does the proposed toggle design meet Veteran expectations? 
- How clear is the Spanish pre-check-in and check-in experience for bilingual  Veterans and their families with LEP?

# Methodology 

Remote, moderated sessions over zoom with bilingual Spanish-English Veterans and/or caregivers. 
The study includes two parts. 

**Part 1 - Understand  pain points and assess Spanish translated content**
- - Semi-structured interviews
- User feedback translated Spanish content
- Screenshots of Spanish translated content will be shown to during feedback

**Part 2 - Understand toggle design expectations**
- Impression testing of the two different toggle designs  in the pre-check-in user flow and the check-in user flow
- Usability testing of toggle designs using sketch prototypes on the Veteran’s mobile device.
Sketch will be used

To manage the length of each session, participants will be divided into two of the above parts. 


# Hypotheses and Conclusions

- Veterans and family members with low English proficiency (LEP) may have specific content needs that may be missing in the current experience
“Likely True”, as some Veterans mentioned the need of having benefits information and medical terms in Spanish.

- The Spanish content may be accurate,  but may not meet plain language standards of Veterans.
“Likely True”, as some Veterans found some content was confusing and use difficault words.

- Veterans find the original toggle design discoverable but confusing.
"Likely False", as Veterans said it is simple and just hoped it   be bigger 

- Veterans don't need to frequently switch their language using the toggle.
Not enough information: Not enough information captured.

- Veterans may prefer to have the toggle at the bottom as long as we provide clear hints about where to find it.
"Likely False", as Veterans said they hoped the toggle just be on the top so that they can notice it easily

- Only first-time users need to see a notification indicating there is now a language toggle
Not enough information: Not enough information captured.


# Key Findings

## Spanish-speaking group

1. Most bilingual Veterans do not have a preference for Spanish or English content. However, some mentioned they prefer English because it is more precise and easy.

2. There are even differences between the cultures and languages in the Spanish regions.

3. The needs for Spanish content/service are not met.

4. Less assistance checking in with Spanish with MSA or kiosk.

5. The possible background of LEP Veterans. (second hand story)

6. Good care is less accessible because of the language gap.  (second hand story)

7. Tech using habits of bilingual Veterans.

## Pre-check-in and check-in interaction findings

1. High satisfaction rating on check-in / pre-check-in experience. However, some interaction issues were found.

2. Interaction Design issues that could also happen for general users

3. Bilingual Veterans have concerns about the consistency of Spanish and English when navigating the website.

## Pre-check-in and check-in content findings

1. High rating on overall clarity, but translation issues identified.

2. The translation of check-in and pre-check-in seems to be confusing.

3. There are some possible translation issues to look into because of Spanish difference.

## Toggle design and language function findings

1. For those who need the language switch, they prefer to have it on top because it's is easier to notice.

2. If a new language function is available on the VA website, Veterans want to have additional marketing methods, such as emails or texts.

3. Current version - a toggle above H1: clear and takes less clicking 

4. The design with a notification on the top and a language switch at the bottom least preferred because it is confusing.

5. The language switch as the subheader: noticeable, big, and takes less clicks.


# Details of Findings

## Spanish-speaking group

**1. Most bilingual Veterans do not have a preference for Spanish or English content. However, some mentioned they prefer English because it is more precise and easy.

5 out of 11  Veterans prefer to read in English because it's clearer compared to Spanish
2 out of 11  Veterans prefer to read in Spanish when practicing or when Spanish is the original language

Quotes

> “If it comes in English I'll be able to read it and understand it --- I don't have a preference if it's Spanish or English.”

> “Now, English. Since there are different dialects of Spanish, it’s difficult to understand.”


**2. There are even differences between the cultures and languages in the Spanish regions.

VA Need to be careful when translating for Veterans from different Spanish regions. 

Quotes

> “It gets tricky because words don’t translate to the other. So the dialects can be offensive if you are not careful.”

> “The fact that most misunderstand the fact that the Latin America is put into one pot. Someone raised in different parts it is so huge, its two different cultures and languages.”


**3. The needs for Spanish content/service are not met.

There is need for translating English into Spanish for family members.
Veterans need Spanish content, especially medical terms, benefit information.
Some locations have a heavy Hispanic population, but there aren’t many Spanish resources.
Quotes

> “Family member benefits. Since I am getting older, my wife won’t know what to do in their natural language. If my wife becomes a caregiver, she will have trouble navigating.”

> “I think every VA,  you have to look at demographics. If you look where we are and everything like that we need someone that speaks Spanish.”

**4. Less assistance checking in with Spanish with MSA or kiosk.

General check-in process and some screening questions are  asked in English: any fevers, last vaccine, etc.
The kiosks have no Spanish option.
Quotes

> "The format the VA has adopted for signing in needs to be corrected because they [ LEP Veterans and caregivers] are not as familiar [with English]. The kiosks is a problem for low level English speakers.”

> “My brother in law [is a Vet and LEP] has issues on what is available to him for benefits, there are a lot of options but the options are not clear enough.”


**5. The possible background of LEP Veterans. (second hand story)

Spanish-speaking Veterans may have good English ability when they are in the service, but they may forget English after going back to Spanish-speaking regions. Some LEP Veterans serve in locations, such as south America and Puerto Rico with more Spanish speakers


Quotes

> “Yes, there should have been some sort of English if you are a veteran but if you went home to speak Spanish for 50 years, can you really expect them to speak English if they have only been speaking English for years. “
> “Some people joined the military as a refugee, they didn’t always need to be speaking English so there is a barrier for those that are bilingual.”

**6. Good care is less accessible because of the language gap.  (second hand story)

Some LEP travel to the place where Spanish service is more accessible.
Quotes

>“My brother [is a Vet] prefers to go to Puerto Rico, He lives in Colorado...he transfers his information [when he returns] which makes it easier...”


>“If they say they only speak Spanish their care shouldn’t be delayed. Now their appointment is delayed and now you have to wait for the doctor. There is not a lot of thought process.”

**7. Tech using habits of bilingual Veterans.

Veterans mainly use Google Translate.
Some Spanish-speaking vets don't set their browser to Spanish.
People tend to find a language switch at the top or the bottom of the website. 
Quotes

>“I use Google Translate and it automatically translates.”


>“If I doesn't see a language switch at top of website, then I would go down at the bottom.”


**Secondary Findings

- Some bilingual Veterans don't know LEP Veterans or they don't talk about it.
- It is harder for elder Spanish-speaking Veterans to access Spanish content because they don't use smartphone.
- A visually impaired Veteran mentioned that the kiosk doesn't work for visually impaired Veterans.

# Recommendations

* Recommendation 1
    * Clarify content to better set up expectations related to next of kin, authentication, and that they are completing ‘pre checkin’.  
* Recommendation 2
    * Add emergency contact (review and eventually edit) into the pre-checkin experience
* Recommendation 3
    * Develop guidelines for how often we would like veterans to complete pre-checkin updates
* Recommendation 4
    * Evaluate staff-facing pre-checkin workflow, which may affect pre-checkin engagement in the long term
* Recommendation 5
    * Clearly explain where information gets updated across VA to better set up expectations for veteran, which may also help build trust
* Recommendation 6
    * Re-evaluate pre checkin being dependent upon confirmation and where it fits within the holistic appointment flow
* Recommendation 7
    * Better understand the authenticated experience and use cases to identify how best to set up expectations to fully authenticate when editing info. 


# Next Steps

Evaluate recommendations for long term (or post MVP) release with product teams. 


# Further research needed

Findings may not include the perspectives of the following underserved Veteran groups
Don’t have a degree 
Identify as Latinx, Biracial, Asian, +  Native
Use of assistive technology (AT)
We recommend studies with these underserved groups in the future.
