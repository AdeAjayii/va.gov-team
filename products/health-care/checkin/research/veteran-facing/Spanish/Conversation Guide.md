### Project-specific setup


## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to talk about how VA can meet the needs of Veterans and their family members and caregivers who may need or prefer content when checking in for or at the beginning of a VA medical appointment. We’ll also discuss the Spanish experience of mobile check-in and pre-check-in. We are evaluating the language switch interfaces.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
This entire session should take no longer than an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

[IF APPROPRIATE:] You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

I'd like to start now with learning a little more about your background.
- Do you and [your family/the Veteran] primarily speak Spanish, English, or another language at home? 
 - Can you tell me about your and [your family members'/the Veteran's] level of comfort with English vs. Spanish?
-In general, when you each need information, do you prefer to read it in English or Spanish?
 - Why or why not? 
 - Are there specific kinds of information or topics that you specifically prefer in Spanish? Can you tell me more about this?
- Can you tell me about any VA benefits or services that you, or your family members, use or have used in the past?
- Do you help your family manage any of their benefits or services or vice versa? Tell me more.
- Do you set your browser to Spanish or use Google translate? Why or why not? 
- Do you try to find a language switch when visit a website? Where do you expect to find it if translated content is provided?
- When you go online, what type of device do you usually use (like a desktop computer, laptop, or mobile phone)?

Now, I’m going to ask you to think about the tasks you do prior to a VA medical appointment, such as checking in, answering questions.
 -Are there additional content you think may be preferred / required for Spanish-speaking  Veterans? 
- Curious if you have interacted or know other Veterans or caregivers with low English proficient? (if yes), are you familiar with what their check in experience is like at the VA?

**Have you used pre-check-in or mobile check-in at the VA?**

**[If Yes: start the first task, and then the second task]
[If No: start the second task and then the first task]**


## First Task: Understand Spanish CI & PCI

**[If the participant is an experienced user, ask the following questions before the test.
If he/she is a new user, conduct the second test with new users first and then circle back to the first task. No need to ask the following questions.]**

- How often do you or your family members use PCI/CI?
- What went well? What didn’t go so well?
- Was it an English poster/text/website?
- How did you use CI, PCI when there was only English content? Did you use language assist?
- Have you tried the Spanish language toggle?
 - If yes, What do you remember that went well? What didn’t go so well? What would make it better?
 - If not, why didn't you use it?
- Now Spanish content is available. Which language do you prefer when using CI/PCIl? What makes it work better for you?

–Task start–

**[If the participant is belong to the PCI group]**
I want you to pretend that you have an upcoming appointment with your VA primary care provider via the phone and you receive the following text a few days beforehand. At this point, I would like you to share your screen, so we can see the text too. I will just observe you as you try to complete it. I'll ask you questions later. Please talk-aloud as you complete the task. And there are no right or wrong answers, I appreciate your honest feedback. 


**[If the participant is belong to the CI group]**
Alright, I want you to pretend that you have an upcoming appointment with your VA primary care provider via the phone. You see a poster at the clinic.

- Can you explain to me what we're looking at?
- What are your thoughts about what the poster is asking you to do?
- What, if anything, did you find confusing? Why or why not? 
- Is there anything missing?

Then, you text to the number on the poster. At this point, I would like you to share your screen, so we can see the text too. I will just observe you as you try to complete it. I'll ask you questions later. Please talk-aloud as you complete the task. And there are no right or wrong answers, I appreciate your honest feedback. 


### Things to observe
- Does the participant notice and use the toggle to the Spanish content? How does the participant use it?
- Does the participant understand how the toggle works without direction?

- On a scale from 1 (very unclear) to 5 (very clear), how would you rate the clarity of the content? Please explain.
- On a scale from 1 to 10 (where 1 is very unsatisfied, and 10 is very satisfied), how would you rate your experience with getting checked in? Please explain.


## Second Task: Toggle 5-second test
Now I'm going to ask you to think about a situation where you check in for an in-person appointment.  I’ll  be showing you 2 designs of a feature and will ask a couple of questions. I’m sharing the screen now. 

**(Show the slide of the first toggle design for 5 second)**
 you’d be showing them a couple of designs of a feature and ask a couple of questions.
- How would you describe the design after viewing this page?
- What grabbed your attention?
- What words or sentences can you recall?
- What would you change about the design?

**(Show the slide of the second toggle design for 5 second)**

- Can you tell me more about how the header and footer impact your experience?

Then, I’d like to talk about the language switch in the top section of the page and is under the VA header.
- What do you notice about the language switch?
- How do you think the language switch works?
- If you click on the continue button, do you think it will show an English page or a Spanish page? 

Now, please look at the second design.
- What do you notice about the language switch? 
- How do you think the language switch works?
- If you click on the continue button, do you think it will show an English page or a Spanish page?

- Where do you expect to find a toggle on VA website if translated content is provided?
- How do you expect to be notified about the new language function?


## Third Task: Toggle usability testing

Next, I'm going to ask you to think about a situation where you are doing CI/PCI.
