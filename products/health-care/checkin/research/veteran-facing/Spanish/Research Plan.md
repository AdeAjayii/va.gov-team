# Research Plan for Spanish Pre-check-in and Check-in  
Aug 2022

## Background
The check-in team is creating portions of the ecosystem that enable a Veteran to use their mobile device to pre-check in and check in for a medical appointment via VA.gov. Based on the previous research with [veterans and staff members](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/staff-facing/st-louis/pilot-feedback/CIE%20St%20Louis%20Pilot%20Veterans%20Research%20Report.pdf), we heard that this may decrease the long waiting time for some busy clinics if it functions adequately. 

With this round of research, we are looking to gather feedback on the pilot release of Spanish content and the language toggle from Veterans through remote usability testing.  

To date, there are only a few studies that look into Veterans and their family members who speak Spanish as their primary language. Within this study, we want to understand Spanish-speaking Veterans:
- perceive pre-check-in and check-in experience
- validate if the translated Spanish content meets plain language standards
- review the current toggle design pattern and test the new toggle design

## Research Goals	
1. Ensure the translated experience meets plain language standards for Spanish-speaking Veterans and bilingual staff
2. Understand the current check-in experience of Spanish–English bilingual veterans and their family members
3. Identify suitable toggle design for partially translated content (not site-wide).
4. Gather user feedback about simplified header and footer

### Outcome
We will apply insights from this research to improve and iterate on the pre-check-in and check-in experience for Spanish-speaking Veterans and Caregivers. These improvements will be included in the subsequent releases of the check-in experience. 

### Research questions
1. What are the needs and pain points of bilingual Veterans and their caregivers?
     1. What is their demographic information? (age, familiarity with technology, language proficiency, etc.)
     1. Are there any family members who also use CI/PCI? (for example, assisting the patient or the family member who is also a VA patient?) If yes, what are their needs?
     1. What is users' language preference when using CI/PCI?
     1. What else Spanish content is preferred/required?  

2. How clear is the Spanish pre-check-in and check-in experience for bilingual  Veterans and their families with LEP?

3. How well does the proposed toggle design meet Veteran expectations? 

### Hypothesis
We hypothesize: 
- The Spanish content may be accurate,  but may not meet  plain language standards of Veterans.
- Veterans and family members with LEP may have specific content that's a higher priority to have in their first language.
- There is some content needed to be added to CI/PCI for Spanish-speaker Veterans or Veterans with LEP. 
- Some content may need to be added for  Spanish-speaking Veterans or Veterans with LEP. 
- Veterans find the original toggle design is discoverable but confusing. 
- Veterans don't need to frequently switch their language using the toggle.
- Veterans may prefer to have the toggle at the bottom as long as we provide clear hints about where to find it.
- We only need to show the notification/hint for the first time user of CI and PCI.

## Method	

Remote, moderated sessions over zoom with bilingual Spanish-English Veterans and/or caregivers.
Use of Sketch for usability testing.  
- Semi-structured interviews
- Observational and task-based user testing
- Impression testing of the two different toggle designs 
- Usability testing of toggle designs  and on a mobile device using sketch prototypes on the Veteran’s mobile device.

### Location
Remote sessions conducted over Zoom. 

### Research materials

Will be provided later. 
	
## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research include Veterans and caregivers. We will use Perigean to recruit participants.<br>
We will use a lean maximum variation inclusive research strategy.

### Recruitment criteria

Primary criteria (must-haves) 
 
12 participants (for a minimum of 8 completed sessions)
- Participants must be a Veteran or the family member or family caregiver of a Veteran.
- We’d like a minimum of 8 veteran participants.
- Participants must speak Spanish and a reasonable level of English proficiency. 
How well [do you/does your family member or caregiver] speak English?
     - Not at all (Disqualify)
     - Not well (Disqualify)
     - Well (Qualify)
     - Very well (Qualify)
- At least 1 person who doesn’t have a college degree (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least 1 person who has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.
- Participants must be willing to complete the study via a mobile device.

Secondary criteria (would like to have) 
- Numbers based upon the [VA Recruitment Checker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit#gid=1440553662)

1. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 
     1. 1-hour sessions 
     1. 30-minute buffer between sessions
1. Availability: Between 9EST and 4EST Monday to Friday. 
1. Pilot: August 24, 2022
