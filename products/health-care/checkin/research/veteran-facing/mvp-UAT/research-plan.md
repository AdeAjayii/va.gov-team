# Research Plan and Conversation Guide for Check-in MVP UAT
August 2021

## Goals
### What product & team are you doing this research for?
VSA Healthcare Experience: Check-in

### Background:
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. The healthcare experience team in particular will be creating the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via va.gov. With this round of research, we are looking to get feedback the final MVP with real users checking in.

### Research questions:
- Are Veterans able to successfully check-in at their clinics when they utilize this new mobile solution?
- How do Veterans feel about the mobile check-in solution?
- How do staff feel about the mobile check-in solution?

### Hypotheses:
- Veterans will be able to successfully complete check-in on their mobile device. Success = The Veteran didn't have to talk to the front line clerk/MSA to check-in. The office knew they were in the waiting room and called them back for their appointment.
- Veterans feel the mobile check-in experience is a option that they will continue to utilize.
- The staff experience should improve due to shorter lines, but the impact to their workflow and experience with software should remain relatively unchanged.
  - First, we need to verify if VetLink can be continued to be utilized. We also need to understand the workflow of the pilot site(s) to really understand the potential impacts to the staff workflow.

## Method 1: Go to Pilot Site 
### Methodology and Recruitment
- 1-2 team members travel to the pilot site(s).
- Intercept Veterans at the check-in desk.
  - Work with MSAs at desk to determine best location/let them know what's going on, etc.
  - Ask as many Veterans with appointments at the pilot clinics as we possible can, while we are there.
- Watch the Veteran complete check-in on their mobile phone.
- Ask a few follow-up questions.

### When?
Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?
- TBD. 
- To coordinate with the pilot location.
  - Find out from pilot site what the busiest day(s) and time(s) are and try to complete this research during this time.
  - 

### Conversation Guide
- Prior to interacting with Veterans, take notes about the setup of the clinic.
  - What does the area look like? 
  - How many MSAs/clerks are available in the clinic? 
  - What is the staff check-in process like?
- When intercapting a Veteran...Hi! My name is [Name] and I'm a researcher at the VA. We created a new way to check-in using your mobile phone. 
- Would you like to check-in via your mobile phone?
  - If no:
    - Thank you. Have a nice day.
  - If yes:
    - Do you mind if I observe you completing check-in and ask 2 follow-up questions about the experience?
      - If no:
        - That is ok. Point them to the poster, so they can complete mobile check-in by themselves.
      - If yes:
        - Thank you. It will help us to continue to improve the check-in experience for Veterans like yourself. Direct them to the poster, and watch them complete check-in.
          - Things to watch for:
            - Did they successfully complete check-in?
            - If not, what happened? Where did they get stuck?
        - On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process to another Veteran?
          - Why? What are your impressions of the experience?
- Thank you for helping us comtinue to improve the check-in experience.
