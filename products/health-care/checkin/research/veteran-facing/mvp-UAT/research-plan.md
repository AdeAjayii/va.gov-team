# Research Plan and Conversation Guide for Check-in MVP UAT
August 2021

## Goals
### What product & team are you doing this research for?
VSA Healthcare Experience: Check-in

### Background:
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. The healthcare experience team in particular will be creating the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via va.gov. With this round of research, we are looking to get feedback the final MVP with real users checking in.

### Research questions:
- Are Veterans able to successfully check-in at their clinics when they utilize this new mobile solution?
- How do Veterans feel about the mobile check-in solution?
- How do staff feel about the mobile check-in solution?

### Hypotheses:
- Veterans will be able to successfully complete check-in on their mobile device. Success = The office knew they were in the waiting room and called them back for their appointment.
- Veterans feel the mobile check-in experience is a option that they will continue to utilize.
- The staff experience should improve due to shorter lines, but the impact to their workflow may vary depending upon their current workflows.

## Method 1: Go to Pilot Site 
### Methodology and Recruitment
- 1-2 team members travel to the pilot site(s).
- Intercept Veterans at the check-in desk.
  - Work with MSAs at desk to determine best location/let them know what's going on, etc.
  - Ask as many Veterans with appointments at the pilot clinics as we possible can, while we are there.
- Watch the Veteran complete check-in on their mobile phone.
- Ask follow-up questions (including Net Promoter Score).

### When? What dates do you plan to do research?
- To be determined. Coordination with the pilot location(s) needed.
  - Find out from pilot site what the busiest day(s) and time(s) are and try to complete this research during that time.

### Conversation Guide
- Prior to interacting with Veterans, take notes about the setup of the clinic.
  - What does the area look like? 
  - How many MSAs/clerks are available in the clinic? 
  - What is the staff check-in process like?
- When intercepting a Veteran...Hi! My name is [Name] and I'm a researcher at the VA. We created a new way to check-in using your mobile phone. 
- Would you like to check-in via your mobile phone?
  - If no:
    - Thank you. Have a nice day.
  - If yes:
    - Do you mind if I observe you completing check-in and ask 2 follow-up questions about the experience? It will help us to continue to improve the check-in experience for Veterans like yourself. 
      - If no:
        - That is ok. Point them to the poster, so they can complete mobile check-in by themselves.
      - If yes:
        - Thank you. Direct them to the poster, and watch them complete check-in.
          - Things to watch for:
            - Did they successfully complete check-in?
            - If not, what happened? Where did they get stuck?
            - Did the Veteran talk to the MSA/clerk for any reason?
              - Why?
        - On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process to another Veteran?
          - Why? What are your impressions of the experience?
- Thank you for helping us comtinue to improve the check-in experience.

## Method 2: Internal VA, GCIO, and Ad Hoc Veteran Employees Review
### Methodology and Recruitment
- Recruit volunteers to do production testing. 
  - VA (who have an association with this project), GCIO, and Ad Hoc employees, who are also Veterans.
  - Outstanding question: how do we technically make it possible for them to test the system?
- Send out complete information about the process to the volunteers via Slack or email.
- They will complete check-in on their own time, then answer a SUS survey.

### When? What dates do you plan to do research?
- To be determined.

### Conversation Guide
- Email/Slack content:
  - Thank you for volunteering to help us test the new mobile phone check-in experience. [Instructions on how to complete check-in.] Once you complete check-in, please complete the following survey by [date], so we can understand more about your experience: [survey link].
- Survey questions
  - The first ten questions are part of System Usability Scale (SUS), so they will be on a scale of 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree).
  - I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
  - I found the system unnecessarily complex.
  - I thought the system was easy to use.
  - I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
  - I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
  - I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
  - I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
  - I found the system very cumbersome to use.
  - I felt very confident using the system.
  - I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.
  - Do you have any other feedback about checking in on your mobile phone?

## Method 3: Pilot Site Staff Help Us Gather Feedback from Veterans
### Methodology
- Staff at the pilot site(s) will ask Veterans a series of questions ideally towards the end of their appointment (maybe at checkout), so the Veteran can provide feedback on their mobile check-in experience. However, it is up to the pilot site to determine when in their workflow these questions can fit. if this needs to occur prior to an appointment or at some other point that is absolutely fine. _The site should just let the check-in team know what was decided._

### Recruitment
- Staff should try to get feedback from:  
  - 5 Veterans who completed check-in on their mobile phone
  - 5 Veterans who did not check-in on their mobile phone
- _Staff should not worry about getting feedback from every patient while the pilot is running._

### When? What dates do you plan to do research?
- To be determined between pilot site and check-in team.

### How staff should document feedback
- Feedback should be anonymous. Do not collect names or other identifiable information.
- A printable document will be created that the staff can utilize to capture the feedback from the patient. Staff fills out the documentation.
- Corey Parker will periodically message the pilot site to gather the feedback documents.
- If you would prefer another document type or process to gather feedback, message Kristen.Mcconnell@va.gov with details.

### Conversation Guide (Questions to ask Veterans)
- Did you check-in for your appointment on your mobile phone today?
  - If the Veteran answer "no" or "I don't remember," ask the following questions:
    - Did you see a poster [name the location of the poster at pilot site] letting your know that you could use your mobile phone to check-in?
      - If yes, was there a reason that you did not check-in on your mobile phone?
    - Thank you very much for your feedback.  
  - If the Veteran answers "yes," ask the following questions:
    - On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process to another Veteran?
      - Why? What are your impressions of the experience?
      - What did you like and dislike about the experience?
      - Do you have any other feedback on checking in via your mobile phone?
