## Background and Goals

### Background
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. One portion of the ecosystem enables Veterans to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via va.gov.

With this round of research, we are looking to get feedback on the initial limited release of our MVP with real users checking in and staff.  Lastly, we are interested in understanding pre-registration more as well as  check-in indicators needed by staff.

### Research questions
- After a Veteran utilizes the new mobile check-in solution, are they called back for their appointment without having to talk to a clerk/Medical Support Assistant (MSA)?
- What is the impact to the staff workflow when Veterans check in on their mobile phones?
- How do Veterans and staff feel about the mobile check-in solution?
- Where within the facility should Veterans utilize VA.gov to check in for their appointment?
- What do MSAs need/want to be notified about related to check in (including pre-registration and insurance capture)?
- What is important to administration about pre-registration and insurance capture?

### Hypotheses to be tested
- The Veterans will successfully check in via their mobile phone, because the clerk and clincial staff will know the Veteran is in the waiting room without needing to speak directly to them. As a result, a nurse or other clinical staff will call the Veteran back for their appointment without first talking to an MSA/clerk.
- Clerks/MSAs should have shorter lines of Veterans waiting to check in, since Veterans will utilize this solution. They shouldn't need to speak directly to the Veterans who check in via their mobile phones, in order for the clinical staff to know the Veteran has arrived for their appointment. The impact to their in-person Veteran check in (Veterans who choose not to utilize the mobile check-in solution) workflow may vary depending upon their current workflows.
- There should be minimal to no impact to clinical staffs’ workflow on how they know a Veteran has arrived for their appointment.
- Veteran and staff responses will indicate that the mobile phone check-in solution is useful and does not negatively impact experience or clinical workflow.
- Veteran should utilize VA.gov to check in for their appointment when they reach the clinic check-in area/waiting room.
- MSAs and administration will have clear ideas on what check in indicators would be helpful to them as well as what is important for pre-registration.

## Methodology
### Method and detailed research questions
We traveled to Martinsburg VAMC and conducted intercept interviews with Veterans before their appointment. We watched the Veterans complete check-in on their mobile phone and asked follow-up questions.

During the same trip, we observed and interviewed a variety of staff members, who have a role in the check-in process.

The complete [conversation guide with all the detailed research questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/mvp-UAT/research-plan.md) asked as well as the [raw notes from the visit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/mvp-UAT/session-notes.md) can be found on VA’s GitHub.

### Pre-registration prototype
Staff members were also shown a [prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/e79a827e-42cf-4a82-b554-874c75b5c70e/a/Mya5Oob/play) to help guide discussions about pre-registration and insurance.

### Who we spoke with
- 8 Veterans and 2 caregivers 
  - checking in to the pain clinic
- 5 Staff
  - Pain Clinic MSA
  - Physical Medicine (OT, PT, Chiropractic) MSA
  - MSA Supervisor/Business Manager
  - MSA Trainer
  - Administrator

## Key Findings
- Pilot Feedback and Observations - Staff
  - Staff’s overall impression of the pilot was overwhelming positive.
  - The pilot has minimal impact to the MSA’s workflow.
  - The MSA still talked to most Veterans who came through the door.
  - If a Veteran has multiple appointments on a particular day within one clinic, there is interest in checking them in for all of those appointments at once.
- Pilot Feedback and Observations - Veterans
  - Feedback from the Veterans and caregivers, who attempted mobile check-in, was positive.
  - 2 out of 5 needed assistance texting or scanning the QR code.
  - All participants started to put their phone in their pockets or paused after texting “check-in,” because the SMS link took a while to return.
- Pre-registration
  - It is important to have up-to-date pre-registration information for the following reasons: sending medications to the correct location, “patient safety,” accurate beneficiary travel calculations, wellness checks, and knowing who the primary next of kin is.
  - Pre-registration is mostly thought of as the review of address, phone, email, emergency contact, and next of kin information.
  - Tracking and reporting on pre-registration changes is very important to administrators and could be improved.
- Things MSAs want/need to be notified about check-in (Staff indicators) 
  - MSAs want indicators about things that they need to take action on.
  - MSAs are interested in alerts, since the actions they must take are time sensitive.

## Detailed Research Findings
### Pilot Feedback and Observations - Staff

**Staff’s overall impression of the pilot was overwhelming positive.**

- “It’s going well.” - MSA
- “Staff love it. Love that it is a system that the MSAs already use.” - Administration
- “Couple of patients didn’t bother with it. Some don’t have smartphones.” - MSA
