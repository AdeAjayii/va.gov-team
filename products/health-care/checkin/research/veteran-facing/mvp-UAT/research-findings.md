## Background and Goals

### Background
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. One portion of the ecosystem enables Veterans to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via va.gov.

With this round of research, we are looking to get feedback on the initial limited release of our MVP with real users checking in and staff.  Lastly, we are interested in understanding pre-registration more as well as  check-in indicators needed by staff.

### Research questions
- After a Veteran utilizes the new mobile check-in solution, are they called back for their appointment without having to talk to a clerk/Medical Support Assistant (MSA)?
- What is the impact to the staff workflow when Veterans check in on their mobile phones?
- How do Veterans and staff feel about the mobile check-in solution?
- Where within the facility should Veterans utilize VA.gov to check in for their appointment?
- What do MSAs need/want to be notified about related to check in (including pre-registration and insurance capture)?
- What is important to administration about pre-registration and insurance capture?

### Hypotheses to be tested
- The Veterans will successfully check in via their mobile phone, because the clerk and clincial staff will know the Veteran is in the waiting room without needing to speak directly to them. As a result, a nurse or other clinical staff will call the Veteran back for their appointment without first talking to an MSA/clerk.
- Clerks/MSAs should have shorter lines of Veterans waiting to check in, since Veterans will utilize this solution. They shouldn't need to speak directly to the Veterans who check in via their mobile phones, in order for the clinical staff to know the Veteran has arrived for their appointment. The impact to their in-person Veteran check in (Veterans who choose not to utilize the mobile check-in solution) workflow may vary depending upon their current workflows.
- There should be minimal to no impact to clinical staffs’ workflow on how they know a Veteran has arrived for their appointment.
- Veteran and staff responses will indicate that the mobile phone check-in solution is useful and does not negatively impact experience or clinical workflow.
- Veteran should utilize VA.gov to check in for their appointment when they reach the clinic check-in area/waiting room.
- MSAs and administration will have clear ideas on what check in indicators would be helpful to them as well as what is important for pre-registration.

## Methodology
### Method and detailed research questions
We traveled to Martinsburg VAMC and conducted intercept interviews with Veterans before their appointment. We watched the Veterans complete check-in on their mobile phone and asked follow-up questions.

During the same trip, we observed and interviewed a variety of staff members, who have a role in the check-in process.

The complete [conversation guide with all the detailed research questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/mvp-UAT/research-plan.md) asked as well as the [raw notes from the visit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/mvp-UAT/session-notes.md) can be found on VA’s GitHub.

### Pre-registration prototype
Staff members were also shown a [prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/e79a827e-42cf-4a82-b554-874c75b5c70e/a/Mya5Oob/play) to help guide discussions about pre-registration and insurance.

### Who we spoke with
- 8 Veterans and 2 caregivers 
  - checking in to the pain clinic
- 5 Staff
  - Pain Clinic MSA
  - Physical Medicine (OT, PT, Chiropractic) MSA
  - MSA Supervisor/Business Manager
  - MSA Trainer
  - Administrator

## Key Findings
- Pilot Feedback and Observations - Staff
  - Staff’s overall impression of the pilot was overwhelming positive.
  - The pilot has minimal impact to the MSA’s workflow.
  - The MSA still talked to most Veterans who came through the door.
  - If a Veteran has multiple appointments on a particular day within one clinic, there is interest in checking them in for all of those appointments at once.
- Pilot Feedback and Observations - Veterans
  - Feedback from the Veterans and caregivers, who attempted mobile check-in, was positive.
  - 2 out of 5 needed assistance texting or scanning the QR code.
  - All participants started to put their phone in their pockets or paused after texting “check-in,” because the SMS link took a while to return.
- Pre-registration
  - It is important to have up-to-date pre-registration information for the following reasons: sending medications to the correct location, “patient safety,” accurate beneficiary travel calculations, wellness checks, and knowing who the primary next of kin is.
  - Pre-registration is mostly thought of as the review of address, phone, email, emergency contact, and next of kin information.
  - Tracking and reporting on pre-registration changes is very important to administrators and could be improved.
- Things MSAs want/need to be notified about check-in (Staff indicators) 
  - MSAs want indicators about things that they need to take action on.
  - MSAs are interested in alerts, since the actions they must take are time sensitive.

## Detailed Research Findings
### Pilot Feedback and Observations - Staff

**Staff’s overall impression of the pilot was overwhelming positive.**

- “It’s going well.” - MSA
- “Staff love it. Love that it is a system that the MSAs already use.” - Administration
- “Couple of patients didn’t bother with it. Some don’t have smartphones.” - MSA

**The pilot had minimal impact to the MSA’s workflow.**

- “It is still close to previous workflow.”
  - Already used VSE GUI
  - Still logs into VistA to timestamp that contact information is up-to-date
  - Uses ICB to update insurance
  - Communication with clinicians hasn’t changed; they still utilize Teams.
- MSA finds this to be “fun.”
- Net Promoter Score: 100
    - Total % of promoters - total % of detractors = net promoter score
    - NPS can be used over time to see fluctuations in the experience, but will not be the only user experience metric evaluated. Using only in conjunction with qualitative questions.
    - Only one staff data point so far.
    - Ranked 8 or 9. Didn’t want to give it a 10 “because it is so new.” Counting as a 9, which equals a Promoter.

**The MSA still talked to most Veterans who came through the door.**
 
- Reasons for this interaction
  - to promote the Veteran’s participation in the pilot
  - to complete pre-registration
    - Pre-registration consisted of asking one question
      - “Do you need to update any of your contact information?”
        - Sometimes examples of what was meant by “contact information” was provided.
      - 2 Veterans did ask follow-up questions to the contact information question. 
        - Is the address you have, X?
        - Do you have the X phone number?
    - No Veterans required an insurance review  on this day
      - MSA checked ICB in the morning to see who needed a review.
  - the physical space is very small and there isn’t a lot of traffic in this clinic
    - It would almost be weirder for staff to not acknowledge the Veteran, because the space is so small.
    - This also mimics their pre-COVID workflows. If a Veteran did check in with the kiosk, they still had the Veteran wave to let them know they were here. They just didn’t ask pre-registration questions if the Veteran utilized the kiosk.

**If a Veteran has multiple appointments on a particular day within one clinic, there is interest in checking them in for all of those appointments at once.**

- This idea came from the MSA participants.
- When a Veteran checks in in-person, MSAs currently check them in for all appointments within the clinic. 
- Two examples given were:
  - Nurse triage appointments, which occur immediately before the actual appointment with the provider
  - Within the physical medicine clinic, patients can have physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or chiropractic appointment back-to-back.

### Pilot Feedback and Observations - Veterans

**Feedback from the Veterans and caregivers, who attempted mobile check-in, was positive.**
- “That is easier than waiting in line...not having to touch a kiosk is a good thing.” - Caregiver
- 5 out of 8 attempted mobile check-in. 
  - 3 Veterans didn’t have smartphones.
  - Of those who attempted mobile check-in, 4 out of 5 were “successful.” 
    - One abandoned once they got to the VA.gov portion and saw that there were additional questions to fill out. “This is too much.”
    - One of the successes was they tried to check-in too late. 
    - 2 “successful” check-ins were completed by caregivers.
- NPS: 100 (2 Veterans gave it a 10).

**2 out of 5 needed assistance texting or scanning the QR code.**
- 1 Veteran needed guidance/instructions on how to send a text message.
- 1 Veteran successfully brought up their iPhone camera and scanned the QR code. However, they misclicked the link to create the text message and became confused on what to do next.
- This supports additional findings from the [Phase 2 usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/veteran-facing/phase2-usability).

**All participants started to put their phone in their pockets or paused after texting “check in,” because the SMS link took a while to return.**
- MSA noticed this similar trend on other days as well. 
- There was a lot of verbal instructions to notify Veterans/caregivers that a link would appear.

### Pre-registration

**It is important to have up-to-date pre-registration information for the following reasons:**
- **Sending medications to the correct location**
- **“Patient safety”**
- **Accurate beneficiary travel calculations**
- **Wellness checks**
- **If needed, responders are deployed to the correct address.**
- **Knowing who the primary next of kin is.**
- The accuracy of beneficiary travel is a big concern. Martinsburg spends 1.6 million a year on beneficiary travel. They spend a lot of bad postage, pharmacy, and police.
- No official metric mandated like insurance capture, but it is “supposed to be 100% and done at every appointment.”
  - Says Martinsburg has around a 90-95% successful pre-registration rate.

**Pre-registration is mostly thought of as the review of address, phone, email, emergency contact and next of kin information.**
- Insurance review is thought of as a related, but somewhat separate review.
  - While staff explicitly stated that they were two different things, only administrators expanded to explain why. 
    - Their one reason why was the gap that happens with beneficiary travel. 
      - Veterans claim they live somewhere that they don’t. 
    - Based upon things brought up during the interviews, we believe other reasons are:
      - updates being entered into two different system (VIstA and ICB)
      - different timetables for the review
        - Insurance every 6 months and contact information every appointment
      - reports and metrics mandated for insurance are more universal/standardized.
- When asked to prioritize the addition of pre-registration versus insurance in the mobile check-in product, all administrators and supervisors picked pre-registration.
  - When reviewing the pre-registration prototype, all staff agreed the information being reviewed was the most important (even with emergency contact and next of kin not being reviewed).
- Suggested additions or changes.
  - Temporary address (because there are a lot of snowbirds)
  - If the Veteran has an advanced directive, do they have any updates to it? - from the MSA supervisor.
  - The administrators were a little concerned that we weren’t having Veterans explicitly confirm each piece of data. Radio button next to each.
  - They also want the back button removed from the next page if a Veteran says that they need to update their information. 
    - They don’t want Veterans taking the “easy way” and changing their answer, in order to avoid talking to the MSA to update information.
  - Administrators thought both emergency contact and next of kin should be reviewed.
- Address changes are dealt with differently when they come through the beneficiary travel digital versus paper form.
  - If the addresses don’t match between a digital travel submission and what is in VistA, they go with the VistA address.
  - If a paper form is submitted and the addresses don’t match, then they investigate.

**Tracking and reporting on pre-registration changes is very important to administrators and could be improved.**
- Trainers at Martinsburg currently instruct MSAs to only update demographic information in VistA, since it is the only place that date/time stamps pre-registration and lists who did the update.
  - It is also done in VistA, so updates can be seen when a Veteran is admitted to the hospital.
- Administrators are interested in tracking 
  - if pre-registration has been updated or not
  - who completed the updates
    - Tracking who completed the pre-reg updates has been helpful when researching any problems that arose.
- Pre-reg report in BISL (Business Intelligence Service Line) is rarely populated with data, but has fields that administrators are interested in.
  - The BISL report (BISL- SCHEDUAD>SATReports>Appointment List_V02) was actually discussed for all check-in reporting and not just pre-registration.

### Things MSAs want/need to be notified about check-in (Staff indicators)

**MSAs want indicators about things that they need to take action on.**
- MSAs were interested in knowing:
  - if a Veteran started check-in, but didn’t complete it. 
    - This meant there was a Veteran that they needed to find, in order to finish check-in.
  - if a Veteran successfully completed check-in, because they would need to notify the clinical staff (unless the mobile check-in system eventually handles this handoff).
  - if a Veteran needed to update their contact information or insurance.
    - There was interest in a long-term combined demographic and insurance indicator.
- Even administrators suggested minimal indicators or notifications for front-line staff. They also wanted the focus on actionable statuses.

**MSAs are interested in alerts, since the actions they must take are time sensitive.**
- Due to the following reasons, MSAs want to be notified if a Veteran checks in.
  - MSA can have up to 6-7 software applications open at any given time, so they aren’t always monitoring VSE-GUI.
  - VSE GUI currently has only patient-centric views, so the MSA doesn’t have a view of what is happening across the clinic.
  - Some MSAs oversee check-ins for more than one clinic.
- When asked if a clinic view would solve this problem, the MSA said it would be helpful, but an alert that pops-up would be more helpful.
  - Particularly when overseeing more than one clinic.

### Clinic exploration for expansion

**Suggestions from MSAs and Administrators**

- Departments with good reception are in the front of the building
  - Dental
  - Urology
  - Podiatry
  - Cardiology
- Additional suggestions from administration
  - Transfer care management
    - Veterans who recently transition from active duty
    - Younger demographic
    - Area has good reception
  - Primary care #1 and #2
    - Good reception
  - Medical

## Recommendations and Next Steps
### Short-term changes to pilot
- Explore ways to notice Veterans that they aren’t done checking in after texting “check in.” Let them know that a link will appear.
- Think about ways to better guide Veterans through texting and scanning QR codes.

### Pre-registration suggestions 
- Implement pre-registration solution to support staff workflows.
- Prioritization of pre-registration and insurance components
  1. Address, phone and email 
  2. Emergency contact and next of kin
  3. Insurance
- Look into the need to incorporate temporary address and advance directive reviews in the future.
- Look into how beneficiary travel regulations on address discrepancies might apply to the check-in product.
- Talk about administrators more to understand the best solutions for pre-registration reporting.

### Things MSAs want/need to be notified about check-in (Staff indicators)
- Work with the VSE-GUI team to transfer the knowledge gained about staff indicators.
