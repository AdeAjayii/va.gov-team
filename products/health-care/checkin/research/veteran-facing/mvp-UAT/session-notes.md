# Martinsburg VA Trip - August 31

## Veteran Intercept Interviews
### Veteran #1 
- no smart phone

### Veteran #2 
- no smart phone

### Veteran #3
- Texted. Needed a little coaching.
- Link took awhile to load.
- Started to complain about the process when they saw the text with the link.
- Stopped when they saw the demographics question. “This is too much; this is pain management.”
- They were in visible pain, so I was just glad that they even tried.

### Veteran #4 
- Caregiver checked in successfully
- Scanned QR code.
- They assumed they were done after texting check-in.
- Feedback after seeing the experience:
- That is easier than waiting in line.
- Not having to touch a kiosk is a good thing
- NPS: 10
- Where do you expect to check-in. Check-in at clinic. Not car, because it would take me too much time (Veteran utilizes a wheelchair.)
- MSA still asked if they had any updates.

### Veteran #5 
- checked in when I was at a meeting with administration. Barb says the used mobile check-in and everything went well, except for the delay in the link showing up.

### Veteran #6 
- scanned the QR code on the clinic entrance door, so before they even entered the clinic. Didn’t have any problems, but we did tell them to look for the link.
- Suggestion from Veteran: instructions on how to scan QR code
- NPS: 10, but it would be less if they needed to talk to someone to update something, etc.
- Has had experience with another clinic here and it has bad reception, so mentioned that VA would need boosters, etc.
- After checking in, they asked if the doctor was on time and if they could wander for a little bit.
- Would prefer to check-in in the lobby

### Veteran #7 
- caregiver tried the mobile check-in. 
- They got the message that “We see you have an appointment today, but you can only check-in 5 minutes beforehand.”
- Caregiver like the concept. Their phone number is in the system for the Veteran.
- Veteran doesn’t like phones. Doesn’t like people having data on them.

### Veteran #8 
- No smart phone.

## Pain Clinic
### Conversation with MSA
- Overall impressions of mobile check-in: Going well
  - Couple of patients didn’t bother with it. Some don’t have smart phones.
  - We need to let the Veteran know that the URL is coming
- Impact to MSA’s work
  - Nothing major at this time. It is still close to previous workflow. MSA finds this to be “fun.”
  - Still logs into old Vista to timestamp that information is up-to-date
  - Already used VSE GUI
  - Uses ICB to update insurance 
    - None of the Veterans needed their insurance reviewed on this day. 
    - MSA reviews the ICB list at the beginning of the day.
  - Communications with physicians haven’t changed. They use Teams.
- Main Veteran confusion point: Waiting for the text response with the link. It takes a little bit, so the Veteran thinks that they are already checked in.
  - Witnessed during most Veteran intercepts as well. 
- NPS question: Likes tech changes, so she is game for this. Would give it an 8 or 9 - only since this is still new.
- This mobile check-in process made her more aware of time-stamping demographic updates.
- Ideally, the triage appointment and pain appointment would be linked, so the Veteran would check in for both at the same time.
- MSA still checks VeText for “I am here”
- Pre-COVID workflow
  - Didn’t have a lot of kiosk usage
  - If they did check-in with the kiosk, they still had the Veteran wave to let them know they were there. They didn’t ask any additional questions.
- Reviewing the prototype
  - It is valuable to see an indicator that a patient updated their information
    - Wants a combination demo/insurance review completed indicator
    - When MSA asked this information in-person, they don’t ask individual questions for contact information and next of kin. They only ask “Do you have any updates?”
      - They do ask about insurance when someone shows they need it in ICB.
  - Overall, positive feedback to still having Veterans go to MSA when updates are needed.
- Current process if a Veteran checks in, then leaves and doesn’t go to their appointment is:
  - Undo the check-in, then change the appointment to a no show.
- Asked how timing for too early and too late is determined?
  - No concrete formula, through trial and error 30 minutes seems to work to space Veterans out in the waiting room.
    - MSA stated that “Many Veterans come early, because that is what they are used to, so keep it that way.”
    - Triage nurse appointments were added to help with this timing problem and allow time for the nurse to meet with the Veteran.
- Need an alert that someone checked-in
  - Don’t have the calendar view up all the time.
    - They can oversee multiple clinics.
    - Even with a clinic view, I would need an alert to call my attention to it.
      - Might not have the clinic view up, since they deal with so many software systems.
      - Wants the alert to stay up until they look at it, since they aren’t always at the desk.
- Other MSA tasks besides check-in
  - Call patients back on the phone to answer questions, schedule appointments.
  - Schedules/reschedules appointments
    - Must schedule within 48 hours
    - Schedules return to clinic orders
  - Answers questions with Veteran face-to-face
  - Message with other MSAs and team members on Teams
  - Pull consult list
    - Either daily or weekly
  - Sends letters
  - On rotation to help with the ACD - automated call distribution line
    - They answer if a Veteran calls the facility, then routed to this department.
  - Measured on the number of dropped calls
    - VA metric requirement - less than 5% of calls can be dropped.

### Conversation with Business Manager
- Tweaks to current MVP
  - Cover triage appointments
  - Change to only allow Veterans to check-in 5 minutes after
  - Early time frame - 20 minutes due to COVID waiting room situations
  - Bad reception
- Would want to see a pop-up that demographics have changed.
- Would want insurance to be different/separate until we can scan the card. Otherwise, the Veteran will have to come up to the desk and scan their card.
  - Once we can scan the card, then one combined indicator would be good.
- They ask an additional question of if they have an advance directive, do they have any updates to it? - Need to verify this…the only time that I’ve heard that.
- Veterans have requested proof that they were at the VA for their employers. Brought this up when reviewing the appointment page - could that be used for this purpose?
- Thinks mobile check-in would be very helpful to MSAs; it will give them time to do other work.
- Thinks that we should specify that this is an option for checking in and not mandatory - maybe on the poster.
- They plan to still do Teams for patient tracking.
  - Not everyone has view in VSE GUI
  - PT/OT/nurses fo, but title 38s (doctors) don’t.
  - They tried to give everyone access and they got push back.

## Physical Medicine, so physical therapy, occupational therapy, chiropractic - visted area
- No reception. Dead zone, because it is near radiology. (I had one bar.)
- This group is part of the same group as the pain clinic. 
- They share a waiting room with nuclear medicine, orthopedics, and prosthetics
### Interview with MSA
- Uses Teams to communicate with providers
- Utilizes VSE GUI to check-in
- Asks Veterans if they have any changes to their personal information
- Uses ICB - Asks if hey have updates to their insurance that they want to share.
- What would you improve about check-in?
  - Some Veterans do not come to window and they get skipped as a result. They just come to the area and sit down.
- Providers have VSE GUI.
- MSA really wants an indicator to know that the Veteran is there. Isn’t as interested in a demographics updated indicator.
- They had patients with multiple appointments per day in one clinic. It would be good to check the Veteran in for all appointments in that clinic all at once. 
  - (This is similar to the triage nurse and pain appointment)
  - Patients can have physical therapy, occupational therapy, and chiropractic appointments together in this physical medicine department.
- Overall MSA structure in physical medicine
  - 3 MSAs split up the work
  - All share the consult list
  - 1: check-in and schedules consults
  - 1: in the back office on ACD duty
  - 1: check-out window, scheduling, and back-up on the phones

## Audiology - visited area
- This group is part of the same group as the pain clinic. 
- No reception. Dead zone, because it is near radiology. (I had one bar.)
- However, the set up of the area if better for a controlled mobile check-in trial. It has a designated waiting room. There is one way in and one way out.
- However, the patient population is older. Not as techie.
- They had walk-in and scheduled appts. prior to COVID.

## Possible departments/clinics to expand to next 
### Departments with good reception are in the front of the building (according to Barb)
- Dental
- Urology
- Podiatry
- Cardiology

### Suggestions from administration
- Transfer care management 
  - Veterans who recently transition from active duty
  - Younger demographic
  - Area has good reception
- Primary care #1 and #2
  - Good reception
- Medical

## Primary Care #3 (The other primary cares are on this floor) - visited area
- Main desk a dead zone for cell reception.
- Waiting area is for primary care only.

## Conversation with MSA Administrator and Trainer
- Overall feedback they have heard/personally have about pilot.
  - “Staff love it.”
  - Love that it is a system that MSAs already use.
  - I’m a Veteran. It is simple to use as a Veteran, but I worry about Veterans checking in from their driveway. How do we know that a Veteran is here.
- Feature request: Adding the ability for an MSA to send the Veteran a message that the provider is ready. 
  - This will cover the scenario of a Veteran checks in and leaves to get coffee/talk to a friend. “Vets wander off.”
  - It will cover the MSA that they tried to find the Veteran.
  - Maybe add to the poster “Please remain in the area until provider calls you.”
  - They noticed this was a problem when they had central check-in during the height of the pandemic. The system would say that the waiting room was “full,” but only like 4 Veterans would be there.
- They previously piloted restaurant pagers for check-in. It would signal to the Veteran when the provider was ready. 
  - The pagers only worked on one floor. Otherwise, they were out of range, so the pilot failed.
- Pre-registration 
  - It is important to have up-to-date contact information for the following reasons
    - Sending medications to the correct locations
    - “Patient safety”
    - Accurate beneficiary travel calculations
    - Wellness checks - if needed, responders are deployed to the correct address.
    - Knowing who the primary next of kin is.
- No official metric or number to hit, but it is “supposed to be 100% and done at every appointment.” Says  Martinsburg has around a 90-95% successful pre-registration rate.
- There are 4 different addresses
  - Confidential
  - Mailing
  - Temporary 
  - Home
- Beneficiary travel
  - Martinsburg spends a lot on this each year (1.6 million)
    - They spent a lot on postage to bad addresses, pharmacy, and police
    - They are currently working on a report about this.
    - Currently travel staff utilize BTSS, VistA, Bene Travel - VistA overlay
    - 35% BTSS success rate
      - Most do paper claim
    - Travel is based on the residential address in VistA
      - (Outstanding question: how do that work for snowbirds?)
      - If the addresses don’t match between a digital travel submission and what is in VistA, they go with the VistA address.
        - If a paper form is submitted and the addresses don’t match, then they investigate.
- Demo of pre-registration wireframes
  - Contact information is more important than insurance 
    - One reason given is the gap that happens with beneficiary travel.
      - Claim they live somewhere that they don’t.
  - Want radio button to verify that each data point is correct?
  - Maybe add temporary address, so the Veteran can review and update it.
  - They want a hard stop if the contact information isn’t correct. No back button.
  - They think both emergency contact and next of kin should be reviewed.
- They want to see who verified the information update CYA MSA
  - Trainers at Martinsburg instruct MSAs to only update demographic information in Blue VistA, since it is the only place that date/time stamps re-registration and lists who did the update.
  - It is also done there, so updated can be seen when a Veteran is admitted to the hospital
- A history of demographic updates would be great. 
  - Recent history in particular if case there is problems.
- Shown the BISL (Business Intelligence Service Line) tool, Pre-reg report
  - BISL- SCHEDUAD>SATReports>Appointment List_v02
  - Martinsburg Administrator want pre-reg monitoring here.
  - Columns available are the information that they are looking for, but they aren’t populated.
- Check-in staff indicators
  - Initial feedback was to have three indicators (next of kin, demo and insurance)
  - However, we then discussed needs for reporting purposes and what MSAs really needed to see.
  - They agreed that MSAs only really need to see items that they need to take action on.
    - “Provide us with a definition of pre-reg and have one indicator for that for the MSA.”
    - Basically, if our experience makes the Veteran review demo, insurance, and next of kin, then they only want to know if the Veteran successfully reviewed it or not.
  - However, reporting will need to be broken out more into those three areas.
- Overall check-in product feedback
  - Make sure that “already checked in” is both Veteran and MSA triggered.
  - They still want a kiosk type solution for Veterans who forget their phone or aren’t as tech savvy.
  - “Not a tablet. It would need to be a fixed device or they will walk away.”
- ICB information
  - There is an option in ICB for staff to mark that the Veteran
    - does have insurance, but refused to share the information.
    - doesn’t have insurance
- When discussing insurance capture in mobile check-in, “Don’t want the hospital to lose money.”
