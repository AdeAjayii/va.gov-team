# Conversation guide for Healthcare Experience Team, Pre-check-in Usability

## Moderator logistics

Use [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.

Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).

In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute

In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked

Check your \[screensharing setup\]

When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro

## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today, we're going to talk about all the questions you are asked and information you review when checking in for or at the beginning of a VA medical appointment. We’ll also discuss actions you can take prior to an appointment, such as canceling and rescheduling. We are exploring the possibility of enabling you to review and update this information as well as cancel/reschedule online in your own time from the comfort of your own home.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take no longer than an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We want to hear your thoughts about completing pre-check-in tasks from your home. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- During this session, we'll be doing two things:
  - First, I'll start by asking you a few questions about your past experiences.
  - Then, I'll send you links to pre-check-in prototypes that I'll have you review.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Review where to find chat and screen sharing with Veterans. 

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Now, I’m going to ask you to think about the tasks you do prior to a VA medical appointment, such as checking in, answering questions, canceling, or rescheduling.
- Do you normally check in with a staff member or use a kiosk?
  - What types of questions are you asked or what types of information do you review?
- What types of questions do the medical professionals (such as doctor or nurse) routinely ask at the start of your appointments? For instance, do they review your list of medications?
  - Have you ever completed any paperwork prior or at the beginning of your VA medical appointments?
    - If yes: Can you tell me more about the paperwork and what information it was capturing?
- If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, how do you normally do that?
  - What do you like about that process?
  - What don’t you like about it?
  - Ideally, how would you like to cancel or reschedule?

## Prototype - 40 minutes

Alright, I want you to pretend that you have an upcoming appointment with your VA primary care provider via the phone and you receive the following text a few days beforehand.

### SMS and first pass through the first pre-check-in workflow
At this point, I would like you to share your screen, so we can see the text too. Try to complete the task that the SMS is asking you about. I will just observe you as you try to complete it. I'll ask you questions later. Talk-aloud as you complete the task. Share your thoughts.

**Only stop them on the next of kin page**
- Were you expecting to be able to update your next of kin's information here?

Things to watch for
- Direct them to confirm if necessary/applicable
- Were they able to successfully complete the task?
- Were there any usability issues/points of confusion?
- General feedback on each item being reviewed. Were they interested in any item more than the other (or vice-a-versa)?

### Second pass through the first pre-check-in workflow
Now, I'm going to have you go back through pre-check-in again. This time I'll ask you some questions at each point in the process.

**Text**
- What are your thoughts about what the text is asking you to do?
- Would you add or remove anything from this text messages?
- What would you do next? (Direct them to confirm if necessary/applicable, then ask again)

If edit prototype,

    - If yes, where? Profile or with your other health questionnaires?

- What do you do now that you completed pre-check-in? Would you want to navigate anywhere else? What would be the next thing that you do related to your appointment?

## Post-Task Interview - 9 minutes
- Now that you've seen an example of what this pre-check-in experience could look like, what are your overall impressions?
  - _If applicable_ As a caregiver, is there anything that we should be aware of?
- What would you call this experience?
- Can you describe why you would be interested or not interested in reviewing these items prior to your appointment?
- Are there any other items or information that you would like to review and update prior to your appointment?
- Do you think you’d want to complete these updates on a mobile phone or desktop?
- Here we showed a text message, but how would you like to be notified that you have these pre-check-in tasks to complete?
  - Only once they answer, ask about each other type:
    - What about via
       - postcard?
       - letter?
       - phone?
       - email?

- If you could change one thing about the experience, what would it be?
- Do you have any other thoughts on what we talked about today?
- Any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minutes
We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us.

I have one final question for you. Do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
