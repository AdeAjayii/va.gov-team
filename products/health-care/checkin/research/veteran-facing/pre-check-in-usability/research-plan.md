# Research Plan for Pre-check-in Usability
October 2021

## Background

This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. To help streamline the day of check-in experience, the healthcare experience team is exploring the concept of pre-check-in. This would allow Veterans and Caregivers to complete a series of tasks prior to their appointment from the comfort of their homes.  These tasks will include:
- confirming the appointment
- reviewing contact information
- reviewing next of kin
- answering questionnaires

While pre-check-in is an unauthenticated experience, some of the above tasks (e.g. editing contact information) will require the Veteran to authenticate. This experience is new to Veterans Affairs, so Veterans and Caregivers will not be familiar with this pre-check-in user flow. 

The goal is to understand how the pre-check-in experience can lead to the following outcomes: 

Veteran-facing / Caregiver-facing
- Increase usage of mobile check-in on day of appointment
- Ensuring day of check-in is seamless 
- Increase in accuracy and/or quantity of pre check-in data, specifically pre registration information

Staff facing
- Administrative and clinical staff are more prepared for appointments
- Minimize the number of no shows, or confusion on the day of the appointment 
- MSAs can spend more time on other critical tasks
- Increased accuracy in veteran profile information 

This research will build off of [questionnaire discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/discovery/user-research/research-findings.md). During discovery, we found that:
- Filling out forms is not a pain point if Veterans believe the information will benefit the care they receive.
- Veterans believe that filling out digital forms before their appointment would decrease wait times and optimize time with care providers.
- A [prioritization study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/questionnaire/research/veteran-prioritization/research-findings.md) was also completed and Veterans did specify that they would like to complete the above items prior to their appointment.

### OCTO Objectives 

- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
- Measures to increase:
	- Usage of digital, self-service tools
	- Completion rate of online transactions
- Measures to decrease:
	- Time to successfully complete and submit online transactions

### Veteran Journey
The pre-check-in experience is an important part of moments that matter at different stages in a Veteran’s life:  
- Managing primary care and chronic health issues during their “Living Civilian Life” stage
- Taking care of my health during their “Retiring” stage
- Managing my declining health during their “Aging” stage

## Research Goals	
1. Identify the type of  information and how to deliver that information in the pre-check-in user flow to better meet Veterans and Caregivers expectations
2. Identify how to improve the content and user flow to make it easier for Veterans and Caregivers to complete pre-check-in

### Outcome
We will apply insights from this research to improve and iterate on the pre-check-in experience for Veterans and Caregivers. These improvements will be included in the next release of the check-in experience.

### Research questions

1. Identify the type of  pre-check-in information and how to deliver that information in the user flow to better meet Veteran and Caregiver expectations
- When and how does pre-check-in start?  
	- Does an SMS message align with how Veterans expect pre-check-in to be initiated? If not, what other touchpoints are preferred?  
	- How many days prior to the day of appointment should pre-check-in be initiated? 
	- What are Veterans expectations on the frequency of receiving reminders? E.g. 2 weeks, 1 week, 3 days
	- Should pre-check-in be contingent on a Veteran confirming their appointment? 
- Do Veterans have a preferred device (mobile or desktop) to complete these pre-check-in tasks? 
- How do Veterans respond to the need to complete a health questionnaire during pre-check-in? 
- Does the need to authenticate in the middle of the pre check-in user flow interfere with a Veteran’s ability to complete the task? 
- What are Veterans expectations on when and how to cancel an appointment? 
- How do the needs of the Caregiver overlap or diverge from that of a Veteran completing pre check-in? 

2. Identify how to improve the content and interaction experience to make it easier for Veterans and Caregivers  to complete pre-check-in
- How do Veterans distinguish between the following terms: Mailing Address, Home Address, Permanent Address, Temporary Address, Next of Kin, and Emergency Contact 
- Are Veterans expecting to be able to update their next of kin information or prefer emergency contact information instead?
- Do Veterans understand that updating their contact and next of kin information here will update it across VA?
- Are Veterans able to utilize the modal to update their address information?
- Does providing a read only version of the contact information page meet Veterans expectations? 
- Do Veterans have a preference (if at all) for a form list or task list of the pre-check-in activities? 
- What do Veterans expect to see on the confirmation page? 
	- Do Veterans know what to do after completing pre-check-in? 
- Does a Caregiver have unique needs that are not being met by the content and design? 

### Hypothesis
- Veterans will continue to find value in completing pre-check-in tasks based upon previous research.
- Veterans prefer to receive pre-check-in tasks via SMS texts. 
- Veterans will verbalize their preference for when to receive the notification that they have pre-check-in tasks to complete.
- Veterans will have a slight preference to complete these tasks on a desktop according to past research.
- Completing all pre-appointment tasks together, including health questionnaires, will be preferred by Veterans.
- Veterans will understand the difference between the address types.
- Veterans  will verbalize their preference or concerns regarding updating next of kin and emergency contacts within this workflow.
- Veterans will notice the informational banner at the top of the contact and next of kin pages, so they will understand changes made here will update their information across VA.
- The edit modal will impose no problems on the Veteran's ability to update their information; therefore, this pattern can be submitted to the design system for consideration.
- The need to authenticate in order to edit will introduce some friction, but not enough to deter Veterans from completing the task.
- Veterans will verbalize a preference for a form list or task list.
- The confirmation page provides enough information that the Veteran knows what to do after completing pre-check-in.The need to authenticate in order to edit will introduce some friction, but not enough to deter Veterans from completing the task.
- Caregivers should be able to complete pre check-in

## Method	
- Usability testing  on a mobile device using a UXPin prototype on the Veteran’s mobile device. 
- Usability testing will allow the Veterans to walk through each step of the proposed process, so they can provide feedback to each research question. Additionally, we can test the usability of the design and content decisions made in the pre-check-in user flow. 

### Location
