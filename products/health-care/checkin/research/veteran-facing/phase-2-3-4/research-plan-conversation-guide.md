# Research Plan and Converstion Guide for Check-in, Phase 2 & 3 UAT and Phase 4, October 2021
## Background
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a medical appointment. The healthcare experience team in particular will be creating the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via VA.gov.With this round of research

### Veteran Journey
The veteran check-in for a medical appointment fits within the "Taking Care of Myself" of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?

### Research questions
This research study should cover:
- How are the additional identity verification and multiple appointments features doing now that they are live at the pilot site?
- What is the impact to Veterans and staff?
- Usability review of the read-only contact information review feature.
- Usability testing of the revised poster.
- - Is the new poster solving the previously found usability problems or Veterans not understanding how to text and that they should wait for a link to appear in their test message to complete check-in.

### Hypothesis
- The Veterans will successfully check in via their mobile phone, and verify their identities without additional points of friction.
- The Veterans will be able to view multiple appointments for the day. 
- There should be minimal to no impact to clinical staff's workflow on how they know a Veteran has arrived for their appointment.
- Veteran and staff responses will indicate that the mobile phone check-in solution is useful and does not negatively impact experience or clinical workflow.
- MSAs are satisified with the read-only fields provided for contact information.


## Method	
- 1-2 team members travel to the MVP site, Pain Clinic, Martinsburg VAMC.
- Conduct intercept interviews with Veterans before their appointment.
- Identify best place in the facility to conduct intercepts.
- Work with clinic staff to determine best approach to intercept Veterans.
- Aim to intercept at least 5-10 Veterans as they enter the clinic, before they check in for their appointment.
- Watch the Veteran complete check-in on their mobile phone.
- Ask follow-up questions.
- Utilize Net Promoter Score (NPS) in conjuntion with qualitative questions to evaluate Veteran and staff experiences. NPS can be used over time to see fluctuations in the experience, but will not be the only user experience metric evaluated.

### Location
Research will be conducted at the Pain Clinic, part of a VA Healhcare Facility, in Martinsburg, WV. 
	
### Recruitment approach
We will observe/intercept Veterans during their visit.
