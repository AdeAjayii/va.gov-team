# Research Plan and Converstion Guide for Check-in, Phase 2 & 3 UAT and Phase 4, October 2021
## Background
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The healthcare experience team in particular is creating the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via VA.gov. 

With this round of research, we are looking to validate the updated release of our MVP  with real users checking in and staff. Updated functionality includes additional identity verification steps, read-only contact information, checking in for multiple appointments, and the use of the revised poster throughout this process. 

### OCTO Objectives
This research supports the following objectives:
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Increase the completion rate of online transactions
- Increase usage of digital, self-service tools 
- Decrease time to successful complete and submit online transactions

### Veteran Journey
The veteran check-in for a medical appointment fits within the "Taking Care of Myself" of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?

## Research goals
- Conduct user acceptance testing to evaluate if multiple steps in the check-in process are functioning as planned at the pilot location.
- Understand if the new poster is easier to use, addresses pain points from the original poster, and identify improvements (if any).
- Understand if the staff workflow has been affected by the implementation of new features.

### Research questions
- This research study should cover:
- Are Veterans able to utilize the new mobile check-in solution without intervention from MSAs? 
	- Are the additional verification steps clear to the Veteran?
	- How is the read-only contact information review feature being used?
	- How is the multiple check-in feature being used? 
	- Does the new poster addresses the following pain points observed from the original poster (if at all): 
		- Clearly communicates the need to wait for a link  to continue the check-in process
		- Offers guidance on how to send a text to initiate check-in 
	- Are veterans able to complete the task with the new poster? 
- After a Veteran utilizes the new mobile check-in solution, are they called back for their appointment without having to talk to a clerk/Medical Support Assistant (MSA)?
- What is the impact to the staff workflow when Veterans check in on their mobile phones?
- How do Veterans and staff feel about the mobile check-in solution?

### Hypothesis
- The Veterans will successfully check-in via their mobile phone, and verify their identities without additional points of friction.
- The updated poster successfully communicates the need to wait for a link to continue the check-in process and offers guidance on how to send a text to initiate check-in. 
- The Veterans will be able to view and understand the display of multiple appointments for the day.
- There should be minimal to no impact to clinical staff's workflow on how they know a Veteran has arrived for their appointment.
- Veteran and staff responses will indicate that the mobile phone check-in solution is useful and does not negatively impact experience or clinical workflow.
- Veterans who confirm that their contact information is correct will minimize the number of questions that MSA need to ask a Veteran. 
	- Note: MSAs should only need to review next of kin and insurance information for Veterans who confirmed their contact information.

### Location
The research will be conducted at the Pain Clinic, part of a VA Healthcare Facility, in Martinsburg, WV.
	
### Recruitment approach
We will observe/intercept Veterans during their visit.

## Timeline
Research: 1 full day onsite following the October 20th release.

## Team Roles	
- Moderator: Eva Floyd, Julie Adair 
- Research guide writing and task development: Eva Floyd, Kristen McConnell

## Method 1: Go to MVP site and observe/interview Veterans
###Methodology and recruitment
- 1-2 team members travel to the pilot site, The Pain Clinic, Martinsburg VAMC.
- Work with pain clinic staff to identify a high-volume day for researchers to attend, so we can maximize the numbers of possible intercept interviews.
	- Work with clinic staff to determine the best approach to intercept Veterans.
	- Aim to intercept at least 5-10 Veterans as they enter the clinic before they check-in for their appointment.
- Watch the Veteran complete check-in on their mobile phone.
- Ask follow-up questions.
- Utilize Net Promoter Score (NPS) in conjunction with qualitative questions to evaluate Veteran and staff experiences. NPS can be used over time to see fluctuations in the experience, but will not be the only user experience metric evaluated.

### Veteran Conversation Guide
Prior to interacting with Veterans, take notes about the setup of the clinic.
- What type of care is provided?
- What does the area look like?
- How many MSAs/clerks are available in the clinic?
- What is the staff check-in process like?
- How is cellular service?

Initial screening interaction
- When intercepting a Veteran...Hi! My name is [Name] and I'm a researcher for the VA. We created a new way to check-in using your mobile phone.
- Would you like to check-in via your mobile phone?
	- If no: Thank you. Have a nice day.
	- If yes: Do you mind if I observe you completing check-in and ask 2 follow-up questions about the experience? It will help us to continue to improve the check-in experience for Veterans like yourself.
		- If no: That is ok. Point them to the updated poster, so they can complete mobile check-in by themselves.
		- If yes: Do you have more than one VA appointment today that you have not already completed (e.g., pre-appointment labs)?

Observing Veteran
- Direct them to the poster, and watch them complete check-in.
	- Things to watch for:
		- Did they successfully complete check-in?
			- If not, what happened? Where did they get stuck?
			- Did the Veteran talk to the MSA/clerk for any reason?
				- Why?
Follow up questions

- Did you feel secure when checking in today?
- If the veteran didn't use a QR code, can we ask one more follow-up question here: "when was the last time (if at all) you've used a QR code?"
- On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process to another Veteran?
	- Why? What are your impressions of the experience?
Thank you for helping us continue to improve the check-in experience.

## Method 2: Go to MVP site and observe/interview staff
### Methodology and Recruitment
- During the same onsite trip as the above Veteran study, work with the site to schedule time to observe and interview staff members in the clinics that are utilizing the new VA.gov check-in solution.
- Try to gather feedback and observations from as many staff and roles as possible during the visit.

### Staff Conversation Guide
- Hello. I am [name] and I'm a researcher for the VA. We are here today to talk to you about the new Veteran mobile phone check-in process and its impact on your job. I would like to observe you checking in Veterans and ask you a few questions if that is alright?
- Things to watch for while observing staff:
	- Did they still engage and talk to Veteran who completed check-in on VA.gov?
		- Why?
- How has the most recent release of the mobile check-in impacted your work?
	- What do you like about it?
	- What do you dislike about it?
	- Did you have to change anything about your workflow to accommodate this new process?
		- Probe more into changes to tool usage and job duties as needed.
		- For MSA Supervisor Theresa: How has this mobile check-in process affected your supervisory duties and how you balance your team?
		- How do you know if a mobile phone check-in occurred and clinical staff have already been notified?
	- If a Veteran checks in via mobile, but is on the ICB list, how do you manage that?
	- How many Veterans check-in in the hallway before they enter the waiting room? Poster is on the waiting room entrance door.
- How has mobile check-in impacted the Veteran experience?
	- Has it affected complaints about long waits/Veterans in the waiting room who have not actually been checked in?
- On a scale from 0 to 10 (0 = Not at all likely AND 10 = Extremely likely), how likely is it that you would recommend this mobile phone check-in process be utilized at another VA clinic?
- What would you change about the new mobile check-in?
