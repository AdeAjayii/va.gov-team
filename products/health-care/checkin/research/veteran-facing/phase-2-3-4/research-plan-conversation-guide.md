# Research Plan and Converstion Guide for Check-in, Phase 2 & 3 UAT and Phase 4, October 2021
## Background
This product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The healthcare experience team in particular is creating the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to check-in (letting the VA know that they have arrived for their appointment) via VA.gov. 
With this round of research, we are looking to validate the updated release of our MVP  with real users checking in and staff. Updated functionality includes additional identity verification steps, checking in for multiple appointments, read-only contact information, and the use of the revised poster throughout this process. 

### OCTO-DE Objectives
This research supports the following objectives:
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Increase the completion rate of online transactions
- Increase usage of digital, self-service tools 
- Decrease time to successful complete and submit online transactions

### Veteran Journey
The veteran check-in for a medical appointment fits within the "Taking Care of Myself" of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?

## Research goals
- Conduct user acceptance testing to evaluate if multiple steps in the check-in process are functioning as planned at the pilot location.
- Understand if the new poster is easier to use, addresses pain points from the original poster, and identify improvements (if any).
- Understand if the staff workflow has been affected by the implementation of new features.

### Research questions
- This research study should cover:
- Are Veterans able to utilize the new mobile check-in solution without intervention from MSAs? 
	- Are the additional verification steps clear to the Veteran?
	- How is the read-only contact information review feature being used?
	- How is the multiple check-in feature being used? 
	- Does the new poster addresses the following pain points observed from the original poster (if at all): 
		- Clearly communicates the need to wait for a link  to continue the check-in process
		- Offers guidance on how to send a text to initiate check-in 
	- Are veterans able to complete the task with the new poster? 
- After a Veteran utilizes the new mobile check-in solution, are they called back for their appointment without having to talk to a clerk/Medical Support Assistant (MSA)?
- What is the impact to the staff workflow when Veterans check in on their mobile phones?
- How do Veterans and staff feel about the mobile check-in solution?

### Hypothesis
- The Veterans will successfully check in via their mobile phone, and verify their identities without additional points of friction.
- The Veterans will be able to view multiple appointments for the day. 
- There should be minimal to no impact to clinical staff's workflow on how they know a Veteran has arrived for their appointment.
- Veteran and staff responses will indicate that the mobile phone check-in solution is useful and does not negatively impact experience or clinical workflow.
- MSAs are satisified with the read-only fields provided for contact information.


## Method	
- 1-2 team members travel to the MVP site, Pain Clinic, Martinsburg VAMC.
- Conduct intercept interviews with Veterans before their appointment.
- Identify best place in the facility to conduct intercepts.
- Work with clinic staff to determine best approach to intercept Veterans.
- Aim to intercept at least 5-10 Veterans as they enter the clinic, before they check in for their appointment.
- Watch the Veteran complete check-in on their mobile phone.
- Ask follow-up questions.
- Utilize Net Promoter Score (NPS) in conjuntion with qualitative questions to evaluate Veteran and staff experiences. NPS can be used over time to see fluctuations in the experience, but will not be the only user experience metric evaluated.

### Location
Research will be conducted at the Pain Clinic, part of a VA Healhcare Facility, in Martinsburg, WV. 
	
### Recruitment approach
We will observe/intercept Veterans during their visit.
