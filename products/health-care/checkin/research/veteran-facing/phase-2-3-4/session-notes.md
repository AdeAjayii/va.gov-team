# Martinsburg VA Trip - October 26, 2021
8 appointments, 1 cancellation 

## Clinic Space
- 6 chairs, evenly spaced around 3 walls, small waiting room. 
- 3 check in posters hang: on the entrance door, on the check in window, and on the door entering into the exam rooms. 11 x 17 posters fit well, 36x48 was too large for the space. 
- cell phone service is weak but working, 2 bars on Verizon. 
- I sat at the desk behind the closed glass due to COVID protocol. 


## Veteran Intercept Interviews

### Veteran #1 
- no smartphone
- arrived 15 minutes early, checked in with MSA, answered screening questions, and found a seat taking less than 30 seconds total. 
- She asked if there have been any changes to his information, such as name, email, phone number, hair color, eye color, laughs. There were no changes. 


### Veteran #2 
- Greeted by MSA and checked in, then asked if he would be willing to also try using the mobile check in?
- He looked at the poster, and pointed to the QR code and said that he wasn't sure if he had an app for that. He pulled out his phone and sent a text. He received a response text. He flashed the text screen towards us and the font was very large, so large that it would be hard to see the full message on the screen. It didn't seem like he read the text message. 
- He mentioned that his cell phone connection wasn't very good. 
- He looked at the poster again then checked his phone. About 1 minute later, he received another text which sent him a link. 
- He opened the link, reviewed his contact information and said he could see his appointment.
- At that point he seemed a bit irritated and tired. It didn't seem like he was up for continuing so we stopped. 

### Veteran #3 
- no smartphone
- made a point of showing us she didn't have one in her hands. 
- answered the same checkin questions without any updates.

### Veteran #4 
- Walked in with phone in hand
- MSA greeted him, asked the same check in questions then asked if he would also be willing to try checking in with his mobile device. Note: MSA mentioned that this patient already used the mobile app a few weeks ago. 
- He held up his phone and scanned the QR code by the check in window
- He very quickly received a text about getting some information to start the check in process...
- Then about 30 seconds later he received a link, which he opened and stated that **it said he didn't have an appointment today**. The MSA confirmed that he indeed did have an appointment. He decided to refresh the screen. 
- Then it displayed his contact information, and his two appointments. He checked in for the first appointment with the nurse. The second appointment was 30 minutes later with the physician.
- On a scale of 1-10 would you recommend it? Well it depends on the veteran, not my father-in-law, he doesn't have a smart phone. I don't know. I'd give it an 8. 

### Veteran #5 
- no smartphone

### Veteran #6 
- no smartphone

### Veteran #7 
- Greeted by MSA, she checked him in. Then asked if he would be willing to try our mobile check in process.
- He pulled out his phone, and used the camera on the QR code. Described receiving a text about getting some information to start the check in process...
- He received a weblink, which he opened, entered some information (assuming phone and last 4 of social)
- He quickly came back up to the check in desk and **reported to the MSA that his mailing address was outdated**. The MSA captured the new address and he continued through the process by answering "yes". 
- He described both of his appointments were listed, checked in for the first and sat down.
- On the scale of 0-10, he gave it a 9. 


## Conversation with MSA 

Need to be alerted
- She rated it a 9, but said she wouldn't give it her stamp of approval to pilot at another clinic until MSA's received some type of notification once the patient has checked in. 
- - When patients check in by the app, she doesn't know. Its not often a big issue in this small space but it would be in a larger waiting room. She mentioned an instance where someone did that and sat down and they didn't see them. 
- The mobile check in experience is currently adding to their workload but once an alert system is in place, there will be a benefit. 

How much does timing affect your process? Can you check patients in early? Can you check them in late? Is there much of an issue?
- she doesn't have any restrictions on timing right now. They can be checked in at any point, however, if they are more than 30 minutes early they might choose to go do something else. With the app they can check in 30 minutes prior or 5 minutes after. 
- they are short two MSAs right now. One moved, one has a sick kid, so she's doing extra duties to cover the phones for them. 

Telehealth
- I noticed that the MSA placed several phone calls to confirm video appointments the following day with patients.
- She also offered to resend a link. 
- The MSA thinks video and phone appointments would be confusing if listed in the app with their in-person visits.
- They schedule lots of video appointments because of COVID to keep the physical space at reduced capacity due to COVID. 

Changes to MSA workflow 
- it adds more work right now. Because she still has to ask them what their name is and communicate via teams to the nurse that the are here. 

What would you change about the new mobile check-in?
- the desktop notification is needed. thats the biggest issue right now. 
- slowness of receiving checkin link has been an issue. The automatic reply has helped.
- coming soon....
