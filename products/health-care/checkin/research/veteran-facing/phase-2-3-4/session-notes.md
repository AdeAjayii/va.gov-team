8 appointments, 1 cancellation 

### Veteran #1 
- no smart phone
- arrived 15 minutes early, checked in with MSA, answered screening questions, and found a seat taking less than 30 seconds total. 
- She asked if there have been any changes to his information, such as name, email, phone number, hair color, eye color, laughs
- There were no changes 


### Veteran #2 
- Greeted by MSA and checked in, then asked if he would be willing to also try checking in with "the mobile app"
- He looked at the poster, and pointed to the QR code and said that he wasn't sure if he had an app for that. He pulled out his phone and sent a text. He received a response text. He flashed the text screen towards us and the font was very large, so large that it would be hard to see the full message on the screen. It didn't seem like he read the text message. 
- He sat down thinking he was done. 
- He mentioned that his cell phone connection wasn't very good. 
- 1 minute later, he received another text which sent him a link. 
- He opened the link, reviewed his contact informatin and said he could see his appointment.
- At hat point he seemed a bit irritated and tired. 

### Veteran #3 
- no smart phone
- made a point of showing us she didn't have one in her hands. 
- answered the same checkin questions without any updates.

### Veteran #4 
- Walked in with phone in hand
- MSA greeted him, asked the same check in questions then asked if he would also be willing to try checking in with the mobile app. Note: MSA mentioned that this patient already used the mobile app a few weeks ago. 
- He held up his phone and scanned the QR code by the check in window
- He very quickly received a text about getting some information to start the check in process...
- Then about 30 seconds later he received a link, which he opened and stated that it said he didn't have an appointment today. The MSA confirmed that he indeed did have an appointment. He decided to refresh the screen. 
- Then it displayed
