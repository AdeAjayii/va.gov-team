# Background
In general, there’s been an increase in telemedicine appointments, mainly due to COVID-19. This is often either via video or telephone.

After stakeholder feedback and feasibility discussions, we decided to focus on integrating telephone appointments into pre-check-in. 

We interviewed a VA provider and identified two potential pain points we wanted to address for our MVP. 

Pre-check-in is currently available for in-person appointments.

Veterans can review and confirm: 
- contact information
- emergency contact
- next of kin

We built an MVP for pre-check-in for telephone appointments.

Our MVP addresses two potential pain points (based on an [interview with VA provider](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/discovery/telephone-appointments/staff-interviews/interview-notes.md)): 
- Veterans show up on-site, confusing telephone appointments for in-person
- Providers may be late and often don’t call at the appointment time

# Research Goals
- Validate our MVP:
  - Clearly state it’s a telephone appointment
  - Set expectations with a Veteran that a provider may join the appointment late
- Understand Veteran’s current experience with telephone appointments 
- Clarity of the “too late” message – this is when a Veteran tries to complete pre-check-in after midnight on the day of their appointment
  - This is a key part of the PCI design that we haven’t tested before.
