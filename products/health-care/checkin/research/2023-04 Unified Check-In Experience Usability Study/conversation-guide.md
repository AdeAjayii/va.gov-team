## Moderator Logistics 

### 2-3 Days Before the Session 

- Review VA Platform’s [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-checklist#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions).
- Perigean will send you the sign in instructions for using Zoom accounts for user research. The first time you use their account you will need to coordinate with Perigean on 2FA. 

### Starting the Session 

- Sign out of personal Zoom. 
- Create thread in #feedback-backchannel. 
- Add observer instructions into the thread. 
- Connect earbuds. 
- Open up CodePen prototype in web browser. 
- Check that a11yInfoContainer is commented out in CodePen. 
- Open up the [Zoom guide](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/how-to-use-zoom-for-user-research) in a web browser. 
- Mute your Slack notifications. 
- After signing in to Zoom, you will be logged in as a presenter. Be sure to enter your name. 
- Check to see if recording is set to save in the cloud. 
- In the Participant “More” menu, make sure “Play Join and Leave Sound” is unchecked.
- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except for the participant is on mute.  
- In the Share menu, make sure all participants can share their screen. 
- Keep observers in the waiting room to ask the participant if they still consent to having observers in the session. Tell the observers to have their full name displayed and be ready to turn their cameras on for a brief introduction to the participant when they are admitted to the session.
