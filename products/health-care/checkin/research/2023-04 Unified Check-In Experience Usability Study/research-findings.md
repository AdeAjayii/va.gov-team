# Research Goals

The purpose of this generative research is to **get feedback from Veterans on the new “unified check-in” experience idea of enhancements to Patient Check In (PCI)** and, specifically, about ease of use and how well it meets expectations.

The new unified check-in experience hopes to address: 

- Veterans and staff don’t understand the difference between pre-check-in and check-in.
- Many Veterans use the pre-check-in link that was texted to them to initiate check-in on the day of their appointment, which does not actually allow them to check in.
- Some Veterans skip checking in altogether when they arrive at the clinic because they think they’re checked in as a result of completing the pre-check-in process, which in fact does not initiate or complete the online check in process.

*Note: “Unified check-in” isn’t a new product or product name. It’s simply an internal term being used to describe a set of features and visual changes to add into the Veteran-facing PCI product to improve ease of use for Veterans and increase utilization at VISNs.* 

## Research Questions

#### Primary Questions 

1. Do Veterans find the day before appointment reminder and pre-check-in notifications confusing?
2. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand that you still need to complete the online check-in process even if you’ve completed the pre-check-in process a few days before?
3. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to check in to an appointment?
4. Do Veterans think the check in confirmation page provides enough information about the status of their check in and what to do next?
5. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand if their other upcoming appointments have tasks to complete? For example, another appointment needs to complete pre-check-in or can initiate a check-in.
6. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand the difference between the pre-check-in process and checking in to an appointment?
7. Do Veterans find it helpful to be able to review all of their other upcoming appointments during the pre-check-in and check-in processes?
8. Would Veterans find it helpful to receive a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments with instructions on how to check in? 

#### Secondary Questions 

9. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to find the call to action from the appointment detail pages?
10. Do Veterans expect to find information about whether an appointment has already completed pre-check-in? If so, from the appointment list page or detail pages?

# Methodology 

- Conducted a moderated usability study using a CodePen (accessible) prototype with 13 Veterans who had been to a VA health facility for a medical appointment in the last 12 months 
- 12 out of 13 Veterans used their smartphones
- 60 minute sessions with non AT users, 90 minute sessions with AT users 
- Veterans were tasked with completing the pre-check-in and check in processes, while providing feedback of their thoughts and actions along the way

# Hypothesis and Conclusions

## Primary Questions 

1. Do Veterans find the day before appointment reminder and pre-check-in notifications confusing?
     - LIKELY FALSE: All Veterans found the notifications easy to understand, but some didn't feel the pre-check-in content was actionable enough. 
2. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand that you still need to complete the online check-in process even if you’ve completed the pre-check-in process a few days before?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: All Veterans said that it was very clear that you still need to check in even after completing pre-check-in because it's a known behavior for VA medical appointments. 
3. How easy or difficult is it to check in to an appointment?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: All Veterans thought the process for checking in to an appointment was easy.
4. Do Veterans think the check in confirmation page provides enough information about the status of their check in and what to do next?
     - DEFINITELY TRUE: All Veterans thought the information on the check in confirmation page was well organized and prioritized.
5. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand if their other upcoming appointments have tasks to complete? For example, another appointment needs to complete pre-check-in or can initiate a check-in.
     - LIKELY TRUE: All Veterans thought it was easy to understand and find out if their other upcoming appointments had tasks to complete from the confirmation pages and the appointments list. However, many Veterans didn't feel the content and design pattern on the confirmation pages was enough to incite action or, simply, had no interest in starting another task after their primary task was completed. 
6. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand the difference between the pre-check-in process and checking in to an appointment?
     - LIKELY TRUE: All Veterans understood the difference between the pre-check-in and check in process for VA medical appointments. However, it is difficult to simulate outside a real world scenario.
7. Do Veterans find it helpful to be able to review all of their other upcoming appointments during the pre-check-in and check-in processes?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans thought it was helpful to be able to review all of their upcoming appointments when completing pre-check-in or check-in. However, some Veterans had some concerns to make sure that it doesn't impose on the primary task that needs to be completed. 
8. Would Veterans find it helpful to receive a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments with instructions on how to check in?
     - LIKELY TRUE: All Veterans preferred receiving a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments compared to scanning a poster at the clinics. 

## Secondary Questions 

9. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to find the call to action from the appointment detail pages?
     - NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION
10. Do Veterans expect to find information about whether an appointment has already completed pre-check-in? If so, from the the appointment list page or detail pages?
     - LIKELY TRUE: Most Veterans expected to see which of their upcoming appointments have already completed pre-check-in, especially if they just completed that process for one of their other appointments when returning to the appointments list.

# Key Findings

**1. 12 out of 12 Veterans felt that the two pre-check-in text reminders were not confusing.** However, 5 out of 12 Veterans expected a better call to action in the second text message to encourage them to select the pre-check-in link. 

**2. 10 out of 10 Veterans thought it was easy or very easy to check in to an appointment.** I.e., the design and content cues from the appointment page to the confirmation page were easily findable and felt very guided. 

**3. 9 of out 9 Veterans said that nothing was confusing about the organization or prioritization of the check-in confirmation page.** Veterans thought the most important information on the page was that they were checked in successfully, their appointment details, and that their travel reimbursement claim was submitted.  

**4. Similar to how some Veterans find the check in status on the appointments list helpful, Veterans expected to find a similar appointment confirmation or “your information is up to date” status for pre-check-in on the appointments list.**

**5. 9 out of 11 Veterans thought that it was helpful to be able to review all of their upcoming appointments when completing a pre-check-in or check-in task.** However, not if it increases the ease of checking in or adds steps to the existing user flow. 

**6. 11 out of 11 Veterans thought it was easy to find out how to review their other upcoming appointments from the pre-check-in confirmation page.** However, some Veterans didn’t understand that they had other appointments with tasks to complete (based on the design pattern and content) or had no interest in starting another task after their primary task was completed. 

**7. 11 out of 11 Veterans prefer to receive a text message when it’s time to check in to their appointment.** And, 8 out of 11 Veterans would prefer to receive a text message before each of their appointments when they have more than one on the same day.
