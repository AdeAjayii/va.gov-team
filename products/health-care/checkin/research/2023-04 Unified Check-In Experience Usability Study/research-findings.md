# Research Goals

The purpose of this generative research is to **get feedback from Veterans on the new unified PCI experience idea** and, specifically, about ease of use and how well it meets expectations.

The new unified check-in experience hopes to address: 

- Veterans and staff don’t understand the difference between pre-check-in and check-in.
- Many Veterans use the pre-check-in link that was texted to them to initiate check-in on the day of their appointment, which does not actually allow them to check in.
- Some Veterans skip checking in altogether when they arrive at the clinic because they think they’re checked in as a result of completing the pre-check-in process, which in fact does not initiate or complete the online check in process. 

## Research Questions

#### Primary Questions 

1. Do Veterans find the day before appointment reminder and pre-check-in notifications confusing?
2. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand that you still need to complete the online check-in process even if you’ve completed the pre-check-in process a few days before?
3. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to check in to an appointment?
4. Do Veterans think the check in confirmation page provides enough information about the status of their check in and what to do next?
5. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand if their other upcoming appointments have tasks to complete? For example, another appointment needs to complete pre-check-in or can initiate a check-in.
6. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to understand the difference between the pre-check-in process and checking in to an appointment?
7. Do Veterans find it helpful to be able to review all of their other upcoming appointments during the pre-check-in and check-in processes?
8. Would Veterans find it helpful to receive a text message 45 minutes before each of their appointments with instructions on how to check in? 

#### Secondary Questions 

9. How easy or difficult is it for Veterans to find the call to action from the appointment detail pages?
10. Do Veterans expect to find information about whether an appointment has already completed pre-check-in? If so, from the appointment list page or detail pages?
