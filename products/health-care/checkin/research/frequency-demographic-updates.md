# Preliminary Desktop Research on Frequency of Demographic Review 

## Background & Goals
While we cannot make the decision on how often a veteran should be prompted to update his/her demographic information, we CAN provide a recommendation for best practice based on research. We need to determine the ideal frequency for programmatically determining when to ask the veteran for demographic updates.


### Research Question
- How often should Veterans be prompted to review their demographic information? What are the current industry standards?

### Use Case
As a veteran I only want to be asked to update my demographic information at certain intervals so that I don't have to go through it at every single appointment.

## Methodology
Conduct a landscape/competitive analysis of Cerner, Epic, and Phressia to understand current guidelines. 

## Initial Findings/Sources
