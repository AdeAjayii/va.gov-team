# Preliminary Desktop Research on Frequency of Demographic Review 

## Background & Goals
While we cannot make the decision on how often a veteran should be prompted to update his/her demographic information, we CAN provide a recommendation for best practice based on research. We need to determine the ideal frequency for programmatically determining when to ask the veteran for demographic updates.

Note: our current scope for veteran demographics are all the different addresses, email, phone numbers, next of kin, and emergency contact information.

### Research Question
- How often should Veterans be prompted to review their demographic information? What are the current industry standards?

### Use Case
As a veteran I only want to be asked to update my demographic information at certain intervals so that I don't have to go through it at every single appointment.

## Methodology
Conduct a landscape/competitive analysis of Cerner, Epic, and Phressia to understand current guidelines. 

## Initial Findings/Sources
Preliminary sources show that the current standard is to review patient demographic information at every encounter. This doesn't mean this practice leads to more accurate data necessarily, and some sources indicate it leads to increased patient frustrations. 

Cerner
- According to Lauren Alexanderson; VAs in Washington State requires updates at every patient encounter. "Spokane confirmed that they check demographics every time a veteran comes in"

Epic
- While Epic can be customized to prompt review demographic at any frequency, numerous healthcare systems have reported the most common frequency is at every encounter because it is critical information when identifying and addressing healthcare disparities https://www.epicshare.org/share-and-learn/laying-the-groundwork-to-identify-and-address-healthcare-disparities  

Phreesia Recommended Frequency
- According to Phressia, Zero-Contact intake removes some of the friction when asking patients to review common information. https://www.phreesia.com/coronavirus/zero-contact-intake/ 

VHA Directive 1604 
- Interpretation by Martinsburg, WV references this directive as the reason staff are required to review demographic information at every encounter. Corey Parker is following up for more detailed information as we've reviewed the directive at it wasn't evident. 
- Note: See Corey Parker for a copy of the Directive if needed. 

How often is too often to ask for data updates? 
- According to this article, patients resist providing demographic updates https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HfAV1DjVy4klBfbFNk6q--3TOdXhpTL7BmnlzWkGzW8/edit#gid=0
- "Some patients really resent being interviewed over and over, even if it turns out something really needed to be changed," Kraus adds. "But if you let it slide, you have incorrect billing, wrong insurance, returned mail."
"
- "At Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, NC, previously collected patient data are brought forward if they are less than 90 days old, but registrars still verify the information with the patient if he or she is available"

## Next Steps
Consider conducting additional research to better understand how often this basic demographic information changes for veterans. It could be that anything more than weekly, or monthly, would be unlikely to lead to additional changes to their information.
