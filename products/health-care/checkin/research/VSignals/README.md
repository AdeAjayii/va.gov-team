# Weekly Process for Analyzing VSignals Feedback

1. Kristen McConnell will copy the weekly comments into our aggregated spreadsheet, which is available on OneDrive.
    1. The spreadsheet is a query from all VSignals feedback containing the word check-in.
    2. If you need access to the OneDrive document and do not have it, message Kristen.
    3. Once the comments are copied, Kristen will message the check-in team member completing this week’s analysis.
3. The check-in team member completing analysis will review each comment.
    1.  First, they will categorize each comment using the drop down.
        1. If a new category is needed, it can be added to the “Tags” sheet, then it will automatically populate in the other sheet.
    2. If a summary or note is needed about a particular comment, then it can be added to the “Notes” column.
4. Create a quick summary report
    1. Look to this previous summary as a guide.
5. Post the summary on GitHub within this folder.
    1. File format: yyyy-mm-VSignals.md
6. Post a link to the GitHub summary on the #check-in-experience channel.
