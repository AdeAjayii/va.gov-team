# Biweekly Process for Analyzing VSignals Feedback

1. At the beginning of each sprint, Kristen McConnell will copy two weeks of comments into our aggregated spreadsheet, which is available on OneDrive.
    1. The VSignals reports that we receive are a query from all VSignals feedback containing the word check-in.
    2. If you need access to the OneDrive document and do not have it, message Kristen.
    3. Once the comments are copied, Kristen will message the check-in team member completing this week’s analysis.
2. The check-in team member completing analysis will open the Excel spreadsheet in the desktop app.
    1. Opening the spreadsheet in the desktop app will enable the multi-select dropdown tagging capability. The web app does not have this capability.
3. The check-in team member completing analysis will review each comment.
    1.  First, they will categorize each comment using the dropdown.
        1. **At least one category from the green list of tags must be selected for each comment.** Yellow tags are secondary options. View the "Tags" sheet to see which tags are green and yellow.
        2. If a new category is needed, it can be added to the “Tags” sheet. Once added, it will automatically populate in the synthesis sheet. Be sure to decide if the new category is meets the criteria for a green (primary category, where at least one must be selected) or yellow (secondary optional category) tag.
    2. If a summary or note is needed about a particular comment, then it can be added to the “Notes” column.
4. Create a quick summary report
    1. Look to [this previous summary as a guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/research/VSignals/2022-09-VSignals.md).
5. Post the summary on GitHub within this folder.
    1. File format: yyyy-mm-dd-VSignals.md
6. Post a link to the GitHub summary on the #check-in-experience channel.

*Kristen is still in the process of talking to Research Ops about adding these summaries to the research repo and the process that will involve.*
