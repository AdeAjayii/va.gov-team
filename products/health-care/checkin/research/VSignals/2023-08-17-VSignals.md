# August 17, 2023 VSignals Summary

Created: August 17, 2023

This is an analysis of Veteran feedback from **July 16, 2023 - August 6, 2023**.

Feedback from Veterans is captured in VSignals. This report queries VSignals for comments that mention "check in" and "travel reimbursement." In this date range, there were a total of [NUMBER] comments. 

Beginning in the previous iteration, we've been very intentional about how we scored the feedback. For example, when reading "The lady at the check-in counter was great!" we didn't score that as positive feedback as it was more feedback on the employee than the actual process. When reading "Check-in was really efficient and quick" we did score that as positive feedback as it was describing the process. This intentionality caused a sharp decline in both good and bad total comments, as you'll see in the graphs below. However, it helps highlight the times when the feedback only focuses on the process itself rather than on an employee.
