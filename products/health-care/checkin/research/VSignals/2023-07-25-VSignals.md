## Noteworthy Comments

> The new check in system seems very easy and streamlined for faster service, thank you.

> When I get automated calls about my appointments my birth date is wrong. This makes it impossible for me to pre check in. I asked about it at my appointment and was told to go to enrollment. I went there and was told I need my birth certificate.

> My experience at the VA overall good but for travel pay it should not be a separate form to fill out. As soon as you check in it should be one more check that is done by checking in. That would solve alot of the problems with this system that was intended to be a fix for what was not broken.

> Very happy that the check in machines are gone. They slowed things down and frequently broke. Just because technology is available, it doesn't always mean its better.

> By the way, the new check in process was an amazing experience!

> Your new check-in method is terrible. The phone screen is too small. To use my phone is extremely difficult as I have tremors.
