## Background 

The Patient Check In (PCI) product is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check in for a medical appointment. The Modernized Check-In Experience Team created the portion of the ecosystem that enables a Veteran to utilize their mobile device to “check in” through VA.gov. I.e., letting clinic staff know that the patient has arrived for their appointment. 

Check-in enables Veterans with appointments to: 

- Review and confirm their information prior to an appointment, also known as pre-check-in, which includes: 

     - Confirming their appointment
     - Reviewing their contact information 
     - Reviewing their emergency contact information
     - Reviewing their next of kin information 

- Utilize their smartphone to check-in on the day of their appointment
