### RICE Scoring
RICE Score = (R x I x C x D x B x M) / E

- R = Reach (#)
  - How many people will this impact? (Estimate within a defined time period.)
- I = Impact (0.25 - 3)
  - How much will this impact each person? (Massive = 3, High = 2, Medium = 1, Low = 0.5, Minimal = 0.25)
  - Does this increase the adoption of your product?    
- C = Confidence (%)
  - How confident are you in your estimates? (High = 100%, Medium = 80%, Low = 50%.)
  - To curb enthusiasm for exciting but ill-defined ideas, factor in your level of confidence about your estimates.     
- D - Disadvantaged Group
  - Does this help a disadvantaged group (No = 1, Yes = 2)
- B - Business Impact 
  - Impact to the VA overall (Massive = 3, High = 2, Medium = 1, Low = 0.5, Minimal = 0.25)
- M - Measurable
  - How easy can we measure the success? (No = 1, Yes = 2)
- E = Effort (#)
  - How many “person-months” will this take? (Use whole numbers and minimum of half a month)    
  - To move quickly and have impact with the least amount of effort, estimate the total amount of time a project will require from all members of your team
