# Initiative Brief Template
#### Overview

 
 *The following informaiton provided will cover the second iteration of the Check-in product since completion of the MVP, which is reimagining the ecosystem that allows a Veteran to check-in for a healthcare appointment. Specifically, based on uasability feedback from both Veterans and VA staffmembers, this iteration will incorporate the following features for the Check-in product:* 

- *the addition of using Last 4 of SSN and Last Name as identity verification data points.*
- *the ability for Veterans to view and check-in for multiple appointment in a single day.*
    - *showing a check-in status for each appointment.*
 
*Veterans wanted a more secure approach to validating idenitity rather than just a phone number that the Check-in MVP product uses. Veterans specifically called out using Last 4 of SSN and Last Name because these data points are commonly used when checking in. This was also confirmed from a staff facing perspective by observing these two data points being used for check-in when completed with a staff member.*

*The Check-in MVP only allows veterans to check in for an appointment if there is a single appointment for that day. Research has shown that many times Veterans may have multiple appointments in a single day so the appointments can all be completed at once. The iteration will enhance the experience for the Veeran by allowing them to use the Check-in Product for any and all appointments on a given day.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks.*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - .
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - .
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Cell service 
  - WiFi signal 
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - e.g. testing, marketing, compliance requirements

### Hypotheses & Prioritization
> *Describe the team's competing solution hypotheses/ideas. Prioritize them accounting for reach, impact/value, effort, and confidence.*

### Solution Scope
> *Addition of identity validations data points and multiple appointments are the two new key features in scope for this second iteration of the Check-in product. These were prioritized over other requests (such as travel reimbursement capabilities, idenitity card scanning, and other recommendations) due to the higher request rate from Veterans during usability testing.*
