# Initiative Brief - Enable eCheck-in for VA Facilities that use Oracle Health EHR Software

## Overview
 
## Outcome Summary
Veterans who have health appointments at VA facilities that use Oracle Health (formerly CERNER) EHR software will be able to use eCheck-in to let staff know that they have arrived.

## Problem

## Desired Outcomes

## Undesired Outcomes
