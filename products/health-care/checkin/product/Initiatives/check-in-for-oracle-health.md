# Initiative Brief - Enable eCheck-in for VA Facilities that use Oracle Health EHR Software

## Overview
 
## Outcome Summary
Veterans who have health appointments at VA facilities that use Oracle Health EHR software (formerly CERNER) will be able to use eCheck-in to verify their contact, emergency-contact, and next-of-kin information and let staff know that they have arrived.

## Problem
VA Facilities that use Oracle Health EHR software (instead of Vista) would like to offer Veterans the ability to use eCheck-in to verify their contact, emergency-contact, and next-of-kin information and let staff know that they have arrived for their appointment. 

## Desired Outcomes
- VA facilities that use Oracle Health EHR software can offer eCheck-in for Veterans to verify their contact, emergency-contact, and next-of-kin information and let staff know that they have arrived

## Undesired Outcomes
- VA facilities that use Oracle Health EHR software have no way for Veterans to let staff know that they have arrived

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
