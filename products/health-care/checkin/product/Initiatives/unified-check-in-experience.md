# Initiative Brief - Unified Check-in Experience

## Overview
 
## Outcome Summary
Veterans will have a better understanding of the tasks they need to complete for a health appointment.

## Problem
The Modernized Check-In Experience Team has received feedback from Veterans and staff that PCI is too complicated. Specifically, the feedback includes:
- Veterans and staff don’t understand the difference between pre-check-in and check-in.
- Many Veterans use the pre-check-in link that was texted to them to initiate check-in on the day of their appointment, which does not actually allow them to check in.
- Some Veterans skip checking in altogether when they arrive at the clinic because they think they’re checked in as a result of completing the pre-check-in process, which in fact does not initiate or complete the online check in process. 

## Desired User Outcomes
- Veterans have a better understanding of the pre-check-in and check-in tasks
- Veterans are able to complete their task(s) regardless of what link they use

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans are most confused by pre-check-in and check-in
- Veterans are more frustrated with the pre-check-in and check-in process

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Increased usage of pre-check-in and check-in

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Decreased usage of pre-check-in and check-in

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Favorable VSignals feedback from Veterans who use Pre-Check-in and eCheck-in
- Increase in the use of Pre-Check-in and Check-in

	      - Clicked on "Review your info" & answered No to at least 1 question
          - New link to get back to the new landing page (minus the message of other tasks to do)

- Phase 5
    - Ability to complete a task for an appointment NOT associated with the link clicked
        - NOTE: we will need to ensure that status's are set properly so that the Veteran does not receive more pre-check-in reminders & VSECS is updated as well

- Phase 7
    - Changes to Need Help
- Phase 8
    - Allow Veterans to access Pre-Check-in & Check-in regardless if the link has expired or they have no appointments for today (can we re-generate the LoROTA entry for some limited time period? does this affect the ATO?)
