# Healthcare Experience - CheckIn MVP


## Overview
This product and mobile app which will be developed by a different team allows the Veteran to check in using a mobile device on va.gov or via text for their VA medical appointment. 

## Problem Statement
Currently VA medical facilities have a kiosk that are utilized by the Veterans to check fo medical appointments when they arrive. These Kiosks are being sun-setted in CY 2022. The purpose of this product is to: 

 1. Replace the functionality of the Kiosk 
 2. Put in place infrastructure for an end-to end solution for Veteran digital experience with VA health services, as this is a POC for consolidating data from disparate systems into a seamless solution 

 
## Desired User Outcomes

 - Easy to use check-in UX that Veterans want to use instead of face-to-face check-in
 - EZ and fast authentication to check-in for medical appointments

## Undesired User Outcomes

 - An experience that is inferior or harder to use then  the current physical Kiosks 
 - Increase in face-to-face interactions

## Desired Business Outcomes

 - Ability to eliminate physical Kiosks resulting in savings for the VA
 - Setting foundation for unified digital  healthcare experience 

## Undesired Business Outcomes

 - Increased face to face interactions

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

 While this MVP will be a pilot, the long term KPIs will be: 

 - Percentage of Veterans who chose digital check-in vs. face-to-face interaction
 - Time to check in vs. Physical kiosks

#### Baseline KPI Values
* Pending 

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

 - Number of Veterans who use digital check-in vs. face to face in Pilot

## Assumptions

All data will be available via Vets API integration. Data work is being done by a different team that will aggregate all the disparate systems into a micro services layer integrated into Vets API. 

## Solution Approach

**MVP**
The MV will focus on check product only. Future iterations will include day of and post visit functionality

**Potential Future Iterations**
Will focus on day of and post visit functionality

## Go-to-market Strategy
A Pilot site will be chosen, following the Clipboard methodology. Once the site is chosen that group of Veterans will be a pilot group where the Kiosk will be replaced with digital check-in.

## Solution Narrative

A Veteran will receive a text and email linking them to an easy to use check-in UI. A Veteran can also chose to text - I am here using their mobile device. Once that is done, the VA medical facility will be notified (via existing backend systems) that teh Veteran has checked in 

### Current Status

Veteran research and onsite Kiosk  Research has been completed.
