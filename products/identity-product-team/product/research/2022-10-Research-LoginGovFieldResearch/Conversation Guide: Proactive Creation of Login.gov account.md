## Intro - 5 minutes
 
Thank you for making time to meet with us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. [Ask notetaker to give a brief introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)]. For most of the time we are together you and I will be talking and [NOTETAKER NAME] will be taking notes, but I’ll pause ever so often and he/she/they might jump in with a question or two. 
Today we're going to explore some options related to how you log in to access VA Services like MyHeatheVet.
 
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
 
- **This entire session should take about 2 hours.** I want to be sure to respect your time, so you may see me check the time periodically and  I may occasionally need to move us along to the next section of our conversation.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you or your ability. If something is confusing or difficult for you it means it will be for other people as well and we need to fix it. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Over the course of our session I’ll be asking you to imagine yourself in certain scenarios and may show you pictures to set the stage for those scenarios. I will also show you some mock-ups or prototypes** This is a simulation to allow us to understand how to improve certain processes. Some areas of the scenario or process may not be fully fleshed out. Since this is just a simulation, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or login.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record our conversation as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 
 
*Start recording.*
 
- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record our session as we talk today? 
 
## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 10 minutes
 
To start I’d love to learn a little more about you. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself and how you interact with the VA?
- What has your experience been like in transition back to civilian life? 
- Have you gotten your VHIC? What was that process like? When was  that?

[Do we need to screen for veterans who are eligible for care at VAMC?]
 
## SCENARIO 1: LOGIN.GOV SET-UP DURING VHIC PROCESS - 45 minutes
 Thank you for that information. Now I’d like to dive into sharing some concepts that we are exploring. As I mentioned before these are just ideas and we are eager for your honest feedback so we can learn what works, what needs improvement and what to scrap all together. 
## First Task: [VHIC Admin asks about Login.gov account] - 10 minutes
[Connect to veteran’s context as appropriate] So, I want you to imagine that you want to start seeing a doctor at the VAMC and so the first part of the process is to get a Veteran Health Information Card. You gather up the necessary information and go to the eligibility office at your local VA medical center. As you are finishing the process of applying for your card the person who has been helping you says, “While we are finalizing your VHIC application I can also help get you set up with a login.gov account. Login.gov is a secure way to access many different government services from Social Security to TSA. But specifically, the VA uses it so you can access a service called MyHealtheVet. MyHealtheVet is a health record portal that allows you to view your healthcare records, securely communicate with your VA doctors and refill your prescriptions online. Setting up login.gov will add about 5 minutes to this process. Are you interested in doing that now?”
- Would you be interested in getting a login.gov account? Why? Why not?
- Would you choose to get set up for a login.gov account while doing your VHIC application? Why or why not?
- Any other thoughts about this section?

### Things to watch for:
- Understanding of what login.gov is/does
- Would participants like to know they are going to have this choice ahead of time?

## Second Task: [IN-PERSON ACCOUNT SET-UP: INFO GATHERING/REVIEW] - 5 minutes
Imagine you decide to 
- Was there any information I asked for that you would not be able to provide in the moment (if the participant already mentioned some information they don’t have, repeat it here)?
- Was there any information I asked for that you don’t have at all?
- Was there any information I asked for that you wouldn’t be comfortable answering?
- If the VA had kiosks available so you could enter your own information and ask an employee if you had questions would you prefer that to having me ask you for all of your information?  Why or why not?
### Things to watch for:
- Frustration about having to supply information again
- Discomfort about sharing information

## Third Task: [IN-PERSON ACCOUNT SET-UP: ID PROOFING/REVIEW] - 5 minutes
### Things to watch for:

## Fourth Task:  [IN-PERSON ACCOUNT SET-UP: MFA] - 10 minutes
Alright, the last step for creating your login.gov account is to set-up an additional security check in addition to entering your username and password. We call this Multi-factor Authentication. You can do this additional security check a number of different ways. You can have a code texted to you or emailed to you that would then type in after you enter your username and password, or you can download an app that will generate the code that you enter in, or you can use a security key or you can have the code mailed to you using the post office, so it involved a delay.
- Do you already use multi-factor authentication for anything else in your life? Maybe for accessing your bank info or email accounts? 
- (If yes) How does that work for you? What kind of MFA do you use? Is anyone else involved in helping you do that?
- Which option do you think you’d choose for login.gov? Why?
- If you had the option to opt out of using MFA by acknowledging that not using MFA makes your personal medical information including medical records and prescription shipment information more vulnerable, would you? Why/why not? 
- One option we are exploring is slow or by mail MFA. The way that would work would be when you need access to MHV you request a code and we mail it to you. In 3-5 days when the code arrives you can use it along with your username and password to login and message your doctor or refill your prescriptions.
What do you think about that option? 

### Things to watch for:

 ## Fifth Task: [IN-PERSON ACCOUNT SET-UP: LOGIN TO MHV WITH NEW CREDENTIALS & SET UP CAREGIVER OPTIONS] - 5 minutes
[Need to write transition to using MHV]
Congratulations, your login.gov account has been completed and you can now use it to log into MHV as well as for many other government websites. You just type your new username and password in here.
Show existing screen/flow for using login.gov to access MHV
Now that you are logged with your new credentials you have the option to set-up limited or full access to your account for anyone who you want. That person will be able to create their own account and with their own username and password and access as much of your information as you want them to have access to. And you can change or remove their access at any time.
- Is that something you would like to do?
- Who would you like to give access to? What kind of information would you like to give them access to? Why?
- Anyone else?
- Is there anyone you would share your username and password with? Why?
- Would you consider giving that person full access but asking them to create their own account? Why/why note?
### Things to watch for:
- Is this feature useful to them. 
- What type of information would they share


[IN-PERSON ACCOUNT SET-UP: WHAT TO EXPECT/NEXT STEPS]
### Things to watch for:

## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
Thank you so much for walking through all of that with me.
- Of all of the things we reviewed, is there something that you think is especially important for us to make sure to implement?
- Of all of the things we reviewed, is there something that you really didn’t like and we should make sure not implement?
- If you were going to tell a fellow veteran about upgrading their MHV account to use login.gov for access, what would you say?
- Any other thoughts you want to share about what we reviewed together? 
- Any questions for me? 
 
## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
 
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on Veterans options for accessing their benefits.  

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
 
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
 
## Emergency Exit
[Will be updated based on specifics of our physical location.]
[For an emergency with our team] Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback. [Note that any compensation from Perigean will still arrive as discussed.]
[For building-wide issue like fire alarm] Well, it looks like we need to cut our conversation short. Can we help you find the exit?
