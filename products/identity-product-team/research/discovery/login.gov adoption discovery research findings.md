## Research Goals
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access My HealtheVet and other VA services. These login options don’t all meet the required security standards and also create frustration and confusion for users.

Through our research, we hoped to explore how the VA can most successfully migrate existing users, and onboard new user to Login.gov (which is a compliant, single sign-on credentialing platform). While Login.gov does currently exist, our research hopes to uncover the best ways to support Veterans, non-Veteran roles, and VA staff in this transition.

### How this research maps to the Veteran journey
1. Attending to health needs: How can we proactively intervene at this stage to make sure Veterans are able to create a Login.gov account they will use to access My HealtheVet going forward?
2. Managing my declining health: How can we help Veterans who are aging and managing their declining health have clear and technically-feasible options to transition their access to My HealtheVet to Login.gov and ID.me?

### Goals
1. Understand how we can intervene to ensure that new generations of Veterans use Login.gov or ID.me to access My HealtheVet from the start.
2. Understand what in-person support will enable Veterans to create and use a Login.gov account to access My HealtheVet.
3. Understand how the greatest number of Veterans can use multi-factor authentication options, including security keys.
4. Understand how setting up and maintaining shared access might work for Veterans and non-Veterans.

## Research Questions

* When should proactive intervention encourage the creation of a Login.gov account?
* What do Veterans find important or beneficial when choosing a login credential?
* How do we communicate the need to migrate to Login.gov to access services?
* How do we support Veterans and non-Veterans after they set up Login.gov?
* When people in-person proof and migrate their account, what issues arise for them?
* What resources or workflows will help with issues during in-person proofing & migration?
* How do Veterans understand the process of choosing and using a MFA method?
* Which MFA options will allow more Veterans to migrate to Login.gov?
* How can MFA support non-Veterans who need access to parts of a Veterans’ information?
* Which non-Veteran users would Veterans choose to set up access for, when and why?
* How do non-Veterans imagine shared access to work for themselves and non-Veterans?

## Methodology 

1. Scenario Validation: We presented Veterans with a scenario showing a potential approach to creating a Login.gov account and accessing My HealtheVet. This helped us evaluate whether Veteran finds a particular solution is useful, clear, appropriate or concerning.

2. Service Prototype Testing: We used this method alongside scenarios, walking Veterans through a service prototype of how they would in-person proof, set up multi-factor authentication and secure a Login.gova account at a VA facility. This helped us evaluate the workflow and support needed.

3. Intercepts: We ran contextual intercepts with Veterans where we shared various stimuli, like, an email or a login screen. This helped us clarifying content and tone-of-voice of messaging, in particular, and reach Veterans who don’t yet have a My HealtheVet or Login.gov account.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions [WIP]

When should proactive intervention encourage the creation of a Login.gov account?
- Veterans go through extensive proofing when they apply for healthcare and get their VHIC.
- When Veterans get their photo for VHIC they should proactively set up their Login.gov accounts.
- Many Veterans choose to use in-person proofing to upgrade their MHV account to premium.
- Offering an in-person proofing option will increase the adoption of Login.gov for those who aren't able to set it up themselves online.
- Combining with an appointment reminder will make it convenient for Veterans.

What do Veterans find important or beneficial when choosing a login credential?
- We should communicate that Login.gov is a portal, not a destination.
- A metaphor, like master key, will enable comprehension.
- Messaging around safety and security will encourage adoption.
- Veteran's need to be reassured that there will be no gap in their ability to access MHV.

How do we communicate the need to migrate to Login.gov to access services?
- Messaging around safety and security will encourage adoption.
- Adding a deadline will set expectation that setting up login.gov is not optional (deferred).
- Combining with an appointment reminder will make it convenient for Veterans.
- Access to services outside of the VA will be another selling point.

How do we support Veterans and non-Veterans after they set up Login.gov?
- First few steps in the login flow are confusing (particularly being redirected back to VA.gov).
- People need support in-person.

When people in-person proof and migrate their account, what issues arise for them?
- Only part of the process needs to be in-person.
- ID verification as an in-person option will decrease login.gov abandonment.
- Veterans will be open to other trusted VA roles who can verify (e.g., nurse at doc appt).

What resources or workflows will help with issues during in-person proofing & migration?
- Need to add

How do Veterans understand the process of choosing and using a MFA method?
- For compliant identity proofing, MFA is required.
- "MFA" may be unfamiliar, but messaging it will help reinforce security.
- Veterans are unfamiliar with MFA and the process.
- Frustration or struggle to use MFA, leads to aversion of using VA digital services & MHV.

Which MFA options will allow more Veterans to migrate to Login.gov?
- Current MFA options present challenges to Veterans with technology issues or disabilities.
- Security keys might be easier for Veterans to use.
- Security keys can be useful for homeless Veterans, to access services at a library, for example.
- People are encouraged to set up more than one option, and a security key could be a backup option.

How can MFA support non-Veterans who need access to parts of a Veterans’ information?
- Security keys will provide benefits for managing caregiver access security.
- Because the person being cared for can see that their caretaker is using the security key.

Which non-Veteran users would Veterans choose to set up access for, when and why?
- Need to add

How do non-Veterans imagine shared access to work for themselves and non-Veterans?
- Need to add
