# Find a VA Form Executive Summary May 2021
## Current State of the Product
- X total forms
- X forms with detail pages
- Average of X forms added per week
- Out of those, we publish and average of X detail pages

## Search Improvements
- We're iteratively improving search - we have solved one of the biggest pain points, which is the format of the form number.  In solving that, we've solved probably X? of the search issues [what is that number?]
- Now we're working on ranking/matching
- We tried this….

## De-couple from Lighthouse
- We looked at it at and determined it was not the right solution because…
- Not now because it would involve CMS effort, and they don't have bandwidth
- Timing - searching solution is better in Lighthouse 
- Lighthouse can handle the load better and we can handle a more sophisticated search
    - Note from Nichole - No I did not reach out to Tina Skelly, thought maybe we could do that together since a decision really should be made for both the API external consumers and for the VA forms search (maybe the same decision).
Vet Pro is an application built by Panoramic Software, which is used by VSOs and Veterans to submit benefit claims. It includes a form search page which uses the LH forms API similarly to how the VA.gov search page does except that it is a little more integrated as a next step with submitting the forms for benefit claims immediately after. 

## Find a Form POC
- Brian McCarthy's gone
- Janel had little knowledge of the POC when we spoke with her
- We agreed to re-visit in the fall - Janel doesn't currently have bandwidth; Josh is taking extended OOO
- CMS doesn't have bandwidth; they are focused on other projects
- What would be the goals of the POC
    - Content rigidity/data hygiene
    - Put the content back in the hands of the content manager
     - Extend beyond VHA, adding NCA (National Cemetery Admin), others into the mix
