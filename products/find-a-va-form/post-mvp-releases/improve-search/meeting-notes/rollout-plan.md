## Notes

- Zach and Mark discussed doing a feature flag
- It's ready as soon as Zach can implement a feature flag
- When might Zach be able to implement a Feature Flag?  As soon as the API pull request is merged and he sees the key.
- We should be able to see it on Staging maybe Monday. 
- Mark should have it squashed and merged on Monday
- Mark has found that the results are really good
- When this goes to Production we will probably want to default to this 
- Feasibly could do this a week from next Monday.  
- Mark - would we want to have Kaycee (at the VA) test?  They've build a relationship with her, has the most knowledge, very passionate about her job, and would probably like to be involved.
- Mark and Nichole will reach out to Kaycee 
- We should also get a couple of Veterans on our staff to test (Brian)
