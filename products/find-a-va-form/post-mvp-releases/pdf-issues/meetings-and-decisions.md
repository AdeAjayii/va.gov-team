# Meetings and Attendees

## 2021-05-13 PDF Issues Meeting with Ming

### Attendees
- Ming Ligh
- John Hashitmoto
- Marci McGuire

### Notes
- Can we provide more details in our guidance document?
- Marci is reluctant to give blanket guidance not being a PDF expert, and the OIT probably also has a say.
- Ming's take is that we are more experts on PDFs than they are
- Is Acroforms more how forms were created by the VHA office?   Yes
- All the new formats and functionality is screwing things up in development
- This is going to take a little more research to determine works for all the use cases
- We potentially need to talk to Fran and her team to make sure they understand what we put out there last week.
