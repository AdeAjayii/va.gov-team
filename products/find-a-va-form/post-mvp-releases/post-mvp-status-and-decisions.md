# Post-MVP Status and Decisions


### 9/8/2021 Marci McGuire
The PDF user research study revealed that almost every test user overlooked three PDF download/Adobe Reader information, regardless of where it was positioned (top of page or next to each PDF link) or how it was styled. The recommendation from the study was to use a modal that would have to be viewed.  After discussing the research findings with Ryan Thurwell (DEPO Design Lead) and Angela Fowler (Accessibility Specialist), we all agreed this was a good use case for a modal.  The modal would be invoked when attempting to download a PDF.  It would provide brief info about downloading & using Adobe Reader, a link to download Adobe Reader, a link to a Resources & Support page about PDFs, and a link to the PDF form itself.

The PDF user research study uncovered a wide variety of previously-observed and completely unexpected challenges with users downloading, saving, and opening PDF forms on various operating systems and browsers.  Because we only tested four forms (less than 1%) during the hour-long sessions, John Hashimoto and Marci McGuire agreed it made sense to audit all of the forms available via Find a VA Form to determine how many exhibit the issues observed during user testing.  Upon taking over as Product Owner, Dave Conlon agreed having a sense of how many forms were impacted, as well as how often they were downloaded, would be useful to the VA.

   - A high-level overview of the audit findings are located on the first tab.  
   - The second tab contains all the elements evaluated and the findings.
   - The third tab gives a brief history of PDF for context to show how far behind the current version some of the forms are.
   - Below is a graph showing the most significant findings.

### 6/1/2021 Marci McGuire
After receiving several anectodal reports and experiencing first-hand issues with some PDF forms, John Hashimoto and Marci McGuire agreed it made sense to do a new user research session in which we would ask users to open several different PDF forms.  This session would not only allow us to confirm that users are experiencing issues, but also support exploring other options for electronic forms.

In conjunction with the Accessibility, IA and Content teams, we made a decision to temporarily archive form detail pages for Spanish language forms in the CMS as there is currently no template for creating detail pages in Spanish.  As a result, detail pages for Spanish forms contain a mix of Spanish text derived from the CMS custom metadata and English from the detail page template in the CMS. A [backlog ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/25008) was created to create a Spanish page template with assistance from the Globalization team. Redirects were also created to point all of the URLs back to the Find a VA Form search landing page.  Forms impacted:

### 1/23/2021 Marci McGuire
The post-MVP enhancements to link the Find a VA Form search page to form details pages and online tools was launched on 1/21/2021 and included the ability to sort forms by date.

### 1/05/2021 Marci McGuire
The decision was made to exclude the ability to sort forms by date in the post-MVP launch.  That will come in late Jan/early Feb.

### 12/31/2020 Marci McGuire
We tentatively plan to launch Post-MVP enhancements on Jan 12, 2021, which will provide direct links from search results to form details page (where they exist) and the ability to sort results by **Form last updated** date.

### 2020/12/21 Marci McGuire
John Hashimoto and Marci McGuire agreed that the features being implemented were low-risk and don't warrant conducting user research.
