Post MVP Status and Decisions


## 04/07/2021

In conjunction with the Accessibility, IA and Content teams, we made a decision to temporarily archive form detail pages for Spanish language forms in the CMS as there is currently no template for creating detail pages in Spanish.  As a result, detail pages for Spanish forms contain a mix of Spanish text derived from the CMS custom metadata and English from the detail page template in the CMS. A [backlog ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/25008) was created to create a Spanish page template with assistance from the Globalization team. Redirects were also created to point all of the URLs back to the Find a VA Form search landing page.  Forms impacted:
