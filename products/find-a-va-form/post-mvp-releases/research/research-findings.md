# Research Goals
The purpose of this research was to 
1. Better understand how Veterans download VA PDF forms and what challenges they encounter.
1. Get feedback on designs for advising users to download a PDF form and then open it with Acrobat, instead of viewing it in a web browser. We wanted to assess the performance of three different design options for providing instructions.


# Research Questions

- How intuitive is the download process with the new instructions? What issues arise (with the interace and/or specific forms)?
  - Do users click on the new instructions link?
  - Do users have difficulty navigating back to the Find a Form page from the instructions?
  - Do users download the form?
  - Do some users not notice the download notification/file at the bottom of the browser window?
  - Are there any difficulties in finding the file to open it? 
  - Does the file always open in Acrobat?
  - What are users' reactions to auto-download? 
- Are participants able to save and/or digitally sign the forms? 
- Do different download behaviors from different forms (e.g., auto-downloading ones vs. not) cause issues for users?
- What is the success rate of participants downloading forms from each of the two design options? Is one more effective than the other? 

# Methodology 

We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on **July 27-30, 2021**. Participants were asked to search for the following four PDF forms using the Find a Form page on Staging (https://staging.va.gov/find-forms/):
1. 10-2850c (most downloaded, has digital signature)
1. 10-0003k (has digital signature)
1. 20-0968 (not hosted on VA.gov)
1. 20-0995 (one of most downloaded, can fill out in browser, hosted inside VA.gov)

Each participant saw one of three versions of the Find a Form page:
- Instructions at the top of the list of forms 
- Instructions repeated above every form download link in a light blue box
- Instructions repeated directly above every form download link in gray help text

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. The new instructions will enable people of diverse technical abilities, ages, and disabilities to download and open PDF forms in Acrobat. 
    1. LIKELY TRUE: 
1. The new instructions will enable people of diverse technical abilities, ages, and disabilities to save and digitally sign PDF forms. 
1. The new instructions will alleviate issues with forms that have different download behaviors.
1. Instructions at the top of the list of forms will be missed when they scroll off the screen.
1. Instructions repeated above every form download link will get ignored or be annoying, especially to users of screen readers. 

_(“True”, “Likely True” or “Definitely True”) Why?_
“False”
“Don’t know”
“Not enough information”


# Mapping to the Veteran journey

_How does this research map to the Veteran journey? Explain what a Veteran might do before and after using this tool. What moments does this tool live in? Are there moments that matter to keep in mind? What are Veteran’s familiarity with tools like this? (do they use tools like this, or is this something new)._

# Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._
