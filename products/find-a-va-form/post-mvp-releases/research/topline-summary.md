This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Participants
We talked to **11** participants (all Veterans except for one family member of a Veteran). 4 participants used screen readers during the sessions.

Participants were on a variety of devices:
- 9 on a desktop/laptop computer
- 2 on a tablet
- 1 on a smartphone

## Findings
We had intended to assess participants' success in downloading PDF forms per each of the 3 designs we had for providing instructions, but unfortunately we found that *most people completely ignored the instructions*--no matter which design they saw. 

More disappointing was the finding that *most participants (9 of 11) were unable to complete any of the user tasks without a lot of help* from the moderator and notetakers, and many participants were unable to succeed even with the help provided. Only 2 participants were able to download and fill out any of the forms without help, and neither was successful with all of the forms. 

Unique issues were encountered in every session, which will be documented in the full report. A few are mentioned below in this summary. Some of the issues were specifically accessibility-related and affected only screen reader users, while other issues affected participants universally regardless of their visual ability/disability.
