# Research Plan: Find a Form PDF Downloading
 	
## Goals	
The purpose of this research is to better understand how Veterans download VA forms and get feedback on our designs for advising users to download a PDF and then open it with Acrobat instead of viewing it in a web browser.

## Background
Modern browsers enable PDFs to be viewed directly instead of needing to first be downloaded. Many VA forms are in PDF format and need to be filled out in Acrobat in order to save the information entered and use a digital signature. Our challenge is how to advise users to download the forms to their device and then open them in Acrobat, when the details of how to do that vary by the specific form and the user's operating system, browser, settings by file type, and whether they have Acrobat Reader installed.

## Research questions
- How intuitive is the download process? What issues arise?
  - Do some users not notice the download notification/file at the bottom of the browser window?
  - Are there any difficulties in finding the file to open it? 
  - Does the file always open in Acrobat?
  - What are users' reactions to auto-download? (if testing this) 
- What types of cases are there?
  - Form downloads when you click the link
  - Form opens in browser when you click the link
  - Downloaded form won't open when you click on it

## Hypotheses
- TBD 	

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants will be asked some interview questions about their past usage of VA forms, and then will be given some tasks involving forms to download.

*Will there be a design prototype? Will there be a POC on DocuSign?*
