## Research Methodology 

We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on **July 27 - 30, 2021**. Participants were asked about...

### Differences by Participant Categories
- **Mobile vs. desktop**: There were *no major differences in research results between mobile and desktop users*, as users on both kinds of devices spent much of their time on the "top 4" boxes. The big difference between mobile and desktop is the interaction required to reach other links: mobile users have to tap the "Menu" button in the header before they can see the *VA Benefits and Health Care* megamenu and *Find a VA Location*. Of the 5 mobile users in this research, 3 used the Menu button and seemed comfortable doing so. The other 2 mobile users did not use the "Menu" button during the research sessions, and it is unknown whether they noticed it or not. The footer on mobile has accordians to access *VA Forms, Resources and support,* and *Find a VA Location* links, but none of the mobile research participants scrolled down to the footer to see this. 
- **Cognitive disability**: 3 participants were reported to have a cognitive disability, but this was not confirmed during the research sessions. *No significant differences* in task performance were observed between these individuals and the others, although one of them was among the four participants overall who had difficulty typing concise search queries and correctly spelling the words in them. A different participant with a cognitive disability finished fewer tasks than many other participants, but that was likely due to their tendency to talk in detail about their experiences with the VA and focus less on completing the research tasks. Note that these 3 participants are unlikely to represent a full spectrum of cognitive disabilities, including major reading or problem-solving disabilities or attention disabilities in a natural environment with more distractions (see more information about the [diversity of cognitive disabilities](https://webaim.org/articles/cognitive/)).
- **Screen reader**: The one participant who used a screen reader completed fewer tasks than many other participants because *listening to their screen reader read text aloud resulted in slower navigation*. 
- **Hadn't used VA.gov before**: Only 2 participants had never used VA.gov before, and there were *no notable differences* in their interactions with the website when compared to the other participants.
