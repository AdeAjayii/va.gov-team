* How are we going to find out answers? (There are tons of different methods to choose from depending on your project goals, resources, and time constraints. Checkout the methods and templates provided in the [Discovery Toolkit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) and consult the [Research Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/research).)
