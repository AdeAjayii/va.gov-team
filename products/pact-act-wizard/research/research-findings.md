## Research Goals
The PACT Act Wizard is an i**nteractive question-and-answer flow to help Veterans understand how the PACT Act may apply to them**. 

There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Attending to health needs)
- Taking care of myself (Recognizing and addressing mental health needs, Managing primary care and chronic health issues, Seeking support for an acute health event, Maintaining my health)
- Retiring (Taking care of my health)
- Aging (Managing my declining health)

The purpose of this research is to **get feedback on the content** in the PACT Act Wizard by finding out whether we’ve met these goals: 

- The **questions drafted for the PACT Act Wizard are clear and easy** enough for Veterans (or family members seeking information on behalf of a Veteran) to understand and confidently answer. 

- Veterans (or family members seeking information on behalf of a Veteran) can **understand from the results if they might be eligible** for disability or health care based on the PACT Act. 

- Veterans (or family members seeking information on behalf of a Veteran) can **understand from the results how to apply for benefits** related to the PACT Act based on their situation. 

Learnings will help refine questions and the presentation of results in the wizard.

## Research Questions
1. What feedback do Veterans (and others) have on **individual questions**? 
1. What feedback do Veterans (and others) have on the **entire set of questions**?
    - Total number of questions 
    - Similar structure of the questions

1. Do Veterans (and others) **know enough about their military service to answer the questions**? If not, what do they need to answer them?

1. What feedback do Veterans (and others) have on the **results**?
     - Date/range
     - "Presumptive conditions"
     - Next steps
     

1. If the tool says that they're eligible, what do they say they would **do next**?

## Methodology 
We conducted **remote usability testing** over Zoom on October 2-6, 2023 to get feedback from research participants using a prototype that presents the questions and results screens in the PACT Act Wizard. The prototype was not a high-fidelity design prototype but instead an **online survey (in Survey Monkey) that presented questions** and branches appropriately to subsequent questions and relevant results screens. In this way, we **tested the *content* of the PACT Act Wizard**—the text and flow of the questions and the logical branching—but *not* the UI design. 

Perigean recruited the participants.

**We talked to 9 Veterans**, one of whom was also a Veteran's family member (spouse).
-  *Most (8 of 9) had NOT applied for VA benefits under the PACT Act*. The one who did had applied just the week before.
- 4 served in *1989 or earlier*, 2 served in *1990 or later*, and 3 served *during both* periods of time.
- *Most (8 of 9) used a computer* during the session; only 1 used a smartphone.


For more details, see [Who we talked to](#who-we-talked-to).

Participants were asked about the following:
1. Wayfinding--Find out if you're eligible for VA health care with your current income, with no guidance for where to start
2. The landing page in the prototype, which you can use to get to the income limits app (Note: The landing page is a screenshot of the [Your health care costs page](https://www.va.gov/health-care/about-va-health-benefits/cost-of-care/) page on VA.gov)
3. The intro page in the app
4. The question pages in the app
5. The results page in the app
6. What they would do next after seeing the results
7. How to check whether they entered their location correctly
8. How to see the income limits for a previous year


## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. Veterans (and others) will find the questions to be clear and easy to understand and answer.
2. Veterans (and others) will find the number and content of the questions to be relevant to their understanding of the PACT Act and how it applies to them (or the Veteran). 

1. Veterans (and others) won't find the number and content of the questions to be overly burdensome. 

1. The results are simple enough for Veterans (and others) to understand and are not misleading. 

1. Veterans (and others) will understand what "presumptive conditions" mean after reading the plain language description in the results flow. 

    
     1. LIKELY TRUE: Participants...
     1. MAYBE TRUE: Participants...


## Key Findings

1. All participants understood 


## Details of Findings 

### 1. All participants understood...

### Usability Successes
1. **Most participants were able to answer most of the wizard questions easily.**
1. **No comments about too many questions**. Participants were presented with anywhere from 2-10 questions, which varied based on their responses and the branching logic.
1. All participants **understood *presumptive conditions***, but not from the PACT Act Wizard. Most said that they already knew from talking to other Veterans or looking into the PACT Act already.
1. Participants generally **understood the results screens** and figured out what  they should do next.

### Usability Issues
5. Three participants had **difficulty answering the service years question** because they found the options confusing.
1. Two participants brought up (unprompted) that they **didn't know what a "C-123 plane" was**, which was mentioned in one of the Agent Orange questions. Two other participants said, *"If it applied to you, you would know" (p9).*
1. Some participants had **beliefs about whether they were eligible for benefits under the PACT Act** before trying the PACT Act Wizard, and some of these beliefs were *incorrect* and not addressed by any content in the wizard.
1. Three participants were **confused by the jump links** at the top of the results page on Staging because they interpreted them as CTA's (i.e., *file a disability claim* or *apply for health care* right now).
