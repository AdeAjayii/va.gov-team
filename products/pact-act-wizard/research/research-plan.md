# Research Plan for Usability Testing, PACT Act Wizard, September 2023

## Background
The [PACT Act of 2022](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3967/text) is intended to significantly improve healthcare access and funding for Veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during military service. The law itself is not easy for a Veteran to read and understand whether or not it directly affects them and their benefits. To provide an easier way for a Veteran or Veteran's representative (family member, caregiver, other) to understand whether the PACT Act may apply to them, we are designing a PACT Act Wizard.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research aligns with the following [OCTO Objectives]([url](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme)).

North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
1. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Goals:

1. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
1. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Percent of applications submitted online (if Veterans move from this tool to online application)
- Benefit use and enrollment
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Attending to health needs)
- Taking care of myself (Recognizing and addressing mental health needs, Managing primary care and chronic health issues, Seeking support for an acute health event, Maintaining my health)
- Retiring (Taking care of my health)
- Aging (Managing my declining health)

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to **find out whether the questions drafted for the PACT Act Wizard are clear and easy enough for Veterans to understand and answer**.

### Outcome
Learnings will help refine individual questions and the overall list of them in the wizard.

### Research questions
1. What feedback do Veterans (and others) have on **individual questions**? 
1. What feedback do Veterans (and others) have on the **entire set of questions**?
     1. Are there so many questions that Veterans (and others) get frustrated or stop before the end?
     1. Are Veterans (and others) bothered by the repetitive construction of the questions?

1. Do Veterans (and others) **know enough about their military service to answer the questions**? If not, what do they need to answer them?

1. What feedback do Veterans (and others) have on the **results**?
     - date ranges
     - "presumptive conditions"
     - next steps
     

1. If the tool says that they're eligible, do they **feel like applying**?


### Hypotheses
1. Veterans (and others) will find the questions to be clear and easy to understand and answer.
2. Veterans (and others) will not be overwhelmed by the total number of questions they need to answer.
1. The results are simple enough for Veterans (and others) to understand and not seem misleading. 
1. Veterans (and others) will understand what "presumptive conditions" mean.
1. From the results screen, Veterans (and others) will know what they should do next. 

## Method	
We will conduct **usability testing** to guide research participants through a working prototype that presents the questions and results screens in the PACT Act wizard. 

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like **Zoom transcripts please**.

     1. No
     1. Yes *(RECRUIT 3 to satify "screen reader" criterion)*

     1. No
     2. Yes *(RECRUIT 4 and RECORD as having a cognitive disability)*

1. Do you identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community? We ask this question because we want to make sure the feedback we get from these sessions represents all the people we serve.

## Timeline--TBD

### Prepare
Before recruitment starts, I would like to **request a kickoff call with Perigean** to align on recruitment criteria and terminology for screener questions in the survey and emails that will be sent to Veterans. Wes and I are available for a kickoff call during any of these times: 
- **TBD ET**

**Prior to the kickoff call, I would like a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey** for this study so I can review it beforehand.

I have scheduled the following two **pilot tests**:
- Pilot 1: **TBD ET** with TBD (tbd@adhocteam.us)
- Pilot 2: **TBD ET** with TBD (tbd@adhocteam.us)

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: **TBD, 2023** 

We would like to request that **Perigean calls each participant** to remind them about the session, in addition to emailing them. And please include the session time **in each participant's own time zone** (from a screener question).

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
