# DRAFT VA Mobile App: Personalized Home Screen UI - Explorations, Audit & Refinement
August 2023


#### Guidelines for choosing a personalized home screen design direction
Choosing a design direction for the personalized home screen involves balancing user, business, and technical considerations. We will use the following criteria as a guide to systematically audit our personalized home screen design explorations and narrow options down to the direction/s we intend to move forward with.

## Criteria for Evaluating Personalized Home Screen Approaches

### Business Goals



1. Demonstrates the app’s value, even when there are no critical actions or updates to display, and regardless of the Veteran’s level of interaction with VA services.
2. High-level UI plan for personalized content is the same for every Veteran, on both iOS & Android platforms.
3. Approach is extensible & future proof—will accommodate new personalized content over time as APIs become available.
4. It is measurable (ideally using quant): It should be designed with data collection in mind.
5. It can be implemented incrementally enough that it allows the mobile app to be the first at VA to put a stake in the ground and define what “personalization” & “notifications” mean for the larger VA system (VA.gov, MHV).

### Veteran Mental Models/Needs

5. It feels tailored to the Veteran (about the Veteran’s individual relationship with the VA), even when there are no critical actions or updates to display.
6. It is task-based and emphasizes information that is actionable—it indicates urgency/lack of by making the difference between critical action items and non-critical items clear.
7. It is streamlined to avoid information overload: It reduces complexity by focusing users on primary tasks, free of distractions, and provides just enough information  (less is more).
8. It feels reassuring—it makes it quick and easy to see what VA is doing now, what has changed since their last visit, and/or to also explicitly confirm that there’s no action to take.
9. It’s accessible (including cognitive disabilities, assistive technology, ESL, etc). 

### Technical Considerations

10. The approach to displaying personalized content doesn’t negatively impact app responsiveness/speed (for example, limiting the number of API calls we make at one time).
