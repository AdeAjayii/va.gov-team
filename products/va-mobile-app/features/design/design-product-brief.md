# Mobile Design Product Brief
10/6/2021 / Updated 11/8/2021

## Vision for redesign (visual, interactions(may come later), and reorg improvements)

### Vision: Personalized, accessible, and future proof app design using modern native design language 

- Two exceptions - don’t need separate tablet/phone designs and we don’t need to differentiate between two platforms. We will tackle these two parts, if necessary, when we transition to native.
- Iterative - start with what we can build to test our riskiest assumption
- Setting an example that other teams can aspire to or adopt


## Assumptions/Hypotheses 
1. A revisit of the IA will likely result in a more personalized homepage to minimize taps
- How would we know? Lots of variation in groupings from user research
- Users asking for more personalized experience 
- Veterans’ experience change over time, from Veteran to Veteran 
- Many many tools 
- Temporal actions and information 
- Best practices? Expect an app to act in a certain way
2. That we need IA or a hierarchical/grouping way to display information 
- Benefits to adjacency 
- Some hybrid with maybe recents, some groupings, maybe favorites 
3. Our design language will need to evolve to accommodate a more personalized homepage/IA/search functionality 
4. Riskiest Assumption: Personalizing our design, modernizing our design language, and updating our IA will improve adoption and trust 
5. Search - Veterans have a lot of appointments/messages/payments and it would be useful to them to be able to search the app generally 
6. Smarter notifications? Not in this project but definitely revisit 

## Risks
1. VA.gov team and deviations from the design system/IA
2. Accessibility incompatible with modern native design language 
3. Screw up something that’s already working
4. Our egos 

## Redesign Process 
1. Redesign and IA: Full readout, structured plan for design 
- Milestones, dates, time boxes etc. 
- Align on approach options
- Iterate and plan research/submit research request (Tree Jack Testing on IA?)
2. Brainstorm session with entire group + synthesis 
- Approaches to wireframes with specific hypotheses 
3. Get complexity estimates from engineering
4. Iterate and align on wireframes
5. Conduct user research 
6. Synthesis and decision on “MVP”

## Measures of Success
### Primary: Veteran adoption, trust 
- Qualitative - hear more enthusiasm in user research, Veterans would easily find the features they’re searching for
- Number of taps to key tools go down 
### Secondary: Reputational and Stakeholder Benefits
- How to measure? Improve VA’s reputation and ability to design first class apps - we want this thing to win awards
- People continue to be proud of the work and want to show it off - demo to new stakeholders, they’d be like how can we help, this looks great, want to be champions for the app 
- MHV coordinator or clinician enthusiasm
