## Purpose:
Determine the best way for Veterans to find their prescriptions.

**Problem:**

How might we help Veterans easily find and manage their meds (i.e which do they need more of, what actions should they take)?

**Question to answer:** 

Would adding a search &/or scan functionality on the mobile app better support Veterans in finding the prescriptions they need faster and with ease?

**Focus Market research** on Scan Feature used by other Commercial Apps (i.e. Retail Pharmacy & Mail Order Pharmacy)

- What are other commercial apps are doing
- How have they incorporated scan
- Those commercial apps that have also included search functionality
- What are the differences from Retail Pharmacy & Mail order pharmacy
- What are some of the reasoning that retail pharmacy put scan in place

Out of Scope

- Direct user research
