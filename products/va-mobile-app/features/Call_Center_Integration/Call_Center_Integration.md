## Problem Statement

### Current Experience ###

* There are places in the app where we display phone numbers to call the VA.  A user is able to tap on the phone numbers to initiate a call.  When the number called is the VA Call Center, the call will be initiated and it will look to the Call Center like any other call coming through.

### Desired Outcomes ###

* We would like to have the ability for phone calls to the VA Call Centers initiated to pass along additional information to the Call Center system to identify the call as coming from the VA Mobile App.  This will allow the Call Center to better help the Veteran by providing more specific help.
