## Decision Log

This will be used to track all the major decisions made over the course of the project. 
It explains the reasons for each decision, so team members can identify their original motivations in case of confusion, disagreements, or unexpected changes to the project.








## Q & A

|Question| Answer|
|------| --------------------|
| CIE team assumes that the scope of this work is limited to the following: (1) Mobile app sends our API the patient and appointment identifiers for a single patient & appointment (2) API checks-in the identified patient for the identified appointment (3) API sends back success/error information <br><br>CIE team assumes that Pre-Check-in tasks (i.e. contact information verification) is not part of the scope<br><br>Are these assumptions correct? ||
| Similar to the above - very early scope conversations had potentially included geolocation or push notifications, to proactively alert veterans that they could do check-in on the mobile app. <br><br> It sounds like the actual MVP scope will be limited to displaying a way to enter the check-in workflow, from (somewhere still TBD) in the mobile app, WITHOUT push notifications, geolocation, or any other proactive method of letting veterans know check-in is possible. Is that assumption correct? ||
| Seems to be a direct contradiction in the Check-in MVP requirements document between these two sections: <br><br> - <b>Discovery questions and answers #7:</b> How will feature like travel reimbursement be integrated in the check-in experience and are there important milestones there? a. There has been a ton of work done on how travel reimbursement will be integrated into the day-of check in workflow. I donâ€™t think this is relevant for MVP, however. The check-in team can provide more details + research + wireframes + architecture if desired. <br> - <b>Acceptance criteria #7:</b> Views a confirmation message with directions on what to do next a. Info on how to request travel pay <br><br> Which of these two is correct? Is incorporating travel pay information into check-in part of MVP, or not?  | The CIE team is currently incorporating a feature to allow a Veteran to submit a travel claim as part of eCheck-in, however, it is currently in a research phase and not available in production, nor will it be for a few months; the mobile app team is welcome to use the BTSSS API to submit a travel claim directly (currently only mileage-only claims are available via the API)|
|Acceptance criteria 5 in the Check-in MVP scope document includes requirements to inform the veteran of why check-in is not possible on the app, with a specific example of being outside of the time window where check-in is allowed for an appointment. <br><br> Does the scope of this requirement include informing the veteran when mobile check-in is not enabled by a location? (Discovery questions & answers 3b: roughly half of clinics DO NOT have mobile check-in enabled) <br> Similarly, does the scope of this requirement cover any other known circumstances where check-in would not be available on mobile for a veteran? ||
|The path for check-in on the standalone web app (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/checkin/engineering/qa/test-cases-check-in.md#test-case-a-happy-path---successful-check-in) is predicated on a workflow of "answer check-in related questions (if not answered within past 7 days)" THEN "view list of appointments" THEN "click check-in for specific appointment". <br><br> The entry point for check-in on the mobile app has not been determined, but initial conversations within the mobile app team had it located somewhere within the appointments list or appointment details for a veteran, rather than a standalone activity that pulls appointments information. We've definitely run into problems in the past where the API(s) available for a new feature required using the exact same sequence as the current team, and did not support re-ordering of the workflow to better fit within the mobile app IA (ex: "view list of appointments" THEN "click check-in for a specific appointment" THEN "answer check-in related questions (if not answered within past 7 days)" <br><br> Have we been able to confirm whether reordering the sequence of steps in the workflow is possible with the check-in API(s)? | The CIE team determines if the Veteran has, within 7 days of the appointment, verified their contact information; if the info needs to verified the Veteran is asked to verify if the contact information is still correct; if the contact info is not correct, the Veteran is asked to check-in with a staff member; I don't know if that process will be part of your MVP or not |
