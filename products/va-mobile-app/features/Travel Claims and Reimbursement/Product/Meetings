3/8 Lead Discussion 

Review last week's action items 





3/1 Leads Discussion on Next Steps for 3 use cases 
Meeting notes: 
 Answered the 2 questions posted in QA shared worksheet, reviewed answers in the meeting 
 Reviewed how we should define use cases for Mark 
    Keep it high level, do not need to go into fields, comps, details initially
    Mark can come back with questions and we can handle accordingly
    We will work what goes into the doc like "Jobs to be done" 
  Identified that end of March is not a hard and fast due date but would like to back into a due date to help put milestones/action plan together 
  Agreed to use the same time moving forward weekly to review TR 
    If actions / items needed prior to next meeting bring them up vs waiting for the meeting
    Start with 30 minutes, if we end early we end early 
  Discussed research needs
    Short term to use existing research to help influence what further research is needed
    See if there are plans on what TR looks like at different facilities 
    Given the long term aspect of TR there may be opportunity for a more focused, detailed study 
Action Items:
  Estimate timing needs for research work - Liz 
  Share use case document to team - Adam - done see link
  Review use case document along with what existing research says for priority of use cases - Liz/Lauren
  Have FE assigned to epic - Adam - done 
   Per Binny they should only be included when there are front in design / functionality, given this is not part of our current needs they will not be asked to attend the meetings 



2/28/23 Mark Slack 
  Reached out for proof of concept API documentation, which he sent
  Sent the documentations to Jayson to review 
  Shared that high level use cases are fine. If its a crazy complex idea then maybe lo-fi comps may be needed. just wants enough details to show to team and say this is the stuff they are looking to do, lets peel it back
  End of March for 3 use cases would work for Mark
  They are targeting end of March to get the API working in order to restart the check in pilot



2/15/23 Matt 1:1 - Follow-up on TR 
  Adam offered to do a write up on status / updates 
  Discussed what mobile team can do
    Can we jump the line and get them over the finish line
      Check-In team has at least 9 months of work on us with an existing pilot just waiting for the API to be usable 
      They have a working pilot / experiment its just slow cause of the POC API 
      API is needed - we cannot speed that up; we can influence future APIs with Mark’s ask of the 3 TR use cases in Mobile 
    Governance play / strategy 
      Talked about running as an experiment for a product / feature
        That is what Check-In is doing 
      Think about strategy on governance
     Could use this as an example for the basic needs Mobile needs before proceed, if they do not have that what do we do
  No info on how Check In team is moving forward in regards to the pilot halt



2/15/23 Slack message with Mark Dewey
  Check In Team pivoting from pilot with some short term stress - no additional details, next steps, timing, etc provided - felt they were still figuring it out 
  Recommend a biweekly async Slack check in until there is more momentum 
  Still feels there is opportunity to influences what are in future API builds that would be used to incorporate into the mobile app 
  Said the 3 use cases should be mid-high priority; not needed now but getting them in on the ground floor of the work is best - so not time table 



2/14/23 - Sprint 0 
  Chris asked for update & confirmed their pilot is on hold
  Reiterated our dependency on APIs(that are not yet built or sustainable) to do TR other than an information page  
  Chris also felt just adding an info page and connecting to a poor experience is not ideal 



2/14/23 - Team of teams Update 
  Pre-Check In Pilot with TR Simple Claim put on hold 



2/10/23 - TR overview for Ad Hoc leads
  Re-reviewed parts of the Sprint 0 - user experience flow, problems 
  Created a QA doc for the leads to add to  
  Leads are hesitant on the research that exists, mobile may need to do one 



2/8/23 - Lead Meeting w Lauren, Misty, Liv, Meko
  Meko recommended this team, as they already had talks about TR during their Check In sprint 0 prep work prior to pulling out TR 
  Reviewed Mark’s 2 asks but prioritized the 1st - add information to the app about TR like VA.gov 
   Something we can control and do now, resolves some research findings 
   Leads felt that an info page in the app is not ideal plus to link user to BTS3 site which is not mobile or accessibility friendly is a poor experience 
  Created a Slack channel with this group to do async discussion and created a QA doc, per their request, for leads to fill out for future discussion
  Leads felt more research was needed though there has been 2 associated with it in the past 1 year or at least interview mobile veteran users 
  Asked for a walkthrough on the user experience - said we can revisit the sprint 0  



2/6/23 intro meeting with Mark via Slack
  Aware of the limitations and challenges with BTS3
  Reconfirmed all that was seen in the Check In Team Discovery with Travel Reimbursement work 
   Working to improvement TR experience but there is no access currently within the BTS3 walls - APIs are needed
   POC API for Simple Claim but poor response time 20 seconds - API was never intended for production use, purely a proof of concept 
  Pilot team reviewing if they want to test with 20 second latency 
  Octo wants to build additional APIs - eligibility check, claim look up, expand simple claim submission, etc 
    Said we could help influence this by sharing our top 3 use cases
  Mark recommended our next steps are 2 asks; outside of this there isn’t anything to do 
    Add an informational section to the mobile app regarding TR similar to what VA.gov 
    Provide top 3 ideal use cases to what mobile would do with TR to help Mark in preparing future APIs for RT 



1/31/23 Sprint 0 reviewed 
  Details on data, user experience, mail / online, etc 
  Pulled in research from Octo Path Analysis June 2022 and Check In Team Discovery with Travel Reimbursement which led to learnings such as 
   Online TR claim process currently has no integration points for the Mobile or any team to use  
      Submitting, viewing, status, associating to an appointment, seeing reimbursement payments, etc
      Thus the mobile team can’t develop or plan to develop as there is nothing to work off of 
  Check-In team since at least 2Q 2022 was preparing a Pre-Check In pilot that includes a single use case for TR they are calling Simple Claim 
    Check In Team Discovery with Travel Reimbursement
    Simple Claim = mileage reimbursement only for round trip using their own vehicle
    They planned to used a proof of concept API to do the TR 
      API only did simple claims but had 20 second response latency
      Again proof of concept build, not productionalized 
    Check-In Team performed research, collaboration and discussion with impacted teams
    They have created and finalized an entire customer experience journey and UI for the pilot 
    Pilot was only going to be for a couple VA locations as not all use check in
  Chris said to work with Octo Mark Dewey for all things related to TR
