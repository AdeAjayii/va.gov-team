# Conversation Guide: Appointment Request Usability


## **Research Goals**



1. Discover the Veteran’s mental models surrounding their current appointment scheduling experience. Find opportunities, pain points.
2. Assess the usability of appointment statuses and the ability to cancel previous requests. Gather feedback on how they interpret the information.


### Assumptions

**Request appointment flow**: users are just entering a time / date / appt type / 3 times. They don’t know what they are requesting, or how long it will take.. Set expectations for what to get at the end of the process.


## **Method**

Moderated study consisting of a mix of validation and discovery tasks. Ask what device they intend to use, and which tool they normally use. How proficient or comfortable are you with using the device? Is it your primary device? Recruit some with color blindness?


## **Introduction**

Thanks for joining the session! My name is Lauren and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to discuss your general thoughts around medical appointments and take a look at the Appointments feature within the VA Mobile App.



* **Before we start, a few things I want to mention. **This entire session should take about an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran’s needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express. We welcome all of your feedback.
* **We are going to be talking about your experience with VA healthcare.** Please don’t feel pressured to share any personal information. Since we are discussing appointment logistics, feel free to leave out any specifics of your particular health care plan. **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
* **Are you comfortable if I record the session?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
1. **If yes:** Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more. **[Start recording]**
* **I have started recording**. I’d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## **Warm up**



1. For you, what stands out as a meaningful experience that you’ve had at the VA?
2. What services do you use at the VA?
    1. **(If they don’t mention healthcare)** Have you ever used VA to manage your healthcare? What services?
3. How do you typially access these services? Website, phone call, something else?
4. Anything else? Transition?


## **Tasks**


### Task 1: Current appointment experience discovery interview. Conversational.

Thank you for providing that information. It's helpful for me to understand your experience across a range of products. Now I want to ask you some questions about your overall experience with scheduling apppointments. 

**Overview**



1. Tell me your overall experience with booking appointments
    1. What things are more important to you? 
    2. What things are less important to you?
2. How frequently do you make healthcare appointments? 
3. Do you book appointments online, over the phone, in person or a combination?
    3. What are some pain points about that experience? 

**Upcoming appointments**



4. How do you keep track of your upcoming appointments?
5. How far in advance do you schedule your appointments? Why?
6. Have you ever requested an appointment where you had to select different time slots? 
7. What are some actions you normally take leading up to an appointment? 



**After an appointment**



8. What are some actions you normally take after an appointment has occured?
9. Based on everything mentioned, do you manage VA appointments the same or differently from appointments outside the VA? 
    4. If different, tell me more about this.
10. If you could change one thing about the last experience, what would it be?

**Things to watch: **How the participant uses digital services to manage appointments. General actions they expect to occur after making an appointment.


### Task 2: Appointment Request usability test. In-app or prototype

Thank you for your insight. Now, I’d like to take a look at a list in the mobile app. If you have the handy, feel free to navigate to it and share your screen. If you don’t have it, no worries. I can share my screen and navigate locally if you tell me where to go.  

[Link to prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/7af71fd5-b940-4196-9402-c34b0861b441/a/9PJ5K9n)

1. What stands out to you first when looking at the landing screen?
    1. Tell me more, or why is that?
2. What does “Request Appointment” mean to you?
    2. Does that feel useful?
3. **PROMPT: **Imagine you need to make a few appointments in the future. While there, you also need to fetch the dates for ones you’ve previously confirmed so that you can tell a friend. You also need to cancel the one you previously created on MM/DD/YYYY.  
    3. What felt useful about those interactions?
    4. What were some pain points?
    5. If you had any questions where would you get the answers?

**Things to watch: **Observe all interactions as the participant interfaces with the Appointments feature in the app. When scanning the list, do they make comments on what data is displayed? Do they expect additional data, and how do they get it?
