# Research Plan: Appointment Request Usability Study


## **Background**

As a Veteran who uses the VA Mobile App (or other schedulers) I want to understand the mental model of appointments with existing statuses (Pending, Confirmed, and Canceled) and testing usability of the Appointment Request flow. 

Assume I have requested an appointment in VAOS (authenticated experience), or somewhere else. I want to ensure the experience is reflected in the VA Mobile App, so that I can either start or continue to use the VA Mobile App to manage my appointments.

#### Measures to increase



* Completion rate of online transactions
* Usage of digital, self- service tools
* Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)


#### Measures to decrease



* Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
* Time from online benefit discovery to benefit delivery
* Time to successful complete and submit online transactions

## **Research goals**



1. Discover the Veteran’s mental models surrounding their current appointment scheduling experience. Find opportunities, pain points.
2. Assess the usability of appointment statuses and the ability to cancel previous requests. Gather feedback on how they interpret the information.


#### Details

We want to understand how Veterans interact with their appointment schedule. Specifically, we will gain insight on current work and also observe Veterans interacting with the experimental concepts in real time. These sessions will provide clarity for what is useful currently and what particular insights can improve the Appointment experience within the VA Mobile App. 


#### Outcome

Other team’s research informed the MVP phase to display Pending Appointments. Now that the work is implemented, we will use this session to evaluate the feature’s efficacy and inform the next design phase.


#### Research questions

Conversations about healthcare and appointments provide insight into their experience, whether at the VA or somewhere else. This will also get participants thinking about appointments and their individual experiences. Running a usability test on the prototype helps to evaluate hypotheses made when designing the MVP, and also informs the next phase.


#### Hypothesis

With various digital products offering ways to book appointments for various tasks, most users expect a certain behavior. The discovery portion will uncover the expectations for the VA through how they’ve experienced this task in other places. If they only use the VA for this task, then the information received will inform how to provide the service in the mobile context.

Participants will easily find Pending appointments alongside their other confirmed, canceled and past appointments because of the label. The Pending label will have the intended meaning for some participants, not all. They will likely desire an improvement to the way the appointments are organized. 

Tapping into the Details screen will give them all of the expected details, though some may express the need for additional details they do not see. Actions they can take within this screen will also be in line with ones they would expect to be there. They also see they can Cancel a request and successfully do it.


## **Method**

This is a moderated, semi-structured interview with usability testing. It is a remote study using Zoom. 

For conducting the study, ask what device they intend to use in the session, and how it compares with the tool they normally use (if different). Things like: /How proficient or comfortable are you with using the device? Is it your primary device?/

## **Recruitment**


### Approach

The intended audience for this study are Veterans who have had a medical appointment, either at the VA or private care. Secondary participants include caregivers or anyone else who uses the VA Mobile App to manage appointments on a Veteran’s behalf.

We aim to recruit less represented participants so that we can have statistics that truly reflect mobile users. As recommended by OCTO, inclusive research will be critical to our findings.


### Recruitment criteria


#### Primary criteria

Mobile users with wide-ranging demographics who digitally manage healthcare appointments anywhere. Users who currently use the VA Mobile App.


#### Secondary criteria

Caregivers who manage appointments for another person. Color blind mobile users. Participants who have recently scheduled an appointment with the VA in the past year (2021-2022).
