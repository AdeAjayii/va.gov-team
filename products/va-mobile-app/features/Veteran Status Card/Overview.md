# Veteran Status Card 
Veterans would benefit from an easy-to-access official Veteran ID card to use for receiving discounts and other private-sector benefits. There is currently no simple way to attain an ID like this. The current processes are cumbersome and long and not well known by Veterans. A widely accepted Veteran ID within the mobile app could prove a very useful feature for Veterans and greatly increase usage of the app.

As a Veteran with internet connectivity and as an authenticated uesr, I can discover & view and use in my VA Flagship App a Veteran Status card. 
## Problem Statement
 
When a Veteran calls a call center, the Veteran needs to go through a call tree, identify themselves, and start every conversation from scratch. Is there a way that the mobile app can reduce the burden on Veterans and improve their customer experience by passing some of this information to the call center?

- Veteran can access a digital card in the Flagship mobile app to display to applicable 3rd parties

### In Scope
 - Displaying information that the Flagship VA app already has access too 
 - Veteran name
 - Date of birth
 - VA Logo
 - Brand of Military
 - Dates of service ((If there were multiple service periods, choose status quo of current experience in mobile/web/va-profile))
 - Upon review of card information, sees info on how to revise data if needed
- VA can add info to this card in the future if a veteran becomes eligible to access x benefit (e.g. health service)
- No enrollment; has immmediate success 

### Risks and Assumptions 
 - Ceating a ‘competitor’ to the VIC could anger certain stakeholders (?)
     - Need to ensure creating an ID card that is not technically the VIC does not interfere with the VIC law
- Surfacing current VIC may not be technically possible and the owning group may not have interest in working with us
- If we aren't able to let the 3rd parties who currently accept VIC as a form of proof of Veteran status know that the digital VIC is an official form of Veteran ID, they may not accept it (and Veterans will be angry/disappointed/inconveniences in that moment, but it might also erode trust in VA & the app).
- We don't currently coordinate with VA comms team when we launch features.
- There are several other forms of ID that are currently accepted and used to get discounts(Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC), Department of Defense (DoD) Identification Card—either a Common Access Card (CAC) or Uniformed Services ID Card, or a state-issued driver’s license or ID with a Veterans designation), and Veterans may find it easier to use those instead.
- A significant number of Veterans are in situations where they don't already have a way to prove their Veteran status (ex:one of several other forms of accepted ID, a store-controlled Veteran registration system).
- A Veteran Status card displayed on a phone/in the VA mobile app will be accepted by 3rd parties as official proof of Veteran status.
- There will be marketing support for the new Veteran status card (to drive new app downloads).
- 3rd parties will accept a Veteran ID card without a photo
- Not replacing VIC, but providing the same value
- Stolen valor argument related to Veteran ID card without a picture
- Creating another unique identification card the Veterans will need to use / understand

### Open Questions
 - Do we need to add a [blurb](https://www.google.com/search?q=VIC+card&rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1029US1029&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjIrc_-oLyAAxVxHTQIHcsFCzwQ_AUoAXoECAMQAw&biw=1920&bih=923&dpr=1#imgrc=boL5w2x70sko8M) like VIC - "This card servces as proof of service....does not reflect entitlement...by the Department of Veteran Affairs"
