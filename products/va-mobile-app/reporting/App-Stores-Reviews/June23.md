I use it exclusively to refill my meds and message my doctor. The app is very quick and responsive. The "Service Letters" section (once complete) gives you access to your all your military/veteran/disability/commissary letters. \*\*\* Note to VA: Please fix the "Service Letters" module. I'm getting the 'Please Try Again' response for each letter. |
