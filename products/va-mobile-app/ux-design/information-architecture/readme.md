# Information Architecture

_Last updated: September 2021_

## Background & goals
The information architecture outlines the hierarchy the MVP app navigation follows. The goal of this is to outline all the screens and navigation UX in the app.

As of September 2021 the information architecture is still a living artifact. As the app changes, updates will be made and reflected [here](https://www.sketch.com/s/2f57b5b0-1b81-4237-a2e6-e522d5e37d11/a/L0j1lD5). Below is a screenshot of the IA as of September 30, 2021.
