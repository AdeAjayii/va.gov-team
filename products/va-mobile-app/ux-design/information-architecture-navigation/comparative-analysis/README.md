# VA Mobile Comparative Analysis: Navigation UI Patterns
Addresses [#2541](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va-mobile-app/issues/2541)

This work is part of the [VA Mobile App: Information Architecture & Navigation Project](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/High%20Level%20Project%20Summary.md)

## Background & Goals
The VA Mobile app was designed to allow Veterans to more easily complete key transactions across VA Health and Benefits services.

As the app grows in its feature set, the VA Mobile App team needs a better understanding of how Veterans would navigate benefits and health services within the mobile app. We want to ensure the structure and organization of the app makes sense and can accommodate the new features we have identified as of interest on our roadmap.

The goal of this comparative analysis is to answer the following questions: 
* What are the current trends and best practices in terms of navigation for mobile apps dealing with similar data needs? 
  * Are there navigation pattern differences between market sectors (health vs insurance vs travel, etc)?
* How are apps treating child pages, especially those that are accessible from multiple navigation stacks? 
  * Are they using descendant navigation and modality? Why?
* Do apps' navigation models tend to differ between platforms?
* What do these apps do well that we can apply to our context? What can we do better (for example, in regards to a11y)?

*Note: We utilized Mobbin as well as designers' personal devices to conduct the comparative analysis. The apps reviewed were primarily on iOS, but we cross-referenced the Google Play store to identify navigation differences between plattforms.*

## Apps Reviewed
Comparative analysis will include (but not be limited to) app examples that share similar features and/or functionalities with the VA mobile app (ex: robust user/account data, with an emphasis on omnichannel). Examples: government, but also health insurance, banking, retail, travel, tickets, whatever else feels like a good parallel in terms of IA needs)
