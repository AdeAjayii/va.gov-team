# VA: Health & Benefits mobile app content decision log
We started this decision log as of December 2023. We'll continue to update content decisions moving forward. We'll also fill in any decisions that were made pre-December 2023 as we can.

Its intention is to _highlight high-profile benefit and health-related updates for Veterans_. | Misty Milliron-Grant |
