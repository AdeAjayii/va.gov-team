Thoughts on Mobile metrics

### Overall Bet

What value does the app provide to Veterans? Our key hypothesis is that a native  mobile app provides value to Veterans by making it easier to complete transactions with VA.

How will we know whether we were right about this bet?

### Measures of Success for Veterans

Does the app provide value to Veterans? Do they enjoy using it? Do they use it a lot?

Objective: Veterans report that they enjoy using the app
-   KR: Maintain a high App Store and Google Play star rating (4 stars or above)
-   KR: Receive a high (>65%) proportion of positive comments

Objective: Veterans return to use the app on a recurring basis (indicating they find it valuable)

-   KR: maintain or increase repeat usage for the various features in the app compared to VA.gov or MHV (If users return multiple times to check their claim status or their appointments -- on par or above VA.gov -- we can assume that they find the app to be valuable)

(Next/Later?) Objective [once we have a more splashy app store launch]: All Veterans with smartphones, who consume VA services online, are able to access the app

-   KR: High usage of the app

-   KPI: number of app downloads

-   KPI: daily or monthly active users

-   KPI: number of times each feature is used (as an indication of how valuable it is)

Are transactions on the app simpler/faster/easier for Veterans to complete?

Objective: Vets can more easily complete transactions on the app than in corresponding web experiences

-   KRs: rate of task completion is on par with or higher than VA.gov or MHV counterpart

-   KPIs - rate of task completion for all features (for SM: percent of users who begin a message, who then send it; for VAOS: in the future, appointment completion rate in the funnel

-   KR - speed of task completion is on par with or higher than VA.gov or MHV counterpart

Objective: Vets can manage benefits across VA health and benefit silos in one place

-   KPI: number of sessions that include visits to both health and benefit features

Objective: Veterans can seamlessly login to the app (and find the experience easier than authentication on VA.gov or MHV)

-   KR: X% of users choose to allow biometric login (We hear from Vets how hard it is for them to login, turning on Touch ID or Face ID seems like a good indication that Vets find value in native functionality in the app)

-   KR: Login success rate matches or is higher than on VA.gov

-   KPI: Login success rate

Objective: Vets gain peace of mind by receiving alerts when the status of their benefit or health feature changes

-   KR: x% push notification opt in rate and open rate

-   KPI - push notification opt in rate and open rate

Objective: Vets can seamlessly interact with VA using affordances unique to a native app

-   KRs are about use of other native functionality (like, allowing location for Facility Locator, or adding a VAOS appointment to calendar, or uploading a claim file via camera, or sending an SMS via the Crisis Line link, or even clicking to call a phone number directly from the app)

### Source of value the app provides for OCTO and VA

-   Break down silos: Build closer ties between OCTO and OCC/MHV

-   Bi-weekly meetings increase visibility into each other's priorities and build trust and open communication channels

-   Demonstrate iterative, agile ways of product development to OCC

-   Sandbox: The app allows us to test new user flows in a new channel, while consuming the same backend MHV APIs (and in the future, Cerner APIs)

-   These might later pave the way for VA.gov to manage the frontend experience of health services for Veterans

-   New customer groups: Depending on what we learn from usage behavior, the app may allow VA to engage with groups of Veterans who might not otherwise be interacting with VA online

-   Feature differentiation: The mobile app allows us to provide some fundamentally different experiences than we can on websites (biometrics, push notifications, location

-   Granular customer behavior data: Amount of data we'll get on the app is much more granular than what exists on MHV etc, teaches us more about how Veterans interact with VA digitally

### How might our goal for the app change over time?

-   Now - Companion App: Vets who already consume VA services and engage with VA websites find it easier to complete transactions on the mobile app (companion to the website)

-   Next - Channel of Choice: Vets who find it easier to manage their benefits on the app will use the app more than they access that same feature on a VA websites (mobile app becomes their preferred channel)

-   Later - Acquisition: Increased engagement by new user group - Vets who do not already interact with VA online begin to use the app (increase the pie of Vets engaging with VA digitally)

### Open questions:

-   Is this a companion app, or do we want to shift volume from VA websites to mobile -- at least for the transactions that we build in the app?

-   Do we ever want the app to be a place where Veterans find new benefits?

Areas of consideration:

-   User groups: how do they change over time

-   What is the benefit to VA from the app? For us to get resources

-   How do we handle the soft launch aspect - ie, numbers of downloads will be low

-   "A subset of digitally engaged Vets shift preference from VA.gov to VA Mobile app for key transactions" is something we want to measure?

-   Relationship to VA.gov: do we cannibalize traffic for some users?

-   Or is it something we measure, before optimizing: we might find that it increases digital engagement overall (ie, Vets who interact more on mobile, also interact more on VA.gov and MHV)
