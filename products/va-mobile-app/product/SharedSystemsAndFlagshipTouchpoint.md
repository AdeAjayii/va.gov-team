This meeting is to discuss and address any dependencies between the VA Mobile Shared Systems teams and the Flagship teams that are using their systems.

**Agenda/Notes**

01/23/24
* **Discuss implementation of Design System components into the Flagship app (Kelly)**
* **Discuss Flagship building new components for the DS - Personalization (Kelly)**
* **Governance between teams on accessibility requirements (Matt)**
* **Test account management and data prepping process (Adam)**
  * Baseline:
      * Mobile reliance on VA - Mobile does not own test accounts as they are managed and owned by VA which includes creation and modification
      * VA can modify their test accounts data without Mobile knowing which can unexpectedly break existing Mobile tests or delay project testing  
      * Test account needs will require involving different VA areas and their processes (VAOS for Appts, Prescriptions for RX, etc) for new test account creation or requests to modify existing test accounts to meet Mobile's testing needs
      * QA can help identify what is needed but is reliant on the Team PM to coordinate with the OCTO PM on getting those needs met(accounts/data modification) 
         * Long Term QA Platform expectation is Test Account Management and Data prep would be done outside of QA
      * Though Global is not working on specific H&B projects, Global's testing needs will involve test accounts with H&B needs like Personalization currently does 
  * Problem 
      *  Not owning our own test accounts or means to modify test data leads to Mobile's reliance to VA processes and timing for test account needs 
         * Need to know VA PO process to create test accounts
         * Need to konw VA PO process to modify test accounts
   * Proposal
      * Include in Step 2 test account / data conversations
      * Collaborate with Mobile's OCTO POs in how to handle test account creation and data prepping need and document them 
      * Renew discussion with Rachel on getting our own test accounts and our own process to modify the data
