This meeting is to discuss and address any dependencies between the VA Mobile Shared Systems teams and the Flagship teams that are using their systems.

**Agenda/Notes**

01/23/24
* **Discuss implementation of Design System components into the Flagship app (Kelly)**
* **Discuss Flagship building new components for the DS - Personalization (Kelly)**
* **Governance between teams on accessibility requirements (Matt)**
* **Test account management and data prepping process (Adam)**
  * Baseline:
      * Mobile does not have access to prep our own test accounts or test data - making us reliant on VA teams to make the changes for us
      * Multiple areas use test accounts (research, review, testing, etc)
      * VA owns test account creation and modification & can modify the data when they need to - which can unexpectedly break existing Mobile tests or delay project testing  
      * Mobile's test account needs will require involving different VA areas and their different processes (VAOS for Appts, Prescriptions for RX, etc) 
      * QA can help identify what is needed but is reliant on the Team PM to coordinate with the OCTO PM on VA's processes ) 
      * Long Term Platform Strategy expectation is Test Account Management and Data prep would be done outside of QA
      * Though Global is not working on specific H&B projects, Global's testing needs will involve test accounts with H&B needs like Personalization currently does
  * Problem 
      *  Not owning our own test accounts or means to modify test data leads to Mobile's reliance to VA processes and timing for test account needs 
         * Need to know VA PO process to create test accounts
         * Need to konw VA PO process to modify test accounts
   * Proposal
      * Include in Step 2 test account / data conversations
      * Collaborate with Mobile's OCTO POs in how to handle test account creation and data prepping need which are then documented
      * Renew discussion with Rachel on Mobile getting our own test accounts and our own process to modify the data - upgrade default process
