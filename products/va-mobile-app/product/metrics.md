# Mobile App OKRs & Measures of Success

## Overall Bet

**What value does the app provide to Veterans? Our key hypothesis is that a native  mobile app provides value to Veterans by making it easier to complete transactions with VA.**

*How will we know whether we were right about this bet?*

## Measures of Success for Veterans

### Objective: Veterans enjoy using the app

- KR: Maintain a high App Store and Google Play star rating (4 stars or above)

- KR: Receive a high (>65%) proportion of positive comments


### Objective: Veterans the app valuable enough to download and use

- KR: maintain or increase repeat usage for the various features in the app compared to VA.gov or MHV (If users return multiple times to check their claim status or their appointments -- on par or above VA.gov -- we can assume that they find the app to be valuable)

- KR: High usage of the app _[once we have a more splashy app store launch]_

  - KPI: number of app downloads

  - KPI: daily or monthly active users

  - KPI: number of times each feature is used (as an indication of how valuable it is)


### Objective: Vets can more easily complete transactions on the app than in corresponding web experiences

- KRs: rate of task completion is on par with or higher than VA.gov or MHV counterpart

  - KPIs: rate of task completion for all features (for SM: percent of users who begin a message, who then send it; for VAOS: in the future, appointment completion rate in the funnel

- KR: speed of task completion is on par with or higher than VA.gov or MHV counterpart
  - KPIs:  speed of task completion for features (for SM: time it takes between clicking into the Secure Messaging feature, to send a message?)

- KR: Vets manage benefits across both health and benefits
  - KPI: number of sessions that include visits to both health and benefit features

- KR: Vets take advantage of native functionality in the app
_ie, was it the right bet to build this app natively?_
  - KPI: frequency of usage of allowing location services, or adding VAOS appointment to calendar, or using camera for uploading a claime file, or sending an SMS via the VCL link, or clicking to call a help line directly from the app


### Objective: Reduce the barriers to entry to accessing authenticated features

- KR: X% of users choose to allow biometric login _(we hear from Vets how hard it is for them to login, turning on Touch ID or Face ID seems like a good indication that Vets find value in native functionality in the app)_

- KR: Login success rate matches or is higher than on VA.gov

  - KPI: Login success rate

### Objective: Vets gain peace of mind by using the app
_Reducing the feeling of VA being a "black hole" or needing to be persistent to follow up on benefits_

- KR: x% push notification opt in rate and open rate


## Measures of Success for VA
**What sources of value does the app provide for OCTO and VA?**

- Break down silos: Build closer ties between OCTO and OCC/MHV

- Bi-weekly meetings increase visibility into each other's priorities and build trust and open communication channels

- Demonstrate iterative, agile ways of product development to OCC

- Sandbox: The app allows us to test new user flows in a new channel, while consuming the same backend MHV APIs (and in the future, Cerner APIs)

- These might later pave the way for VA.gov to manage the frontend experience of health services for Veterans

- New customer groups: Depending on what we learn from usage behavior, the app may allow VA to engage with groups of Veterans who might not otherwise be interacting with VA online

- Feature differentiation: The mobile app allows us to provide some fundamentally different experiences than we can on websites (biometrics, push notifications, location

- Granular customer behavior data: Amount of data we'll get on the app is much more granular than what exists on MHV etc, teaches us more about how Veterans interact with VA digitally

## How might our goal for the app change over time?

- Now - Companion App: Vets who already consume VA services and engage with VA websites find it easier to complete transactions on the mobile app (companion to the website)

- Next - Channel of Choice: A subset of Veterans _prefer_ managing their benefits on the app over using VA websites (mobile app becomes their preferred channel). Requires setting up analytics to track individual user's behavior across web and mobile

- Later - Acquisition: Increased engagement by new user group - Vets who do not already interact with VA online begin to use the app (increase the pie of Vets engaging with VA digitally)

## Open questions:

- Is this a companion app, or do we want to shift volume from VA websites to mobile -- at least for the transactions that we build in the app?

- Do we ever want the app to be a place where Veterans find new benefits?

- How will user groups change over time?

- What makes someone more likely to use our app? Are they highly digitally engaged across both web and mobile? Or are we reaching new and different users altogether?

- How do we handle the soft launch aspect - ie, numbers of downloads will be low from the start

- "A subset of digitally engaged Vets shift preference from VA.gov to VA Mobile app for key transactions": how can we measure this? 

- Relationship to VA.gov: do we cannibalize traffic for some users? Or we might find that it increases digital engagement overall (ie, Vets who interact more on mobile, also interact more on VA.gov and MHV)
