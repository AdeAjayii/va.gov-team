* There is capacity within VA to handle any influx in volume that comes from more messages being sent by Veterans For example, triage teams will be able to maintain service standards for response time even if the number of messages significantly exceeds the current volume. 
* More Veterans would use secure messaging on the mobile app compared to the web version

## Discovery Takeaways
### What is Secure Messaging?
Secure messaging is an online messaging system located on MyHealtheVet (MHV), a web property maintained by VA to connect Veterans with healthcare tools. Veterans and caregivers are encouraged to utilize Secure Messaging to ask questions about a broad range of topics, from non-urgent healthcare needs, to scheduling or confirming VA appointments, medications, and lab results. 

In its current state, Secure Messaging functions similarly to email and allows users to write a message, create/organize folders, view and attach documents. There are three different components within Secure messaging: a Veteran facing interface, a healthcare provider interface, and an administrator interface. This mural reviews the general categories of functionality between these three user groups. 

Overall, Secure Messaging is a highly utilized tool. Within 24 months, 1.26M Veterans have sent a secure message. The Secure Messaging inbox ranks as the third most popular page (653,357 pageviews) on MHV, only after the MHV homepage (2.56M pageviews) and the MHV login page (814,942 pageviews). While the majority of users access MHV from a desktop computer (63%), a significant portion of users are coming from a mobile device (32%) or a tablet (4.8%). 

### How do Veterans use secure messaging?
* Secure Messaging is trusted and often the primary method for veterans and caregivers to communicate with their care team other than in-person visits.

*“That is the easiest way to get ahold of them. Otherwise you are sitting on hold from 45 minutes to an hour trying to transfer through the systems. Then they will either call us or email back for the follow up.” - Veteran*
