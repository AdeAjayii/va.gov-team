# Secure Messaging Product Outline

## Vision
Foster trust and confidence between Veterans and their healthcare providers. 

## Mission
A human-centered and reliable experience that makes it easy for Veterans and caregivers to communicate with their healthcare teams outside of in-person appointments


# Assumptions
* Veterans prefer self-service to phone calls or face-to-face interactions 
* There is capacity within VA to handle any influx in volume that comes from more messages being sent by Veterans For example, triage teams will be able to maintain service standards for response time even if the number of messages significantly exceeds the current volume. 
* More Veterans would use secure messaging on the mobile app compared to the web version
