# Secure Messaging Product Outline

## Vision
Foster trust and confidence between Veterans and their healthcare providers. 

## Mission
A human-centered and reliable experience that makes it easy for Veterans and caregivers to communicate with their healthcare teams outside of in-person appointments


## Assumptions
* Veterans prefer self-service to phone calls or face-to-face interactions 
* There is capacity within VA to handle any influx in volume that comes from more messages being sent by Veterans For example, triage teams will be able to maintain service standards for response time even if the number of messages significantly exceeds the current volume. 
* More Veterans would use secure messaging on the mobile app compared to the web version

## Discovery Takeaways
### What is Secure Messaging?
Secure messaging is an online messaging system located on MyHealtheVet (MHV), a web property maintained by VA to connect Veterans with healthcare tools. Veterans and caregivers are encouraged to utilize Secure Messaging to ask questions about a broad range of topics, from non-urgent healthcare needs, to scheduling or confirming VA appointments, medications, and lab results. 

In its current state, Secure Messaging functions similarly to email and allows users to write a message, create/organize folders, view and attach documents. There are three different components within Secure messaging: a Veteran facing interface, a healthcare provider interface, and an administrator interface. This mural reviews the general categories of functionality between these three user groups. 

Overall, Secure Messaging is a highly utilized tool. Within 24 months, 1.26M Veterans have sent a secure message. The Secure Messaging inbox ranks as the third most popular page (653,357 pageviews) on MHV, only after the MHV homepage (2.56M pageviews) and the MHV login page (814,942 pageviews). While the majority of users access MHV from a desktop computer (63%), a significant portion of users are coming from a mobile device (32%) or a tablet (4.8%). 

### How do Veterans use secure messaging?
* Secure Messaging is trusted and often the primary method for veterans and caregivers to communicate with their care team other than in-person visits.

* Secure Messaging supports other core tasks on MHC, such as prescription refills, scheduling appointments, and ordering medical equipment 

* Secure messaging is viewed as the best way to get in touch with doctors directly, albeit messages are often triaged by a nurse first. 

* Secure messaging is cited as beneficial as a record of communication with care teams, especially for those with memory/cognitive concerns, and/or veterans and caregivers co-managing communications. 

#### Veteran Quotes 
*“That is the easiest way to get ahold of them. Otherwise you are sitting on hold from 45 minutes to an hour trying to transfer through the systems. Then they will either call us or email back for the follow up.” - Veteran* 

*“This is my best means of communication with my doctor” - Veteran*

## Strategic Bets
### Short Term 
* We believe delivering a pared down version of the existing Secure Messaging experience is in alignment with the overarching goal of the mobile app, which is to provide a faster and easier way to complete transactions with VA. 
* Our hypothesis is that maintaining the current experience, rather than reimagining a newone, will build Veteran trust with the messaging service and the app overall. 
#### Proof Points
* We know that Secure Messaging is a highly requested feature for the mobile app. In a co-design research study for the mobile app, secure messaging was added by 5 out of 7 participants and cited as a top priority by 1 participant. Based on its importance to users, secure messaging will be included in the mobile app store release. 

*"[The first thing I would add is] Secure Messaging - it's hard to quantify [why this is valuable] because it can be used on phone today [using MHV] - but if you didn't have to log in every time that would be helpful." -- P4 (freeform)*

* 32% of users access MHV from their mobile device, indicating interest in and need for a mobile friendly experience focused on quick, transactional tasks.
