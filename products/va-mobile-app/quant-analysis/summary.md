# Analytics Summary

August 18, 2020

# Background & goals
We referenced analytics for VA.gov as well as My HealtheVet and eBenefits to understand what was most highly visited on VA sites. We used analytics to help make decisions about the MVP feature set. 


## Analytics review
### Claims & appeals
- The claim status tool is the most popular tool on VA.gov outside of the homepage. From May 1, 2019-May 1, 2020, tracking claim or appeal status accounted for just under 8% of all traffic on VA.gov.
- Of the top 10 pages during this time frame, 3 relate to claims (#3, #5, #7). 

### My HealtheVet & health features
Overall, across VA sites, these three pages rank in the top 10 most popular:  
- Messaging their medical teams (~56MM page views)
- Refilling Rx (~47MM page views)
- Viewing labs and tests (~25MM page views)




## Previous research review
The Logged In homepage team put together [a summary of analytics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#logged-in-homepage-discovery-analytics-review) as part of discovery. Some key findings from this effort that are extremely useful for mobile app are:
- On the modernized site (va.gov), the claim status tool is king [(source).](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#on-the-modernized-site-vagov-the-claim-status-tool-is-king)
- People start on the homepage, the claim status tool, and the facility locator [(source).](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#people-start-on-the-homepage-the-claim-status-tool-and-the-facility-locator)
- In the non-modernized data (VA.gov plus MHV, eBenefits, etc.), we can see just how important health care management is to the veteran population [(source).](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#in-the-non-modernized-data-vagov-plus-mhv-ebenefits-etc-we-can-see-just-how-important-health-care-management-is-to-the-veteran-population)



## Call center data
From  6/1-10/25/19, there were 673,882 calls recorded to VBA NCC. The top driver for calls was claims. Claims accounted for ~42% of all calls (284,822).
- Of calls where claims was the driver, ~88% of calls were to check general status. 
- After general status, the next most common reasons for calling are document verification and exam. However these clock in at ~5% and ~3% respectively, showing how much volume VBA NCC gets regarding claims status.
