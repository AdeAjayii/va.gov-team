Haptics in the VA Health and Benefits App only works if the Veteran's device haptic setting is on

Logic
  This app, in the long term, wants to use device settings vs having to create it's own 
    Example be like Dark Mode and less like Notifications 
    Decided for Haptics to treat it like Dark Mode 
    So decided to treat it like dark mode now vs having to switch it later 
      Save dev work/effort now and later 
  Haptics will be tied to the component level 
  
Things to keep in mind
    Not all devices support haptics
    Not all device operation system support haptics 
    Each device and operating system has their own location and verbiage for it's haptic settings 
    Not all operating systems support the same haptic options - thus used 3 pattern instead of 4 
      Currently our own library also has limitations as it does not support 4 pattern 
  
 Haptic settings in use
   Component            When haptics occurs       Haptic Pattern
   Snack Bar            Appearance                3 pattern
   Toggle               Interaction               Heavy toggle
   Error Alert Box      Appearance                3 pattern
   Warning Alert Box    Appearance                3 pattern 


Risks
  Veteran cannot turn on of off haptics just in the app
  Limited insight into haptic engagement given we do not have our own setting 
  No proactive awareness outside of Whats New in the app store so may catch the Veteran off guard
