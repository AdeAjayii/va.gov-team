# VA Mobile App
The flagship mobile app (VA: Health and Benefits) is delivering two key improved experiences to Veterans who already have a digital relationship with VA.
1. Streamlining sign in with biometric authentication
2. Pulling together access to common tasks that cut across VA organizational lines (VHA, VBA, NCA)
  - Appointments (continued development)
  - Claim Status
  - Download VA Letters
  - VA Payments
  - Prescription Refills (in development)
  - Secure Messages

The mobile app team has a hypothesis, validated by user research, that native functionality in a mobile app can allow Veterans to more easily complete key transactions across VA Health and Benefits services.

## Background
Traffic to VA websites is typically driven by users that want to complete quick transactions, such as view the status of claims, read Secure Messages, or use the Facility Locator. Currently, about 40% of overall visits to VA.gov are made  with mobile devices.

Sign in to VA websites is a commonly cited pain point, and this is especially onerous when the task you are trying to complete only takes a few seconds ("has my claim advanced?" "Did my doctor get back to me?"). Mobile devices can streamline this with easy to use biometric authentication that many veterans have already integrated into their daily lives. These devices have other capabilities— like location, camera, and local storage— that we think have greart potential to improve the Veteran experience.

In 2020, we undertook a discovery sprint to understand how Veterans were currently using mobile devices with VA and what they wished they could do more easily. That research led to the MVP feature set and our ongoing work with Veterans continues to guide the product roadmap today.
