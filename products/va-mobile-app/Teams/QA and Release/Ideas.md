## How we can improve testing and release process


| Idea / Open Item | Comments | Owner | 
| ---- | ------ | ------ | 
|  Require unit tests to be completed before feature goes into production |  I have gotten positive backing from Binny, Kelly and Stacy |  Adam | 
|  Require detox UI updates to be part of new changes before going to production - reduce QA backlog work and improve testing quality / timing | I have gotten positive backing from Binny, Kelly and Stacy |  Adam | 
|  Have engineering do some preliminary demo mode test before QA - seen demo mode broken or changes not there in QA that could have been caught earlier if engineering did it  |  Adam | 
|  Have Demo mode be updated with any changes - this impacts detox testing and manual testing  |  |  Adam | 
|  Consider having Mobile teams update detox testing vs having QA do it - some FE do it already today | |   Adam | 
|  Create a PR turn around policy for QA review ; Set a PR review SLA - say a PR is assigned to you to review then have it closed in 2 business days?  | |  Adam |  
|  Review what meetings are critical and needed for QA to attend vs optional | | Team | 
|  Explore the possibility of keeping the last 2 days of the sprint open from QA to focus on just testing   | | Team |
|  Require visual QA tickets that UX needs to complete prior to QA starting testing | | Adam | 
|  Make Visual QA tickets required for MVP - push Visual QA responsibilities on UX and less on QA | | Adam | 
|  Create a policy on steps to include new work after release branch has been cut |  In progress - shared draft with Tom on 12/11 | Adam | 
|  Document QA work within the Kanban board columns | | | 
|  Document hot fix process / requirements / timing | | | 
|  How to educate / onboard external teams in regards to QA testing, testing requirements (detox, etc.)  | | | 
|  Release / RC tester for 1Q 2024 | | Team | 
|  New cadence of meetings for 2024 | Waiting till after Mobile team's keep / delete team meeting review | Team | 




| Closed items | Resolution | Date |
| ----- | ----- | -------| 
|  Have Teams assign their QA Agent to tickets that need testing - tickets aren't labeled right and requires manual scrubbing reviewing for each sprint | Shared with PMs and all of them agreed to this, shared out in Slack thread.  If you do not see this bring it up in your team's ceremonies | Dec 2023 |
| Teams assigned a QA Agent | Therese - Global; Tom - Health and Benefits; Rachael - API / Design System / Floater | Nov 2023 |
| Release RC Tester Agent for rest of the quarter | Tom | Nov 2023 
| Team ticket label | QA and Release | Nov 2023 |
