**Notes and tips for future UAT**
1. Look at past UAT sessions for lists of participants if you need to recruit.

2. When corresponding with participants prior to the session, be sure to give them a heads up on everything they might need for the sessions such as: their ID, their e-mail and password, any apps they need on their phone, and a reminder to join the meeting on their phone. 

Example of e-mail: 


    We are looking forward to the UAT login.gov session today at 3pm EST. 


    As a reminder here is a list of things you will need for the session:


    1. The Zoom app on your phone (you will be joining the session from your phone). If you need the zoom for the meeting sent to an e-mail you open on your phone such as a personal e-mail, let me know. Or you can forward this email to your personal e-mail and open it from there.


    2. Testflight or Firebase downloaded on your phone by following the instructions I sent in the prior e-mail. Please let me know if you have any questions or need help with that prior to the session if possible. 


    3. Your driver's license/ state ID. 


    4. The username and password for your personal e-mail. You will need this handy when asked to sign into your e-mail in order to verify your account. 

3. When setting up the time, give the participant a choice of 3 times. If they need to join from their phone make sure you send the invite/ zoom link to their personal e-mail or whatever email they have on their phone. 

4. Create a sign up sheet for note takers and observers to sign up. 

5. Create a note taking sheet where you can collect all of the notes from the sessions.

6. Message note takers or first time observers to let them know what to expect. 


    Example message: \
Hi! Thank you so much for volunteering to take notes for [login.gov](http://login.gov/) UAT, I really appreciate it! A few things that might help:

- On the sign up the participantet, in column A it says the participant #. This is the participant you are taking notes for and you will want to take notes in the correct tab. (You will be taking notes for P2 and P7) They are not in order by date of session.
- In DSVA slack [#feedback-backchannel](https://adhoc.slack.com/archives/C02SNCCD6P8)  is a feedback thread I will start 10 minutes before the session, its where all the cool people hang out during the session/ all the observers. I will try to keep my eye on it so that if you are offering support/ ideas on how to help I can see it. This is a good spot to call things out you think are interesting too.
- Remember to mute yourself and change your name to 'Observer' and turn your camera off.
- The main focus of the UAT is to see if the User's data is populating correctly so for example: Are all of their appointments displaying etc. The secondary is to see how [login.gov](http://login.gov/) is working and if they are getting stuck anywhere. 

7. Before the session, make sure you have a tab with your conversation guide, a tab with the sign-up sheet, and a tab with the android/ios test app instructions if they need help troubleshooting. It is also helpful to have access to the developer view of the test app open just in case you need to resend the invite e-mail.
