## Payments Mobile App Test Plan

### Objective/Summary
What to test - We need to verify, in pre-prod and prod, that:
User data end points are sending the correct Payments data, and different variations of Payments data are displaying correctly. 
Who can do this testing and how?
In pre-Production, the mobile app team has conducted testing internally
Dev Unit Testing
QA Validation
QA Regression (testing basic functionality of features)
We will recruit 5 participants (between known contacts and VA Veteran recruits) in order to test data in Production.
Criteria: Users must have a history of Payments records in order to qualify for UAT.  
Test Scenarios
User has 1 or more Payments that are displayed on the Payments History page with the correct amount and date 
User can select any payment to see Payment Details, which contains the payment’s Title, Date, and Method at minimum 
User has Payments that occurred across multiple years 
User has Payments that are delivered via Direct Deposit 
User has Payments that are delivered via Paper Check

No other fields, besides amount, are listed

Testing Approach
Recruited users will be sent an instructional email that describes the testing process, and illustrates the flow users will follow to complete UAT (see Tester Steps to Execute). 

The email will include yes/ no questions that ask the user to verify that their data is displaying correctly. The questions have been structured in such a way to ensure that users are not revealing personal or sensitive information over email. 

“Are you able to load your payments on the Payments list page? Yes/ No
Are they organized by date? Yes/ No
Does each payment list the Payment Type and correct Amount in this format $X,XXX.XX? Yes/ No
Are you taken to a Payment Details page when you select each Payment? Yes/ No 
If you have Payments spanning across multiple years, are you able to use the year picker at the top to select from disparate years? Yes/ No 
Do your payments load for each year? Yes/ No 
If you have a Direct Deposit payment, do the details list the Method as Direct Deposit? 
Do the additional fields show the Bank and last 4 digits of the Account Number? Yes/ No
If you have a payment sent to you by check, do the details list the Method as Paper Check? Yes/ No 

If you answered “No” to any of these, please include a brief explanation. 

Please do not include sensitive information in your explanation or any of your answers.”

Users will send back their answers with Yes or No highlighted. “No” Answers will be reviewed and investigated.  

UAT will be considered complete if:
5 or more users send back satisfactory responses. (All questions/ test cases were answered with “Yes”) OR,
We receive any number of satisfactory responses, and failed test cases are investigated and resolved by the Mobile App Team until the affected users can see their data correctly

Since the flow is simple and the primary purpose of this test is to validate production data, the Mobile App Team has determined that the sessions do not need to be facilitated. Users will be provided with a Calendly link to schedule a session if they need guided assistance. 

Tester Steps to Execute
The following visual guide will be included in the instructional email sent to users.
