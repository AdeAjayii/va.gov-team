# External UAT Logistics

Last updated May 20, 2021



## Distribution
We are using Google Play for Android and Test Flight for iOS. We will add participants before sessions via email and set up the app during sessions. Ashley is the designated person to help troubleshoot distribution issues.

## Note taking
We will not be recording, and will take a thorough approach to note taking to document issues and bugs. We will have 2 dedicated note takers per session: 1 person logging each item as pass or fail, and 1 person writing other notes.


## Issue tracking approach 

|  Task 	|  Owners 	|   
|---	|---	|
| Add bugs and issues description & expected behavior to internal Google Sheet 	|  Note takers as point people, all session observers should add bugs/issues they notice. We will aim to do this during/directly after each session. 	| 
| Determine sizing and severity of issues and bugs 	|   Team to complete together in daily end of day syncs from 5/24-27 (scheduled from 4-4:15 ET)	|
