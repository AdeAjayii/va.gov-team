# Overview | VA Mobile App Test Plan v0.1 
A test plan is a documented approach to testing a software product. It is an agreement between the project developers, product managers and quality assurance on the process for testing and verifying the delivery of product functionality. 

The VA Mobile App is a mobile application that will allow veterans to access their healthcare services and claims information via their mobile devices. 

The objective of this Test Plan is to document the process we will use to verify that the software developed for the VA Mobile App works as defined in the product requirements.

## Test Strategy
We are taking an integrated approach to testing - building QA activities into the agile development process so that testing takes place early and often as a key part of sprint operations. Identifying issues during development will minimize technical and functional debt and make for better product quality and more accurate progress reporting and delivery status. In addition, we will leverage automated testing tools in the development delivery chain to provide real time integration and accessibility checks.

## Features to test
Testing will be performed throughout the development process based on the prioritization and delivery of features in the product backlog. As product management prioritizes features and the development team implements those features, Quality Assurance will write associated test cases and execute those test cases, verifying that the features delivered meet the requirements and function as intended. Features that have not been prioritized and implemented will not be tested. For a detailed description of test and acceptance criteria please refer to the product backlog. At a high level, testing will cover the following functionality:
All delivered features related to login and authentication flows including biometric authentication
All delivered features related to navigation and general app behavior
All delivered features related to military information
All delivered features related to direct deposit
All delivered features related to app home screen
All delivered features related to profile and contact information
All delivered features related to letters and documentation
All delivered features related to Veteran crisis line
All delivered features related to notifications including push notifications 
All delivered features related to claims and appeals
All delivered features related to application settings
All delivered features related to appointments
All delivered features related to facility locator
All delivered features related to COVID-19 resources
All delivered features using accessibility controls (see accessibility test plan for more detail)

## Who is responsible
Software quality is a team effort. Developers will be responsible for writing unit tests and building in automated integration tests to the code. The product team will be responsible for acceptance testing of the delivered features. Quality Assurance is responsible for manually testing the product functionality and various user flows through the application.
