## VA Mobile App Discovery


## **Conversation Guide**


## Before the interview starts: validate the participant uses the VA Health and Benefits app and get permission for observers to join.

_When the participant joins:_

Thanks so much for joining. My name is Liz, and before we begin I wanted to confirm that you use the VA Health and Benefits mobile app? Could you get your phone out and describe the app to me? 

_If the participant does not use the mobile app:_

Today’s discussion was about your experience using the app. Since you currently aren’t using it, we can end here for today. I appreciate your time, and apologize for the early end to the session. I’ll reach out to our scheduling partners to have them follow up with you.

_If the participant uses the mobile app:_

Great. Let’s continue on. I have 2-3 people on the team who are interested in listening in to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. If it’s ok by you, I’ll have them join. It’s completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer. 

_(If the participant agrees, let observers join with their video on. Each observer can come off mute and introduce themselves, and then go back on mute with video off._


## Introduction (5 minutes)

I’m here today to talk with you today about your experience using the VA Health and Benefits app. Our discussion will help the team understand how to improve the app for Veterans in the future.

Before we start, there are a few things I'd like to mention:



* We aren’t trying to sell or promote any product or service to you.
* There are no right or wrong answers. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the mobile app and meet the needs of Veterans like yourself.
* I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
* There’s no expectation to provide any personal information around your health situation or medical diagnoses. Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that’s comfortable for you.
* This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt us to move on to the next question.
* We’ll be talking about how you use your mobile phone today. Are you comfortable sharing how you use your phone with us? Because we might access the VA mobile app on your phone, this could use up some of your data. Is this ok by you?
* Is it ok if I record the audio of our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to something you said. The recordings will be destroyed after.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. Any minutes you spend with us are valuable today. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**

Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?

Great! Any questions before we continue?

Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. _Start recording._

Is it ok if we record this session?

## Section 3: VA Health and Benefits Card Game (20 minutes)

Think about your current interactions with the VA to manage your healthcare and benefits. I’m going to share my screen with you now. Take a look at these cards on my screen. Each card has a phrase representing something you might use the VA for.



1. Communicate with my doctors
2. Share health info with people in my life
3. Get connected to other Veterans
4. Get connected to people who can support me
5. Get reminders for things
6. Access my lab and test results
7. Access my health records
8. Manage my prescriptions
9. Manage my VA letters
10. Provide feedback on health visits
11. Make my in-person visits easier
12. Manage my VA payments
13. Manage my VA debt and copay bills
14. Find out about other VA benefits I’m not using 
15. Write your own: blank
16. Write your own: blank

If there’s anything missing, I have some blank cards we can customize. Let me know if you’d want to create a new card - if you tell me what to type, I can make the card for you.

Now, pick out the 5 cards that are most important to you. Tell me which 5 cards to move to the top of the screen.

If you had to arrange the 5 cards in order of things that are most important to you right now, how would you arrange them? Go ahead and tell me, and I’ll put them in order of most important.

Go through and talk to me about each card you chose, and why.

Now consider the reasons why you use the VA Health and Benefits app. I have a few red stickers ready. Imagine you could bring some of these things into the app. Which of these things would you want to see in the app - and why do you think it belongs in an app and not somewhere else?  I’ll place a red circle on those areas.

Tell me more about your choices. Why did you pick these items?_ \
