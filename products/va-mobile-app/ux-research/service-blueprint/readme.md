# Service Blueprint

August 2020

## Background & goals

The Service Blueprint outlines the main features we are delivering in the MVP and the backstage actions, dependencies, and processes powering the Veteran experience.The goal of this is primarily to outline what VA has to do to power the app/provide these service and secondly to outline what unknowns still exist. 

As of August 2020 the Service Blueprint is still a living artifact. As decisions about the MVP feature set are finalized, updated will be made and [reflected here](https://www.figma.com/proto/RqG1G4ClpWbd7a09ZtLoxU/Mobile-App-Service-Blueprint?node-id=4%3A225&scaling=min-zoom). The Service Blueprint is an output of conversations with SMEs, tech discovery, and user interviews. Below is a screenshot of the Service Blueprint as of August 12.

## Outstanding questions

1. What APIs, if any, are available to power non-personalized VA notifications? In user interviews, we learned that general VA notifications would be useful to some Veterans in an app. Veterans would prefer notifications that are still *somewhat* relevant to them (e.g. events at their VAMC, closures or updates in their region or city). Do any APIs exist that can deliver notifications at the VAMC level or region level?
