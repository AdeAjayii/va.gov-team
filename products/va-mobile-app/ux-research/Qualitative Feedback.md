- 10/12/21: "Didn’t know this was a thing. Took 2 minutes to download and login, and I gotta say I like it better than VA.gov" [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/q6m6q4/new_va_health_and_benefits_app/)   
- 10/12/21: "Pros: Veteran Crisis number right there on the home page. Medical Appointments can be seen and even canceled. Can access letters very quickly and easy to send or download to device. Cons: Claims status - can't see very much detail. Claims status - can't upload additional documents. Cannot update direct deposit information."

- 6/29/21: "I don't know whose idea it was to create this app, but I have been waiting for something like this. I love being able to go through an app to get everything I need. I was able to sign in no problem and access all of the menu items no problem. This thing is a gem. It worked flawlessly. I am going to tell everybody and their mother about this bad boy, once the final release is out." - MHV Coordinator, pre-release
- 6/29/21: "As a Veteran, I absolutely love the VA mobile app. I was able to access it after verification of my id.me account. This is going to be groundbreaking for Veterans with smartphones!" - MHV Coordinator, pre-release

## Appointments

- 10/12/21: "Haha thanks. I found out I cancelled my doctor apt today with the app before my hour drive to the VA. Turns out my Doctor decided to cancel it without notifying me." [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/q6m6q4/new_va_health_and_benefits_app/)
