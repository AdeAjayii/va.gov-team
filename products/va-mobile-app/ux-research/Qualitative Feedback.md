## General

- 10/14/21: "I appreciate this! I was looking for something like this for a couple of years now…. Now out of the blue, here it is! Thanks a lot!" [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/q6m6q4/comment/hgg7ria/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
- 10/12/21: "Didn’t know this was a thing. Took 2 minutes to download and login, and I gotta say I like it better than VA.gov" [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/q6m6q4/new_va_health_and_benefits_app/)   
- 10/12/21: "Pros: Veteran Crisis number right there on the home page. Medical Appointments can be seen and even canceled. Can access letters very quickly and easy to send or download to device. Cons: Claims status - can't see very much detail. Claims status - can't upload additional documents. Cannot update direct deposit information."

## Appointments

- 10/12/21: "Haha thanks. I found out I cancelled my doctor apt today with the app before my hour drive to the VA. Turns out my Doctor decided to cancel it without notifying me." [Reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterans/comments/q6m6q4/new_va_health_and_benefits_app/)
