# Appeals Questions:

## Appeals
- What % of claims go to appeals?
- Whatâ€™s the breakdown of appeals by appeal type?
- What are all the different types of appeals? Is this list correct and complete: 
  - Supplemental Review
  - Higher Level Review (HLR)
  - Decision Review Request
- How do appeal types differ in terms of evidence and actions typically required of Vets by VA and decision timeline?

## Additional Evidence 
- Do Vets usually upload additional evidence for their appeals? Or do VSOs usually upload evidence? We are looking to understand how useful a direct upload feature for Vets would be.
- What type of additional evidence is typically requested? We are looking to understand if there are some documents that are most commonly needed.
