# Discussion Guide for Mobile App Prototype Testing

June 2, 2020

## Introduction (5 minutes)
Thank you for joining us today. My name is Bridget and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.
**VA is considering building a mobile app,** and I am working with VA to explore what features should be in a mobile app to best serve and meet the needs of Veterans like you. Today, I’d like to show you a prototype for an app, get your feedback, and do a short interactive exercise. 
Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention:
- Our conversation should take 45 minutes--1 hour.
- In our conversation today, we want to hear your honest opinions. My team’s goal is to improve VA digital tools to better meet the needs of Veterans like you. I will not be offended by any opinions you express - please be as honest as you feel comfortable being with me today.
  - On that note, the prototype we’ll share is just that - a prototype. It’s a blueprint of what an app could look like, nothing is set in stone. 
- Lastly, if it’s alright with you, I would like to record our conversation. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and won’t be used for anything other than internal research purposes. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio?
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Those are all the logistics I wanted to share. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

## Warm Up (5 minutes)
I am going to share a link to a prototype with you in the Zoom chat. Can you please click on the link to open it in your browser, then share your screen with me? I’ll give you a minute to do that.

Ok, great. So while we’re giving that a chance to load, I’d love to want to learn more about you.
- Can you tell me a bit about your background in the military?

Thank you for sharing that. And thank you again for taking time to talk to me today. Today we’re going to look at an app that has features in Claims and Health, plus a few other things like Find a VA Facility and a Profile. 
- Before we start - what is your first reaction to that? 
  - Have you ever used My HealtheVet?
  - Have you ever filed a claim with VA?

Thank you for sharing that. We can go ahead and get started looking at the prototype. I’m going to ask you to go through some flows so we can talk about them, but please feel free to explore the app freely as we’re talking. Again, it’s a prototype, so not everything “works”, but areas that are clickable will flash blue when you click. Please click _Start_ to begin.

## Prioritizing (8 minutes)
Now I’d like to do an exercise in prioritization based on what we’ve talked about so far. Of the things we’ve looked at today, **what is the most important for you to include in a VA mobile app?** Please navigate around the app freely as much as you’d like. 
- What is the #1 most useful to you feature you saw today?
  - Why?
- What is the #2 most useful to you feature you saw today?
  - Why?
- What is the #3 most useful to you feature you saw today?
  - Why? 

## Prioritization wrap up
- Would you download an app that had everything you saw here today?
  - Would you download an app that had just your top 3 features?
- In 1 sentence, can you describe how you feel about what you’ve seen today?
  - Imagine you are talking to a friend who is also a Veteran. What would you say about this app? 
- How would you expect to learn about a VA app like this? 
- How does this compare to how you interact with VA online today?
  - [If user voices it compares positively] Can you describe why this is valuable to you?

## Adding more: build your own app home screen (10 minutes)
Now I’m going to share my screen with you so you get a break from navigating. What I’m sharing here is the home screen to the app that you saw earlier and what you see to the right of that is more ideas for features that could be included in an app. 

I want to do a quick exercise with you to understand what else you would add if you could add more to a VA mobile app. I can drag any feature you'd like to add into the app (demonstrate dragging). Does that make sense?

### Claims
- Starting with Claims, what of these features would you add to a VA mobile app first?
  - Why?
  - (If they feel stuck) If nothing here looks interesting to you, that's ok too - let me know and we'll move on. Or, is there something else that's not shown here you'd like to add? We can do that too! 
- What would you add second?
  - Why?

### Health
- Moving on to Health, what of these features would you add to a VA mobile app first?
  - Why?
  - (If they feel stuck) If nothing here looks interesting to you, that's ok too - let me know and we'll move on. Or, is there something else that's not shown here you'd like to add? We can do that too! 
- What would you add second?
  - Why?
  
### My VA
- Out of what is shown here, what of these features would you add to a VA mobile app first?
  - Why?
  - (If they feel stuck) If nothing here looks interesting to you, that's ok too - let me know and we'll move on. Or, is there something else that's not shown here you'd like to add? We can do that too! 
- What would you add second?
  - Why?

### Exercise Wrap Up 
Let's look at the whole thing you've built. 
  - Let's imagine again you are talking to a friend who is also a Veteran about the app you've built. What would you say about it?
  - How does this compare to how you interact with VA online today?
  - [If user voices it compares positively] Can you describe why this is valuable to you?


## Wrap Up (3 minutes)
That’s all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any last questions for me?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA digital tools and make sure it really works for Veterans like you. Enjoy the rest of your day!
