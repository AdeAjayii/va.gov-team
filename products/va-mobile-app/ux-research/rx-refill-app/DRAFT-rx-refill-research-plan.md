# Research Plan for VA Mobile Team, Rx Refill, 10/13/21
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.*

## Background
The VA Health & Benefits App was released in July and has been slowly rolling out to the Veteran population on the Apple and Google app stores. A common request in pre-release research, and post launch Veteran feedback has been for Rx Refill functionality. We're doing some research to better understand the existing stand alone Rx Refill app and explore how we might expose Rx Refill functionality to Veterans using authenticated mobile apps.

### OCTO Objectives

2. Veterans can manage their health services online
3. Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
5. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
6. Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter?

**Taking care of myself**

## Research Goals
What are you trying to learn from this research?

1. What are the usability wins and challenges of the existing Rx Refill mobile app?

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.*

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

This study is one of three research efforts to build a complete picture of the trade-offs with different approaches to making Rx Refill avaialble to Veterans on mobile devices. This study will give us a clear picture of how Veterans can navigate Rx Refill today.

### Research questions
- What is helpful about using the existing Rx Refill mobile app?

- What is challenging about using the existing Rx Refill mobile app?
- Is it helpful for this to continue to be a distinct application or should this feature be bundled with other related tools?
- What short and medium term steps can we take to improve on the status quo?

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study.
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!



We suspect that the Veterans will have requests to improve the app along a few lines.

- Authentication
- Key features that require tranfer to the MHV website (and authenticating again)
- Accessibility considerations
- General fit and finish (typography, alert and warning presentation, etc.)



## Method
We plan to conduct moderated usability testing with 5–8 Veterans.

We will ask a mix of experienced and (Rx) novice Veterans to walk us through some specific tasks and then follow up with any other ways that they use the app in their lives.



### Location
- Remote Zoom based screen share

## Recruitment

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers.

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources.
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research.
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
We plan to recruit a range of Veterans with mobile devices who have VA medications that they need to manage prescription refills for. We would like to have both experienced and novice users of the VA Rx Refill app. We plan an inclusive recruitment, but we plan to address users of assistive technology in a separate study.

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. [Use the recruitment checker on Microsoft Excel teams](https://governmentcio.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/VSATeam/Shared%20Documents/Accessibility/RecruitmentChecker.xlsx?d=we0ffb06d5bac4cd5902c5f8b23fe988c&csf=1&web=1&e=FzYt5t) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity. *Note: if you are struggling to access the online teams link; you can also [use the recruitment checker on Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) and take a screenshot of your table to share.*
