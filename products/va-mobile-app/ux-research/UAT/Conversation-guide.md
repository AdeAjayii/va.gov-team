### Project-specific setup



1.  Please download the Zoom application to your mobile device.
    * [Apple App Store link to Zoom app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id546505307)
    * [Google Play store link to the Zoom app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings)


### Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today.  \




* How are you today?
* My name is Melissa and I have a few colleagues on the call taking notes and also providing tech support if we run into any issues as we work on signing into the VA mobile app via login.gov. They are going to follow along and may jump in if something doesn't work as expected and need to get some further details. 
* The goal of today is to ensure your data is displaying correctly in the VA health and benefits app.
* In order to get to that point, we will be using the testbuild I had you download to sign up for a login.gov account. 
* We will then have you upgrade to the pro account which is another level of authentication where you will need to take a photo of your ID input your ssn. Once you are signed in, we will have you go through the mobile app and make sure all of your info is showing up how you would expect. 

Any questions so far?

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:



* This entire session should take less than an hour. 
* We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. 
* There are going to be a handful of steps to get through and it can be a lot so if something is confusing feel free to stop me and ask questions. I may or may not know how to help but I have colleagues on the line who might be able to jump in. 
* We want to be sensitive to your privacy and while we will be recording the session to be able to go back and see any tech issues, we will stop the recording while you input your SSN and ID and then resume recording.  
* That being said, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

_Start recording._



* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
    * 

Does this all sound ok so far? Any questions?

A few questions for you:



* What type of device did you use to join this Zoom call today?
    * If not mobile: Can you join from a mobile device?
* Do you have your username and password that you normally use for VA websites handy?
    * If not: Can you access them easily? We will need you to sign in with your own username and password for today’s conversation.
* Are you comfortable signing up for a Login.gov account?
* Do you have a state-issued ID handy?
    * If not: Could you locate that? We’ll need it as part of the login.gov sign up process.

Those are all the logistics. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve tools like this one.

### Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is name. To remind you since this is the second session - the VA has built a mobile app, and today we’d like to test it out with you using login.gov. We're not looking to test you, but test the app wth the new credential. I also want to introduce [ENGINEER], who is one of the engineers on the project. They are going to follow along and may jump in if something doesn't work as expected and need to get some further details. I also have a few other colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:



* This entire session should take less than an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* Please don't feel any pressure to share any personal information you are not comfortable with us viewing.
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
