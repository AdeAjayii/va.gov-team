# Research Plan for Round 1 of Usability Testing of High Fidelity MVP Mobile App

August 20, 2020

# What product & team?
VA Mobile App Team, MVP Mobile App

# Background
In two previous rounds of user research, we have determined that there is a Veteran desire for a VA mobile app and defined an MVP feature set in conjunction with technical discovery efforts. We have designed a high fidelity prototype of the core MVP UX, and we would like to usability test this design with Veterans. This round of research aims to assess the overall effectivness of the MVP high-fi prototype for performing common tasks and identify obstacles to finding certain features. As a secondary goal, we are open to receiving feedback on the overall perception of the app, Veterans' satisfaction with it, and their desire to download it.


# Goals
- Assess Veteran perception of the app and desire to download
- Assess the overall effectivness of the MVP app high-fi prototype for performing common tasks
- Identify obstacles to locating Claims and viewing a claim's information
- Identify obstacles to locating Appointments and viewing upcoming appointment information 
- Identify obstacles to locating and editing Profile and Direct Deposit information
- Identify obstacles to locating VA Letters and Documents
- Identify obstances to locating Settings and signing out of the app 
- Identify obstacles to using the toolbar navigation to navigate the app's features


# Research questions
- What obstacles and usability issues exist within the following areas: 
  - Using the homescreen
  - Locating claims
  - Viewing a specific claim's information
  - Locating appointments
  - Viewing details of an upcoming appointment
  - Locating Profile
  - Editing an email address
  - Locating Direct Deposit
  - Editing information 
  - Locating Letters
  - Downloading a letter
  - Locating Settings
  - Using the bottom toolbar navigation
    - How well do users understand the icons and titles in the bottom toolbar?
    - What is unclear, and why?
- How easily and successfully do users find what they're looking for in the app?
    - Where do users run into problems?
- Overall, how satisfied are Veterans with the MVP feature set and overall app UI/UX design?


# Hypothesis 
- The bottom toolbar navigation elements will be usable and clear to Veterans.
   - "Your VA" might be unclear as a navigation element title.
- Veterans will be able to quickly and successfully find what they're looking for.
- The homescreen design will be usable and clear to Veterans. 
- There may be dissatisfaction with features that are not available in the MVP (e.g. cancelling and scheduling an appointment).
- There may be dissatisfaction with the limited health features.



# Method

## Pre-testing arrangements
We ask for Perigean's help ensuring that all participants have downloaded Zoom onto their mobile device prior to testing. 

## What method of research are you planning?
Remote user interviews with 6-8 of Veterans over the course of 1 week. Each of these interviews will be moderated and conducted remotely using Zoom. The sessions will be led by targeted tasks and flows that lightly cover the prototype overall, but will focus on the areas of: 
1. Homescreen
2. Bottom toolbar navigation
3. Claims
4. Your VA: Profile, Direct Deposit, Letters, Settings

We will test directly on a mobile device using a mobile prototype.

## Why this method?
This method will allow members of the VA Mobile App team, and the teams we are overlapping with, to observe sessions. It will also allow us to speak with a diverse population of Veterans located across the United States. Specifically testing the prototype on a mobile device will allow us to test hit areas.   

## Where are you planning to do your research?
We will use the Perigean zoom account. We will ask participants to join the Zoom via mobile and send a link to the Invision prototype via the Zoom chat for participants to open. Once participants have opened the prototype, we will ask them to share their screen with us.

## What will you be testing?
- Interactive high-fidelity Invision prototype of the MVP VA mobile app (iPhone SE size, 320px width)

## Participants and Recruitment
- We would like to interview 6-8 Veterans. Participant criteria: 
  - All participants must be Veterans
  - All participants must be iOS users, not Android users. They must be using an iOS mobile device for this usability test. 
  - Participant pool should be diverse in:
    - Branch of service
    - Gender 
    - Race
    - Age (ideally at least one participant 25 or under and one participant 65+, but we are flexible)
    - Geography
    - Density (ideally at least one participant in a rural area and one in a major city, but we are flexible)
  - **All** participants should have experience with Disability Benefits and/or filing a claim with VA
    - All participants should be currently going through the claims process for Disability Benefits currently
    - Ideally, 50% recruits should have some experience with VA Health Care benefits in addition to experience with Disability Benefits 
  - All participants should have used VA.gov in the past on mobile and desktop
  - No assistive device users (low-fi prototype does not support assistive technology)

  
## What is your recruitment strategy?
1. Perigean will recruit
2. In order to get 6-8 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 10 participants total, with the expectation that there be a max of 4 no-shows.

## When?
1. Timeline for this study: Week of September 7 (depending on recruitment)
2. Length of Sessions: Schedule for 1 hour (plan to go for 45 minutes)
3. Availability: Tuesday-Friday (11 AM EST – 6 PM EST). Please don’t schedule back to back sessions if possible. 
4. Prepare: We will conduct a pilot interview the week of August 31.
