# Research Plan for Round 1 of Usability Testing of High Fidelity MVP Mobile App

August 20, 2020

# What product & team?
VA Mobile App Team, MVP Mobile App

# Background
In two previous rounds of user research, we have determined that there is a Veteran desire for a VA mobile app and defined an MVP feature set in conjunction with technical discovery efforts. We have designed a high fidelity prototype of the core MVP UX, and we would like to usability test this design with Veterans. This round of research aims to assess the overall effectivness of the MVP high-fi prototype for performing common tasks and identify obstacles to finding certain features. As a secondary goal, we are open to receiving feedback on the overall perception of the app, Veterans' satisfaction with it, and their desire to download it.


# Goals
- **Assess Veteran perception of biometric sign in**
  - Determine how useful biometric sign in would be to Veterans in a VA app
- **Assess the effectiveness and clarity of the app IA and navigation UI**
  - Identify obstacles to locating Claims and viewing a claim's information
  - Identify obstacles to locating Appointments and viewing upcoming appointment information 
  - Identify obstacles to locating Profile and Direct Deposit information
  - Identify obstacles to locating VA Letters and Documents
  - Identify obstances to locating Settings 
  - Identify obstances to locating Facility Locator
  - Identify obstacles to using the toolbar navigation to navigate the app's features
  - Identify obstacles to using home screen cards and list items to navigate the app's features
  - Identify obstacles to using iOS segmented contols to navigate within Claims and Appointments
- **Assess Veteran perception of the MVP app overall**
  - Determine if participants are satisfied or unsatisfied with MVP app features


# Research questions
- How do Veterans express the value of biometric sign in to them?
- What patterns and obstacles exist within the following areas: 
  - Homescreen
  - Locating claims
  - Viewing a specific claim's information
  - Locating appointments
  - Viewing details of an upcoming appointment
  - Locating Facility Locator
  - Locating COVID-19 News
  - Locating Profile
  - Locating Direct Deposit
  - Locating Letters
  - Locating App Settings
  - Using the bottom toolbar navigation
    - How well do users understand the icons and titles in the bottom toolbar?
    - What is unclear, and why?
  - Using the in-page cards and list items on the home screen
    - How well do users understand the cards and list items?
    - What is unclear, and why?
- How easily and successfully do users find what they're looking for in the app?
    - Where do users run into problems?
- Overall, how satisfied are Veterans with the MVP feature set and overall app UI/UX design?


# Hypothesis 
- The bottom toolbar navigation elements will mostly be usable and clear to Veterans
   - "Your VA" might be unclear, or users might not expect to find Facility Locator and COVID-19 News there
- When prompted to find App Settings, users will navigate to "Your VA" and be able to locate Settings on that screen
- Veterans will be able to quickly and successfully find what they're looking for
- Veterans will use homescreen cards and list items to navigate from the homescreen more than the bottom toolbar
- There may be dissatisfaction with features that are not available in the MVP (e.g. cancelling and scheduling an appointment)
- There may be dissatisfaction with the limited health features



# Method

## What method of research are you planning?
Remote user interviews with 6-8 of Veterans over the course of 1 week. Each of these interviews will be moderated and conducted remotely using Zoom. The sessions will be led by targeted tasks that lightly cover the prototype overall with the purpose of testing the IA and Navigation UI. We will test a mobile prototype on desktop.

## Why this method?
This method will allow members of the VA Mobile App team, and the teams we are overlapping with, to observe sessions. It will also allow us to speak with a diverse population of Veterans located across the United States.   

## Where are you planning to do your research?
We will use the Perigean zoom account. We will send a link to the Invision prototype via the Zoom chat for participants to open. Once participants have opened the prototype, we will ask them to share their screen with us.

## What will you be testing?
- Interactive high-fidelity Invision prototype of the MVP VA mobile app (iPhone SE size, 320px width)

## Participants and Recruitment
- We would like to interview 6-8 Veterans. Participant criteria: 
  - All participants must be Veterans
  - Participant pool should be diverse in:
    - Branch of service
    - Gender 
    - Race
    - Age (ideally at least one participant 25 or under and one participant 65+, but we are flexible)
    - Geography
    - Density (ideally at least one participant in a rural area and one in a major city, but we are flexible)
  - **All** participants be currently going through the claims process for Disability Benefits.
    - Ideally, 50% recruits should have some experience with VA Health Care benefits as well
  - All participants should have used VA.gov in the past
  - No assistive device users (low-fi prototype does not support assistive technology)

  
## What is your recruitment strategy?
1. Perigean will recruit
2. In order to get 6-8 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 10 participants total, with the expectation that there be a max of 4 no-shows.

## When?
1. Timeline for this study: Week of September 7 (depending on recruitment)
2. Length of Sessions: Schedule for 1 hour (plan to go for 45 minutes)
3. Availability: Tuesday-Friday (11 AM EST – 6 PM EST). Please don’t schedule back to back sessions if possible. 
4. Prepare: We will conduct a pilot interview the week of August 31.
