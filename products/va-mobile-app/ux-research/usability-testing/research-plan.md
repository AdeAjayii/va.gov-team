# Research Plan for Usability Testing of High Fidelity MVP Mobile App

August 13, 2020

# What product & team?
VA Mobile App Team, MVP Mobile App

# Background
In two previous rounds of user research, we have determined that there is a Veteran desire for a VA mobile app and defined an MVP feature set in conjunction with technical discovery efforts. We have designed a high fidelity prototype of the core MVP UX, and we would like to usability test this design with Veterans. This round of research mainly aims to validate or challenge the usability of the MVP app design (~80%) and as a secondary goal (~20%) garner reactions to features included so help us tweak our MVP feature set.

# Research questions
- What usability issues exist with our proposed MVP design?
  - What is confusing or unclear?
  - What tasks are difficult to complete?
  - What UX/UI edits should we make to improve usability?
- What are the main user flows Veterans might take through the app?
- What is *not* included here in the MVP that Veterans want?


# Hypothesis 
- Veterans will respond positively to the app features and overall UI design.
- The bottom toolbar navigation elements will be usable and clear to Veterans.
- The use of iOS platform elements will help the app be more usable because it's leveraging established mobile patterns.
- There may be dissatisfaction with features that are not available in the MVP (e.g. cancelling and scheduling an appointment). 
- There may be confusion or dissatisfaction with the limited health features. 


# Method

## What method of research are you planning?
Remote user interviews with 6-8 of Veterans over the course of 1 week. Each of these interviews will be moderated and conducted remotely using Zoom. The sessions will be led by targeted tasks and flows that cover the core UX features of the interactive prototype. Ideally we will test the prototype directly on mobile devices (still thinking through process for this).

## Why this method?
This method will allow members of the VA Mobile App team, and the teams we are overlapping with, to observe sessions. It will also allow us to speak with a diverse population of Veterans located across the United States. Specifically testing the prototype on a mobile device will help us test sizing of UI elements, typography, and hit areas, allowing us to get a clearer sense of UX/UI improvements needed to make the MVP app as user friendly as possible.     

## Where are you planning to do your research?
We will use the Perigean zoom account. We will ask participants to join the Zoom via mobile and send a link to the Invision prototype there (still thinking through process for this). As a backup, we can conduct interviews on desktop with the prototype pulled up on desktop and navigate it with a mouse.

## What will you be testing?
- Interactive high-fidelity Invision prototype (iPhone SE size, 320px width)

## Participants and Recruitment
- We would like to interview 6-8 Veterans. Participant criteria: 
  - All participants must be Veterans.
  - Participant pool should be diverse in:
    - Branch of service
    - Gender (30% or more women)
    - Race
    - Age (ideally two people each from 18-30, 31-50, 50-64, 65+, but can be flexible)
    - Geography
    - Density (rural)
  - **All** participants should have experience with Disability Benefits and/or filing a claim with VA. 
    - A majority of recruits should be going through the claims process for Disability Benefits currently. 
    - Ideally, 50% of recruits should have some experience with VA Health Care benefits in addition to experience with Disability Benefits. 
  - All participants should have used VA.gov in the past 
  - No assistive device users (low-fi prototype does not support assistive technology)
  - No more than 30% of participants should be VA employees

  
## What is your recruitment strategy?
1. Perigean will recruit
2. In order to get 6-8 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 10 participants total, with the expectation that there be a max of 4 no-shows.

## When?
1. Timeline for this study: Week of August 31 - September 4 (depending on recruitment)
2. Length of Sessions: Schedule for 1 hour (plan to go for 45 minutes)
3. Availability: Monday-Friday (11 AM EST – 6 PM EST). Please don’t schedule back to back sessions if possible. 
4. Prepare: We will conduct a pilot interview the week of August 24.
