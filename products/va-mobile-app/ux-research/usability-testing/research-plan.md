# Research Plan for Usability Testing of High Fidelity MVP Mobile App

August 20, 2020

# What product & team?
VA Mobile App Team, MVP Mobile App

# Background
In two previous rounds of user research, we have determined that there is a Veteran desire for a VA mobile app and defined an MVP feature set in conjunction with technical discovery efforts. We have designed a high fidelity prototype of the core MVP UX, and we would like to usability test this design with Veterans. This round of research mainly aims to validate or challenge the usability of the MVP app design (~80%) and as a secondary goal (~20%) garner reactions to features included so help us tweak our MVP feature set.


# Research questions
- How satisfied are Veterans with the MVP feature set and overall app UI/UX design?
- What usability issues exist specifically within the following 3 areas: 
  - Authentication 
  - Navigation
  - My VA (Profile, Direct deposit, Letters) 
- What is confusing or unclear about these 3 areas?


# Hypothesis 
- Veterans will respond positively to the app features and overall UI design.
- The bottom toolbar navigation elements will be usable and clear to Veterans.
  - - "Your VA" might be a confusing navigation title.
- There may be dissatisfaction with features that are not available in the MVP (e.g. cancelling and scheduling an appointment).
- There may be dissatisfaction with the limited health features.



# Method

## What method of research are you planning?
Remote user interviews with 6-8 of Veterans over the course of 1 week. Each of these interviews will be moderated and conducted remotely using Zoom. The sessions will be led by targeted tasks and flows that lightly cover the prototype overall, but will focus on the 3 areas of Authentication, Navigation, and My VA. We will test a prototype of an iPhone SE within a desktop browser. 

## Why this method?
This method will allow members of the VA Mobile App team, and the teams we are overlapping with, to observe sessions. It will also allow us to speak with a diverse population of Veterans located across the United States. Specifically testing the prototype on desktop rather than on mobile devices will allow us to learn most quickly about what is and isn't working before investing in cross-platform prototypes and prototypes built for devices with unique safe areas.   

## Where are you planning to do your research?
We will use the Perigean zoom account. We will ask participants to join the Zoom via mobile and send a link to the Invision prototype via the Zoom chat for participants to open. Once participants have opened the prototype, we will ask them to share their screen with us.

## What will you be testing?
- Interactive high-fidelity Invision prototype of the MVP VA mobile app (iPhone SE size, 320px width)

## Participants and Recruitment
- We would like to interview 6-8 Veterans. Participant criteria: 
  - All participants must be Veterans
  - Participant pool should be diverse in:
    - Branch of service
    - Gender 
    - Race
    - Age (ideally at least one participant 25 or under and one participant 65+, but we are flexible)
    - Geography
    - Density (ideally at least one participant in a rural area and one in a major city, but we are flexible)
  - **All** participants should have experience with Disability Benefits and/or filing a claim with VA
    - A majority of participants should be currently going through the claims process for Disability Benefits currently
    - Ideally, 75% recruits should have some experience with VA Health Care benefits in addition to experience with Disability Benefits 
  - All participants should have used VA.gov in the past on mobile and desktop
  - No assistive device users (low-fi prototype does not support assistive technology)

  
## What is your recruitment strategy?
1. Perigean will recruit
2. In order to get 6-8 participants, we would like Perigean to schedule 10 participants total, with the expectation that there be a max of 4 no-shows.

## When?
1. Timeline for this study: Week of August 31 - September 4 (depending on recruitment)
2. Length of Sessions: Schedule for 1 hour (plan to go for 45 minutes)
3. Availability: Monday-Friday (11 AM EST – 6 PM EST). Please don’t schedule back to back sessions if possible. 
4. Prepare: We will conduct a pilot interview the week of August 24.
