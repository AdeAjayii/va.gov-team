# Discussion Guide for Mobile App MVP Testing R2

January 2021

## Introduction & Logistics (10 minutes)
Thank you for joining us today. My name is Bridget and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. The VA has built a mobile app. I am working with the VA to make the app easy to use so it will best meet the needs of Veterans like you. 

- Right now, we are working on building the app. We're still in the midst of working on the project, so what you'll see today is a prototype. There will be things that might not look right, are broken, or are not working yet, and one of our goals in speaking with you today is to understand what isn't working and what we need to improve.  
- Since our app is still in progress, it's not yet in the app store where you might typically download a mobile app. So to share the app with you today, I will send you a file here on Zoom, and ask you to manually install the app directly onto your phone. I don't expect that you have done this before, and I can walk you through each step together via screen share to get the app up and running.  

Do you have any questions so far?

- Once the app is up and running on your phone, I will ask you to sign in using your own DS Logon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me username and password. Set up of the app and sign will probaby take awhile, and I expect set up and sign in to take most of our time, and I appreciate your patience working through these things with me in advance. 
- If at any point we are hitting road blocks during the set up and sign in process, I have the app on my phone, and we can look at it from my phone together.

Does this all sound ok so far?


Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention:
- Our conversation should take a little under an hour.
- I will not be offended by any opinions you express - please be as honest as you feel comfortable being. My goal is to help VA build the most useful, usable mobile app we can, I want to hear any feedback you have.
- Since you will be signing into your own VA account some of your VA appointment, claims and appeal, and profile information will be shared. I understand that there may be certain things that you do not want to share with us. If there is something you would rather not share let me know and we can skip it.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. This is a voluntary session, and you will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- Lastly, I would like to record our conversation. Again, since you will be signing into your own VA account and some information will be shared via screen share, I want to make sure you are comfortable with both the screen and audio being recorded. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately & we delete them after we complete the analysis. Is it ok with you if I record our session today?
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Those are all the logistics. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

## Tech Set Up (10 minutes)
#### Step 1 - Device Check
First, I’d like to know how you joined the meeting today. What device are you using?
- If mobile: Go to step 2.
- If desktop or tablet: Do you have access to your mobile device, and can you join the Zoom meeting from there instead? 

#### Step 2 - Start screen share
Now I’m going to ask you to start sharing your screen with me via Zoom. When you are inside the Zoom app on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom of the screen. In the middle, there should be a big green button labeled Share Content. Do you see it? I'd like you to share your screen with me! I can walk you through what to do. If you see any additional prompts different than what I am describing, please read them aloud and I will help: 
Tap on the arrow that says "Share".
- A menu should come up with options of what to share - please hit "Screen".
- You should be prompted with an option to select what you'd like to share - please select "Zoom". You may see a message asking if you'd like to start recording or casting with Zoom. If you are comfortable with your screen being recorded, please hit "Start now". 
- Do you see a message asking if you would like to allow Zoom to display over other apps?
  - If yes, please select "Allow Zoom to display over other apps"
- The next thing you should see is a button for "Start Broadcast".
- Ok, tap anywhere on the screen to go back to the Zoom application.

Great, now I can see your phone screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out with me so we can look at the VA app together today. 

#### Step 3 - Set up prototype app on Android
Now we're going to install the VA mobile app on your phone. It takes a few steps. I'm going to send you a link to a file in the Zoom chat will install the app. Does that sound ok to you? 

- Good. Down at the bottom of Zoom you should see a speech bubble with the word Participants and a red number 1. Tap on that to open the chat.
- Great. Tap on the "Download" button to download the file.
- Once the file has downloaded to your phone (this might take a few minutes), open it and select Install. 
- You may need to change your phone’s security settings to allow the app to successfully install. Turn on Allow from this source to allow installation. I also want to note that this is not something we would normally recommend you do. But because we're doing a guided walkthrough with you and will uninstall the app at the end you can trust this process and that it is necessary. If you don't want to change your settings for this app I understand and that is ok. 
- Now it's installed. You should see it where you access your phone's apps. It will be labeled VA Mobile with an Android icon.

Great. Thank you for bearing with me on getting everything up and running. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm Up (5 minutes)
Before we dive into the app, I’d love to want to learn more about you.
- What branch of the military did you serve in and when?
- How do you manage your VA benefits - for example, calling, websites, going into VA locations, etc?

Thank you for sharing that, I think we’re ready to get started. Can you navigate to the VA app?

## Sign in (10 minutes)
Next, I am going to ask you to process with signing into the VA mobile app using your own username and password. When we get to the point where you need to enter your password, I will ask you to stop the screen share to protect your privacy. Are you comfortable sharing your screen until we get to that point? 

Thank you.
