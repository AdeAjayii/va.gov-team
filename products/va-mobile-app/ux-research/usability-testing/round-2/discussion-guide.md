# Discussion Guide for Mobile App MVP Testing R2

January 2021

## Introduction & Logistics (5 minutes)
Thank you for joining us today. My name is Bridget and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. The VA has built a mobile app. I am working with the VA to make the app easy to use so it will best meet the needs of Veterans like you. Today, I’d like to share the app with you and see what you think about it. To do that, I will ask you to sign into the app using your own DS Logon, My HealtheVet, or ID.me username and password. You will also need access to your email on your phone.
Do you have any questions so far?

Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention:
- Our conversation should take a little under an hour.
- I will not be offended by any opinions you express - please be as honest as you feel comfortable being. My goal is to help VA build the most useful, usable mobile app we can, I want to hear any feedback you have.
- Since you will be signing into your own VA account some of your VA appointment, claims and appeal, and profile information will be shared. I understand that there may be certain things that you do not want to share with us. If there is something you would rather not share let me know and we can skip it.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. This is a voluntary session, and you will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- Lastly, I would like to record our conversation. Again, since you will be signing into your own VA account and some information will be shared via screen share, I want to make sure you are comfortable with both the screen and audio being recorded. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately & we delete them after we complete the analysis. Is it ok with you if I record our session today?
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Those are all the logistics. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

## Tech Set Up (10 minutes)
#### Step 1 - Device Check
First, I’d like to know how you joined the meeting today. What device are you using?
- If mobile: Go to step 2.
- If desktop or tablet: Do you have access to your mobile device, and can you join the Zoom meeting from there instead? 

#### Step 2 - Start screen share
Now I’m going to ask you to start sharing your screen with me via Zoom. When you are inside the Zoom app on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom of the screen. In the middle, there should be a big green button labeled Share Content. Do you see it? I'd like you to share your screen with me! I can walk you through what to do:
Tap on the arrow that says "Share content". 
- A menu should come up with options of what to share - please hit "Screen".
- You should be prompted with an option to select what you'd like to share - please select "Zoom" and then "Screen". Then select "Start Broadcast".
- If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.
- Ok, tap anywhere on the screen to go back to the Zoom application.

Great, now I can see your phone screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out with me so we can look at the VA app together today. 

#### Step 3 - Set up prototype app 
Ok, do you have access to your email on your phone? 

- If no: No problem. So I think what will be the easiest is for me to show you the app on my screen and get your feedback that way. Why don't you stop sharing and I will do the sharing. (Share demo and [go to Warm Up](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/usability-testing/round-2/discussion-guide.md#warm-up-5-minutes)).

- If yes: Follow instructions below. If participant gets stuck or frustrated offer to show them demo and discontinue set up.

##### Android App Setup:
Great. It takes a few steps. What we're going to do is check your email for an invite, download a file, and then install the VA Mobile app. Does that sound ok to you? 

- Let's check your email. You should have an email from [placeholder]. There will be a link to a Google Drive folder. In that folder will be an .APK file. That file is the VA mobile app that can be downloaded locally onto your phone. 
- Go ahead and open the APK app file in Google Drive and tap Download. 
- Good. The file will be too big for virus scanning, but tap Download anyway.
- Once the file has downloaded to your phone (this might take a few minutes), open it and select Install. 
- You may need to change your phone’s security settings to allow the app to successfully install. Turn on Allow from this source to allow installation. If that's not something you are comfortable with I understand.
- Now it's installed. You should see it on your phone's home screen labeled VA Mobile with an Android icon.

Great. Thank you for bearing with me on getting everything up and running. It's a lot more steps to install a demo app, and so I am glad you stuck with me on all of them. Now we're really ready to begin!

## Warm Up (5 minutes)
Before we dive into the app, I’d love to want to learn more about you.

## Sign in (10 minutes)
