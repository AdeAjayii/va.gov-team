# Usability Testing Plan

August 2020 

Throughout the development of the VA MVP mobile app, we will conduct at least 4 usability testing sessions with Veterans using an Invision prototype. All testing will focus lightly on the MVP app overall, and dive deep into different features: 

| Round      | Focus Areas |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| 1   | Claims and Appeals, Homescreen, Navigation, My VA (Profile, Direct Deposit, Letters), Settings      |
| 2   | Authentication     |
| 3   | Veterans Crisis Line, Appointments, Facility Locator, [re-testing of features if needed]     |
| 4   | Claims and Appeals, Notifications, [re-testing of features if needed]     |

In addition to conducting testing using an Invision prototype, we hope to test the app itself along the way as we release features.
