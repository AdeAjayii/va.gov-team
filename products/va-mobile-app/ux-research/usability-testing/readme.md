# MVP Mobile App User Research Plan

## Purpose
To date, the VA Mobile App team has conducted three disocvery studies with VA users and one usability test using various UX prototypes. Going forward, we will test only the working app prototype.  

Using the feedback that we get from users, we also recommend evaluating the technical and organizational feasibility of the features. This will help steer the overall direction of the product and ensure decisions about feature priortization are contextualized within the known constraints (eg, a VFS team is working on this feature for VA.gov today). 

Below we summarize our proposed approach to both **Usability Testing** and **Product Planning Research.**  

Last updated December 4, 2020 

## Usability Testing
**Goal:** evaluate the usability of the MVP app, identify barriers to using it

## September 9-11, 2020: MVP App Usability Testing R1
In September we tested the high-fi prototype of the MVP mobile app. Our research goals were:
- Assess the effectiveness and clarity of the app IA and navigation UI
- Assess the desired content on Profile, Direct Deposit, Letters and Documents, and Settings
- Assess the home screen design
- Assess the desired content on the mobile app Claim Status Tool
- Assess Veteran perception of the MVP app overall

In R1, we used the final 10 minutes of each session to allow the participant to freely explore the app. Between this portion of the interview and the task-based testing, we were able to garner feedback on all the app's features since the MVP is quite small.

## October and November 2020
Between now and late November (9 weeks) we have focused on the following: 
- Develop the UI/UX for each screen, guided by R1 feedback 
- Define accessibility criteria for each screen
- Build screens
- QA, continuous delivery into Test Flight
- Share with 508 Office along the way for their accessibility input and feedback

## Plan for January 2021 Research 
After delivering the MVP into Test Flight (~late Dec 2020), we will test the app with Veterans that we recruit with Perigean using the VSP research cycle. With this research, we seek to 1) identify major usability issues with sign in and general navigation & usability of the breadth of features and 2) get a sense of overall Veteran satisfaction with the app. Research questions include: 
- What major usability issues exist with sign in to the app?
- What obstacles exist in the user navigating the app as a whole, using the bottom toolbar and top navigation bar? 
- What major usability obstacles to locating and editing personal & contact information?
- (If user has data) What obstacles exist to locating information about an appointment?
- (If user has data) Do participants find anything confusing/unclear about appointments?
- (If user has data) What obstacles exist to locating information about a specific claim or appeal? 
- (If user has data) Do participants find anything confusing/unclear about claims & appeals?
- What would participants expect this app to be called?
- What do participants feel is missing? Why?


#### Assumptions and unknowns 
- We do not yet have a launch date for the app store, but that date will likely be sometime early-mid 2021. 
- We will have time between the MVP soft internal launch and the app store launch to do testing with Veterans in Test Flight and act on user feedback (likely December-February).

## Product Planning Research
**Goal:** Contextualize Veteran desirability within the known technical and business constraints.

### March-July 2020: discovery research
In addition to September usability testing, we have done 3 additional rounds of discovery research with Veterans that we can lean on to identity post-MVP features on our roadmap:
- [March 2020 discovery sprint](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/discovery-sprint/veteran-desirability/usability-testing/VA%20Mobile%20App%20Discovery_%20Usability%20test%20report.pdf)
- [May 2020 discovery sprint](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/user-interviews/research-summary.md)
- [June 2020 prototype testing + co-design research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/prototype-testing/testing-summary.md)

### October and November: what's next?
The approach we plan to take in the short-term is:  
- Add tickets to ZenHub (va-mobile-app) identifying features that have high Veteran desirability using March-July research as our guide.
- Tag features as 'fast-follow' or 'post-mvp' depending on our initial estimate of their overall feasibility
- Groom 'fast-follow' tickets with our DEPO stakeholders
- Be ready to build them post-November; possiblty integrate some 'fast-follow' tickets in our MVP delivery

### Post-November: what's next?
- Build out roadmap
- Revisit overarching VA mobile strategy in collaboration with other teams if needed; strategic planning
