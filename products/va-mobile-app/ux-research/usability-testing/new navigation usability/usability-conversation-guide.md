# Conversation Guide for VA Mobile App Information Architecture & Navigation: Evaluative Research - Usability Study

## Moderator logistics
### 2-3 days before the session:
- Review VA Platform's [Research Checklist](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Checklist.1958773011.html#ResearchChecklist-5.Conductsessions). 
- Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study
### Day of the session:
- Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in 
Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).
### Starting the session:
- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Prorejct Project-Specific Setup
Participants should have the Zoom application downloaded on their phone
* [Apple App Store Zoom app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id546505307)
* [Google Play store link to the Zoom app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=us.zoom.videomeetings)

### When the participant joins:
Validate the participant uses the VA Health and Benefits app and get permission for observers to join.

- Thanks so much for joining today. My name is Holly, very nice to meet you. Today we're going to talk about the VA mobile app. Our discussion will help the team understand how to improve the app for Veterans in the future. 
- Before we begin: I have a few people on the team who are interested in listening in to our session as observers. They’re in the virtual waiting room right now. It’s completely fine if you choose to have the session without observers, so let me know what you’d prefer. If it’s ok by you, I’ll have them join. 

*(If the participant agrees, let observers join with their video on. Each observer should come off mute and introduce themselves, and then go back on mute with video off.)*

## Introduction (5 minutes)
* There are a few things I'd like to mention:
  * There are no right or wrong answers, and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express. We just want to hear your opinions, so that we can improve the mobile app and make it work better for everyone.
  * There’s no expectation to provide any personal information. Please feel free to share your thoughts and experiences at the level that’s comfortable for you.
  * This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
  * We’ll talk together in the beginning, and then we will move to a part where I’ll ask you to open a prototype on your mobile phone and share your phone screen with us. The prototype is a simulation of how we think the mobile app will work in the future. Since it's a simulation and we didn't build it yet, you'll notice that some of the parts work, and some don't. When we get to this part, you can interact with it the same way you'd interact with any other app, and I'll direct us if we run into any areas that don't work. Since it's a simulation, none of the information is real and none of it will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
  * Finally, is it ok if I record the audio of our session today? Our team will use this as backup in case we need to refer to something you said. The recordings will be destroyed after.
  * **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. Any minutes you spend with us are valuable today. You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop. Just let me know at any point if you’re uncomfortable continuing, and we will end.**
  * Does that all make sense, and sound okay to you?
  * Great! Any questions before we continue?
  * Ok, I'm going to hit the record button now. 

*Start recording.*

  * Is it ok if we record this session?

## Section 1: Warm-Up Questions (5 minutes)
* Before we look at the app, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
* What VA services do you use?
  * How do you typically access those services? Website, phone call, something else?
* Do you have the VA Health and Benefits mobile app?
  * *If yes:*
    * When did you first start using it?
    * What are the main reasons you use it?
    * How frequently do you go into the app? Daily? Weekly? Monthly?
    * What do you like best? What do you wish you could change?
  * *If no:* Move to next question
* Ok, thank you for that.

## Section 2: Prototype setup & screenshare (5 minutes)
* Now we’re going to move on to the prototype part of our conversation. During our session today, I am going to have you imagine a series of situations and I’d like you to use the app to work through them.
* First, I’d like to ask you to share your phone screen so I can help you install the app and we can look at it together. I can walk you through how to start the screen share.
* *[Help participant share screen]*
  * [iOS: Zoom screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/iphone-start-screen-share)
  * [Android: Zoom screen share](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/android-start-screen-share)
* Great, I’m seeing your screen. Now I’m going to help you get the app ready.
* I am going to send you a link to the app we will be using in the session in the Zoom chat. Please go ahead and tap on the link to open it on your phone. 
 * Prototype ([Android](https://figma.fun/O2AJVI/view)) ([iOS](https://figma.fun/O2AJVI/))
* Ok, just a couple more things to set it up.
  * *If iOS:*
    * Once you have the app open in your browser, in the top bar, where the website name (figma.com) is, tap on the two AAs on the far left side. It should open a menu. 
    * In that menu, tap “Hide Toolbar” to hide the top and bottom bars. I will help you turn it back on at the end of the session.
  * *If Android:*
    * Once you have the app open in your browser, you should see a link at the bottom of the screen that says “View in full-screen.” Tap on that link. I will help you get out of full-screen at the end of the session.
* *If participant is unable to screenshare and/or get the prototype to work on their phone: Use prototype (and screen share) on desktop/laptop instead.* 


## Section 3: Usability tasks (25 min)

    * Tap on the time at the top of your screen to unhide your toolbar. 
    * Now tap the picture of the two boxes in the bottom right corner. Tap the x in the top corner of the box showing the picture of the prototype.

    * There is a bar at the bottom of the screen that says “Mobile app.. edited” with a lock icon. Tap on that to unhide your toolbar.
