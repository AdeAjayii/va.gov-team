# Discussion Guide for Mobile App MVP Usability Testing R1

August 31, 2020

# Introduction (5 minutes)
Thank you for joining us today. My name is Bridget and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.

The VA is building a mobile app. I am working with VA to ensure the app is easy to use and clear so it will best serve and meet the needs of Veterans like yourself. Today, I’d like to share with you a prototype of the mobile app, and see what you think about it. 
- First, I’d like to ask you to complete some tasks for me within the app so we can learn how we can improve the app's design. In doing this, I'll ask you to navigate to some specific screens and read them, and tell me what you think.    
- Then, I’d like to give you control over where we go, and talk more generally about how you feel about what you see in the app -- what you’re excited about, what you think is missing, etc. 

Sound good? 

Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention:
- Our conversation should take ~45-50 minutes. 
- My goal is to help VA build a clear, usable app. I will not be offended by any opinions you express - please be as honest as you feel comfortable being.
- Lastly, if it’s alright with you, I would like to record our conversation. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately & we delete them after we complete analysis. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio?
  - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Those are all the logistics. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?

# Warm up (5 minutes)
First I’d love to want to learn more about yourself and your experience with VA. 
- What branch of the military did you serve in and when was your period or periods of service?
- What type of phone do you use?
  - Do you use your phone to manage your VA benefits? If so, how often?
- You indicated you are currently going through the claims process with VA - is that right?
  - Can you tell me about the last time you used eBenefits or VA.gov to file, check up on, or otherwise manage your claim?
  - Was it on desktop, tablet, or mobile?
- Do you use VA health care?

Thank you for sharing all that.

# Biometric sign in and homescreen (5 minutes)
Please open the VA mobile app from the homescreen of this prototype and sign in. 

**Things to watch for**
- Does the participant react openly to biometric sign in? Is the reaction positive or negative?

Now that you are signed in, I’m going to ask you to spend a minute looking at the home screen of your app. Please don’t click, but you can scroll.
- What questions do you have about what you see here?

I’m going to ask you to do some things for me in the app. I’m not testing you or your ability, but the prototype! We want to understand if anything isn't clear so we can make it better.

# Free exploration (8 minutes)
Thank you for letting me ask you to get around the app! Now you're in charge. Feel free to click around the app - anywhere you'd like to go. As you're exploring, I'm here to answer any questions you have. I'd also love to hear what you think if you're comfortable talking out loud as you explore.

I'd like to learn from you a bit about how you feel about everything we've talked about today. 
- Do you think this mobile app would be useful to you? Why or why not?

That’s all the questions I have for you today. Do you have any last questions for me?

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA’s mobile app and make sure it really works for Veterans like you. Enjoy the rest of your day!
