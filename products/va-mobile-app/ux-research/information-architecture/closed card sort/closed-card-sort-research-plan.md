# Research Plan for VA Mobile App Information Architecture Research: Closed Card Sort (part 2 of 3)

This work falls within the first phase of a three-phase project. For a summary of the entire project, see [VA Mobile App User Research: Information Architecture & Navigation - High Level Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/High%20Level%20Project%20Summary.md). 


## Background

The VA Mobile app was designed to allow Veterans to more easily complete key transactions across VA Health and Benefits services. 

As the app grows in its feature set, the VA Mobile App team needs a better understanding of how Veterans would navigate benefits and health services within the mobile app. We want to ensure the structure and organization of the app makes sense and can accommodate the new features we have identified as of interest on our roadmap.

### Project Objectives & Goals 


#### OCTO-DE Objectives

The following are the [OCTO-DE objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports.


1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services


#### OCTO-DE Goals

The following are the [OCTO-DE goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports.


1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features


#### Veteran Journey


* Primary point in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf): “Taking care of myself”
* Secondary points: “Reinventing myself, “Putting down roots,” and “Retiring”


### Previous User Research

* An Open Card sort study [Research Plan for VA Mobile App Information Architecture Research: Open Card Sort (part 1 of 3)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/Card-Sort-Research-Plan.md) was conducted in October 2021.



## Research Goals


### Information Architecture Research

Fulfills issue ##

The purpose of this work is to inform the information architecture, content and design of the VA Mobile app in order to deliver a solution that is usable, useful, and extensible, before we scale the app to a larger audience. See [VA Mobile App User Research: Information Architecture & Navigation - High Level Summary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NIiJDk0_2RsgnwyjTTERp9bykURZ7CMhFZ-j1OXJg28/edit#) for a high level summary of the entire 3-phase process.

Our **goal** in this study **(**Phase I - IA Research - Pt 2 - Closed Card Sort**) is to understand how users think about the current and possible future content in the VA mobile app based on a group of 35 cards, including:

* **Understanding how participants would group and name** the current and proposed VA Mobile App content.


### Outcome

This research will allow us to adjust the information architecture in the app to accommodate future features before we scale the app to a larger audience. This is important as it will allow us to easily add those future features without having to make Veterans learn new navigation paths as the app grows.


### Research Questions



1. How do veterans think about the current and proposed pieces of content on the VA Mobile app?
    1. Do veterans understand the proposed categories?
    2. Are there any cards that veterans felt uncertain about what category to place them in? 
    3. Are there any categories missing?


### Hypotheses 


1. Veterans will be able to categorize cards and name groups of cards presented in the card sort.
2. Veterans will categorize cards and name groups in a similar manner to how they are organized on VA.gov.
3. Veterans will categorize cards representing common mobile app actions in a way that’s consistent with other apps in the wild (ex: Profile, Settings)



## Methods + Tools


### Closed Card Sort (remote, unmoderated)


#### What it is

In a closed card sort, participants are asked to sort topics from content within your website into predefined categories. A closed card sort works best when you are working with a predefined set of categories, and you want to learn how users sort content items into each category. [Usability.gov - Card Sorting](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/card-sorting.html)


#### Method

Using Optimal Workshop, we would like to conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will receive a link to a card sort activity that contains a list of about 35 pieces of current & proposed content from the VA mobile app. Each participant sorts the content cards into one of several fixed categories (i.e., Health, Benefits, etc). They will also be able to add new categories.

We would like to get complete sorting responses from **at least 30 Veterans**, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA).

* [Recruiting email]()



## Recruitment

Ask Perigean to recruit 60 people using the cohorts below in order to get at least 30 completes. Ideally we would like to get ⅔ with experience using some VA benefits/services and ⅓ without this experience but interest in some.


### Recruitment Criteria (for everyone)

* Participants must be on a desktop computer & be willing to use it to complete the activity
* ALL are willing to do an activity from their computer that requires dragging and dropping items on their computer screen (NO screen reader users)
* At least 10 women
* Diversity across age groups
* Diversity across racial identities
* Diversity across education levels
* Diversity across rural and major metropolitan areas


### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort A (9 veterans)

* All must have experience with VA health care, disability AND education benefits

### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort B (9 veterans)

* All must have experience with one or more of the following VA benefits or services: VA health care, disability, education benefits


### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort C (9 veterans)

* All must have experience with VA benefits or services (any)


### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort D (9 veterans)

* All have NO experience with VA benefits or services but are interested in some


### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort E (9 veterans)

* All go online to access VA benefits and services


### Recruitment Criteria for Cohort F (9 veterans)

* All are female


### Coordination with Perigean

To assess potential participants' experiences with VA benefits or services, please use their answers to the Digital Service at VA User Research Participant Recruiting Screener Questionnaire question _Which VA benefits or services do you have any experience with?"_.

We will provide an [email template]() and a card sort activity link for Perigean to use when reaching out to each cohort of potential participants.

We will include a required field at the beginning of the card sort to collect a code from each participant. We expect Perigean to generate and provide a unique code to each participant for tracking completion and compensation. In order to minimize abandonment, please make very clear to participants that they need to use this code when they start the card sort.

We estimate it will take participants 15 minutes _(need to verify!)_ to complete the card sort.
