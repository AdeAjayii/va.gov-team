## Card List for Closed Card Sort
Based on the findings from our [Open Card Sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-sort-research-report.md#key-findings) regarding participants being confused about card descriptions & needing them to be explained ("All cards in sort were not clear to the Veterans", we modified our card descriptions to improve clarity. We also added 3 new cards.

## Categories for Closed Card Sort
Our hypothesis for the proposed categories (and the cards within them) are based on the dendrogram findings from the Open Card Sort, a review of the VA.gov website structure, and conversations with teams on the VA.gov side about future IA efforts, and was proceded by a ["bucket" exploration activity in mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1634908357710/58074b53d4942298679622026490db78c1ee8806?wid=0-1643840124216)
). Cards are listed here by short label - will use longer description text for card sort activity.
