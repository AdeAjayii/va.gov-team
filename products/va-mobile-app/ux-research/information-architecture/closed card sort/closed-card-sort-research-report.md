# Research Goals

The purpose of this work is to inform the information architecture, content and design of the VA Mobile app in order to deliver a solution that is usable, useful, and extensible. See [VA Mobile App: Information Architecture & Navigation - High Level Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/High%20Level%20Project%20Summary.md) for a high level summary of the entire 3-phase process.

Our **goal** in this study **(**Phase I - IA Research - Pt 2 - Closed Card Sort**) is to:
* **understand how users think about the current and possible future content** in the VA mobile app 
* **confirm what the high-level information architecture categories** should be in the VA mobile app


# Research Questions



How do veterans think about the current and proposed pieces of content on the VA Mobile app?



1. Do veterans understand the proposed categories?
Yes, however...
    1. Six participants suggested having sub categories would help. 
    2. "Benefits", "account," and "payments" had crossover. Participants expressed uncertainty about these categories.
    3. Seven people mentioned uncertainty about the payment section.
2. Are there any cards that veterans felt uncertain about what category to place them in?
    1. Yes, the following cards were split between 2 different categories.
        1. Access letters and documents proving your veteran status
        3.  COVID-19 updates & information
3. Are there any categories missing?
    1. Three participants added "Education"
2. Does previous exerience with specific services or tools within the VA (such as mobile app use) affect user mental models?
    1. Yes, there was a clear difference in responses from VA Mobile App users vs veterans not familiar with the mobile app. While the Health and Genaeral categories were similar for both with very high agreement (78% or above), the cards in "benefits", "account," and "payments" had a lower agreement (60% or less) for the non-mobie app userss.
 
    



# Methodology 


Using Optimal Workshop, we conducted an unmoderated study in which participants were invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants received a link to a card sort activity that contained a list of about 35 pieces of current & proposed content from the VA mobile app. Each participant sorted the content cards into one of several fixed categories (i.e., Health, Benefits, etc). They were also be able to add new categories if they felt that a card didn't fit into the provided categories.

* The [cards for this study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/closed%20card%20sort/closed-card-sort-categories-and-card-list.md#card-list-for-closed-card-sort) are (with a couple exceptions) the same cards that were included in the [Open Card Sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-Sort-Research-Plan.md), but with reworked descriptions for clarity).
* The [categories for this study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/closed%20card%20sort/closed-card-sort-categories-and-card-list.md#categories-for-closed-card-sort) were based on the [findings from the Open Card Sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-sort-research-report.md), a review of the current VA.gov website structure, and conversations with teams on the VA.gov side about future IA efforts).


# Hypotheses and Conclusions


1. Veterans will be able to categorize cards and name groups of cards presented in the card sort. 
    i. **True**
2. Veterans will categorize cards and name groups in a similar manner to how they are organized on VA.gov. 
    i. **False**
While the category "Health" had cards with strong agreement, similar to how it is organized on VA.gov, The cards in categories Benefits, Account, Payments, and General VA information did not have the same strong agreement with the cards in the main buckets on va.gov. The Category labeled "health" in the card sort is also a category on VA.gov whereas all the other categories have different names. 
3. Veterans will find the proposed Payments category intuitive & categorize all payment related cards there.
    i. **True** 
While the agreement was lower than expected for some of the cards in the payment category (46% on the low end), overall there was agrement with all of the payment cards we expected to be in the payment category.  
4. Veterans will categorize cards representing common mobile app actions in a way that’s consistent with other apps in the wild (ex: Account, Settings)
    i. **False** Veterans did not create new categories that follow common app patterns. 


# Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)_

1. Finding one: Participants agreed on which categories to place the majority of cards, with 34 out of 36 cards having “high” category agreement among participants (and of those, 20 cards having “very high” agreement)
- A few cards that had lower agreement among participants (less than 60% sorted them into the same category):
- VA letters and documents (nearly even split of 43% in Benefits & 48% in General VA Info)
- COVID-19 updates & information (54% in General VA Info, 39% in Health)

**However,** the cards participants sorted into each category varied & there was some overlap:
- Health had the strongest agreement around cards of all the categories, 80%
- Account & General VA Info had the lowest agreement, at 24% & 25% (These felt like catchall categories—participants sorted 33 different cards into Account and 22 into General VA Info)
- The new “Payments” category had fair agreement among participants (58%)
- There was some overlap in the cards sorted into the Benefits, Account, and Payments categories. Some participants also expressed uncertainty about these categories.



2. Finding two: Only a few participants created new categories 
- 5 out of 46 participants created new categories
- The most common new category created was Education (3)
- Other categories created: This App (1), VA Letters & Documents (1), Other (1), Computer/Cloud Documents (1)


3. Finding three: Previous use of the VA Mobile app seemed to affect participant mental models 
- 19 out of 46 participants reported they had used the VA Mobile app, 27 reported they had not
- Previous use of the VA Mobile app seemed to affect participant mental models around every category except Health (both groups had very high (78%+ agreement)


4. Finding four: Veterans’ prior use of VA.gov didn’t prevent them from placing cards in intended categories
- As expected, the majority of participants sorted cards related to Education, Letters & Disability in Benefits
- Despite being spread out across the website, the majority of participants sorted payment-related cards into the new Payments category


5. Finding five: Previous use of the VA Mobile app seemed to affect participant mental models around every category except Health (both groups had very high (78%+ agreement):
- Participants who reported that they were mobile users placed cards very similarly within all categories.
78% of participants agreed on the cards within Health, Benefits & Account 
60% of participants agreed on the cards within General VA Info, Payments

- Participants who reported that they were not mobile users placed cards differently within the categories.
78% of participants agreed on the cards within Health, and General VA Info.  
60% of participants agreed on the cards within Account, Benefits, Payments
13 cards had lower (<50%) agreement. 


6. Finding six: Nearly all participants (42 of 46) reported that they understood the proposed categories


**However,** more than half of participants (25) reported that they felt uncertain about where to place one or more cards (21 participants said they did not). 
-** 7 participants mentioned Benefits**
“Benefits, because almost everything fit somewhere else…” P7
“I felt uncertain about finding balance for benefits.” P6
- **7  participants mentioned Payments**
“Payments to and from; documents, etc. establishing veteran status…” P14
- **6 participants mentioned  a need for subcategories**
“...excessive number of cards in health and benefits without the ability to subcategorize…” P14
“I would want separate benefits tabs… one for education benefits and one for disability benefits” P23
- **2 participants mentioned Account**
“Anything with "MY" or my family status should be accessible in My personal account” P#1

**Recommendation 2:**
    Category labels and contents:
- Health:
Very high agreement overall. 
Keep category name & contents as proposed, explore adding subcategories in tree test taxonomy.
- Account:
High agreement overall. 
Move ‘VA letters & documents’ into this category, explore adding subcategories in tree test taxonomy. 
Because this ended up as a ‘catchall’ category for some participants, we recommend renaming the category “Profile” to better distinguish from Benefits category (“Account” label may be too general).
- Payments:
High agreement overall. 
Move ‘Manage direct deposit’ into this category. 
Keep category name (could also consider an alternate label, ‘Money?’ if Payments doesn’t feel inclusive enough of both payments and debts) & other content as proposed.
- General VA Info:
High agreement overall. 
Consider moving ‘share this app’ into this category. 
Because this ended up as a ‘catchall’ category for some participants, we recommend that we consider renaming this category or dropping it altogether and having items live on Home (as they do  currently).
- Benefits:
This category performed the poorest, but still had high agreement overall. 
Move ‘disability rating’ and ‘manage dependents’ into this category. 
I recommend keeping the category name, explore adding subcategories (Education, Disability) in tree test taxonomy to address extensibility (allowing the app to grow in terms of benefit feature set).


**Recommendation 3:**
Based on the difference in mental model between mobile vs non-mobile user, we recommend considering onboarding or cross-references for some cards to address the gap.

**Recommendation 4:**
Consider testing the findability of items in the current app’s IA using TreeJack to set a benchmark (so we have something to compare the findability of items against) before testing the new IA.

**Recommendation 5:**
As of 3/16/22, ‘COVID-19 updates’ isn’t on the VA.gov home page (but is still accessible via search, and vaccine information is included in the Health section)—we recommend following their lead in terms of including it on the homescreen.




# Next Steps

**Tree Test: **
What will we test: The proposed taxonomy for the VA Mobile app, informed by two rounds of card sorts.* Test should cover all categories & represent both easy tasks and cards/tasks that were most confusing to users, limited to 8-10 tasks.
Who: Veterans
Why are we testing: We are testing the findability of tasks within our proposed IA—we want to see if our new categories and labels are intuitive for users.
