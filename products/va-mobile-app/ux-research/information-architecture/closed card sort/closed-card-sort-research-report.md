# Research Goals

The purpose of this work is to inform the information architecture, content and design of the VA Mobile app in order to deliver a solution that is usable, useful, and extensible. See [VA Mobile App: Information Architecture & Navigation - High Level Summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-design/information-architecture-navigation/High%20Level%20Project%20Summary.md) for a high level summary of the entire 3-phase process.

Our **goal** in this study **(**Phase I - IA Research - Pt 2 - Closed Card Sort**) is to:
* **understand how users think about the current and possible future content** in the VA mobile app 
* **confirm what the high-level information architecture categories** should be in the VA mobile app


# Research Questions



How do veterans think about the current and proposed pieces of content on the VA Mobile app?



1. Do veterans understand the proposed categories?
Yes, however...
    1. Six participants suggested having sub categories would help. 
    2. "Benefits", "account," and "payments" had crossover. Participants expressed uncertainty about these categories.
    3. Seven people mentioned uncertainty about the payment section.
2. Are there any cards that veterans felt uncertain about what category to place them in?
    1. Yes, the following cards were split between 2 different categories.
        1. Access letters and documents proving your veteran status.
        2.  VA letters and documents
        3.  COVID-19 updates & information
3. Are there any categories missing?
    1. Three participants added "Education"
2. Does previous exerience with specific services or tools within the VA (such as mobile app use) affect user mental models?
    1. Yes, there was a clear difference in responses from VA Mobile App users vs veterans not familiar with the mobile app. While the Health and Genaeral categories were similar for both, the cards in "benefits", "account," and "payments" did not have as high of agreement for the non-mobie app userss.
 
    



# Methodology 


Using Optimal Workshop, we would like to conduct an unmoderated study in which participants are invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants will receive a link to a card sort activity that contains a list of about 35 pieces of current & proposed content from the VA mobile app. Each participant sorts the content cards into one of several fixed categories (i.e., Health, Benefits, etc). They will also be able to add new categories if they feel that a card doesn't fit into the provided categories.

We would like to get complete sorting responses from **at least 30 Veterans**, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA). Each cohort will access the study using a unique URL.

* The [cards for this study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/closed%20card%20sort/closed-card-sort-categories-and-card-list.md#card-list-for-closed-card-sort) are (with a couple exceptions) the same cards that were included in the [Open Card Sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-Sort-Research-Plan.md), but with reworked descriptions for clarity).
* The [categories for this study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/closed%20card%20sort/closed-card-sort-categories-and-card-list.md#categories-for-closed-card-sort) were based on the [findings from the Open Card Sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-sort-research-report.md), a review of the current VA.gov website structure, and conversations with teams on the VA.gov side about future IA efforts).


# Hypotheses and Conclusions


1. Veterans will be able to categorize cards and name groups of cards presented in the card sort. 
    i. **True**
2. Veterans will categorize cards and name groups in a similar manner to how they are organized on VA.gov. 
    i. **False**
While the category "Health" had cards with strong agreement, similar to how it is organized on VA.gov, The cards in categories Benefits, Account, Payments, and General VA information did not have the same strong agreement with the cards in the main buckets on va.gov. The Category labeled "health" in the card sort is also a category on VA.gov whereas all the other categories have different names. 
3. Veterans will find the proposed Payments category intuitive & categorize all payment related cards there.
    i. **True** 
While the agreement was lower than expected for some of the cards in the payment category (46% on the low end), overall there was agrement with all of the payment cards we expected to be in the payment category.  
4. Veterans will categorize cards representing common mobile app actions in a way that’s consistent with other apps in the wild (ex: Account, Settings)
    i. **False**
