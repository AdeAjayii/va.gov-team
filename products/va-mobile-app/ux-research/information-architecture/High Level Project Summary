This summary describes the background & motivation, purpose & research goals, research questions and planned process/methods. For detailed protocol on each part of the study, see [VA Mobile App User Research: Information Architecture & Navigation - Phase I - IA Research Overview](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hkv9YzDUkZLa0InzaPwJH-4HSgUng-I_brh5sYfR4RI/edit#), VA Mobile App Information Architecture - Phase II - Accounts Competitive Analysis, and VA Mobile App Information Architecture - Phase III - Evaluative Research.


## Background & Motivation

The VA Mobile app was designed to allow Veterans to more easily complete key transactions across VA Health and Benefits services. 

As the app grows in its feature set, the VA Mobile App team needs a better understanding of how Veterans would navigate benefits and health services within the mobile app. We want to ensure the structure and organization of the app makes sense and can accommodate the new features we have identified as of interest on our roadmap.

### Project Objectives & Goals 


#### OCTO-DE Objectives

The following are the [OCTO-DE objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports.



1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services


#### OCTO-DE Goals

The following are the [OCTO-DE goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) that this research supports.



1. Veterans can manage their health services online
2. Logged-in users can easily track applications, claims, or appeals online
3. Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features


#### Veteran Journey



* Primary point in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf): “Taking care of myself”
* Secondary points: “Reinventing myself, “Putting down roots,” and “Retiring”


### Previous User Research

No previous research exploring IA or veteran mental models are the content in the VA mobile app has been conducted. No previous research examining the usability of the current live VA mobile app has been conducted, however, [User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/testing/uat) was conducted in May 2021, as were several rounds of usability testing with a [Prototype in May 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/prototype-testing) and [March 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/usability-testing/round-1).


## Project Purpose & Goals

The purpose of this work is to inform the information architecture, content and design of the VA Mobile app in order to deliver a solution that is usable, useful, and extensible, before we scale the app to a larger audience. This is important, as it will allow us to easily add those future features without having to make Veterans learn new navigation paths as the app grows. We will conduct user research and design activities collaboratively to quickly explore the opportunity space and deliver a solution that is user-centered and achieves product goals. \




* **Phase I** of this work will give insight on the usability and comprehension of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">proposed information architecture</span> direction.
    * See more information on Phase I in this document. It describes a 3-part study that uses the following methods: open card sort, closed card sort, and tree test.
* **Phase II **of this work is a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">competitive analysis.</span> It will be done in parallel with Phase I.
    * See more information about the competitive analysis in this document.
* **Phase III** of this work will give insight on the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">usability and comprehension of the proposed UI direction</span>.
    * See more information on Phase III in this document. (TBD) It describes an evaluative study using usertesting.com.
