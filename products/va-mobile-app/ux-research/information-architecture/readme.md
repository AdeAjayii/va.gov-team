# Information Architecture

Last updated July 2021

## Background & goals
The information architecture outlines the hierarchy the MVP app navigation follows. The goal of this is to outline all the screens and navigation UX in the app.

As of July 2021 the information architecture is still a living artifact. As the app changes, updates will be made and reflected [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/NSzeU3CNgJmSQPg68NWnTB/Mobile-App---Design-Work-Sessions?node-id=66%3A273&scaling=scale-down-width). Below is a screenshot of the IA as of July 7, 2021.
