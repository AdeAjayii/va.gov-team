# IRIS Design + Content Specifications 

[Product Brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/iris/IRIS-product-brief.md)

## High Level Flow Diagram
 
The developers are working with the VA Form Builder for the flow, which should follow the basics of the form, review form and confirmation as the 'happy path' for the user flow.

### Global Notes

- Since this is a publicly facing experience on the VA.gov site, the VA.gov header and footer navigation areas will be present
- Interactions will follow the VA Form Builder and the VA Design System - no anticipated new design patterns will likely be necessary.
- Additional notes about interactions or content that apply globally will be updated as necessary and tracked on our [board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/orchidiris-5f29c3a0250c8f001f1397ac/board?repos=285091133
)
