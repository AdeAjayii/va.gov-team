# IRIS Usability Testing Conversation Guide - DRAFT
**7/21/2020**

## Introduction - 5 minutes - TO UPDATE

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Rachel and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experiences with IRIS, the Inquiry Routing & Information System (available at https://iris.custhelp.va.gov/), and ways you use it to find important information.  IRIS can be accessed by clicking on ‘Contact Us’ > ‘Ask a Question’ at the top of the va.gov site.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better serve Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- PROMPT FOR USABILITY TESTING - Have you ever participated in a usability test? If so, can skip.
- IF NEW USER: ask warm up questions. If not new user, skip.
- What we're going to do is have you interact with the redesigned IRIS form and have you do a couple of tasks.  I'll give you a task to complete and we'll have you talk us through it as you complete the task. Try to complete it as you normally would.
- The point of this is that we're testing the product - NOT you - so be as candid about what works and doesn't work as you interact with it.
- Then we'll follow up with a few questions and grab any additional feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
- Any questions?
-Start recording.

**I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"

## Thank You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work 
on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson?
If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
