# Usability Testing Research Plan for IRIS redesign, Fall 2020

As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team to ensure the usability testing is testing the right things at the right time to validate the right assumptions.	

## Goals

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

This usability testing will be on the IRIS redesigned product and this document will go into the goals more at the tasks and questions during the testing.  We want to ensure that the redesigned IRIS experience is an improvement on the existing product.

2. Background: 
Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?

Please view more about the IRIS project https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/iris/IRIS-product-brief.md

3. Research questions: 
What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 

We have research questions which we’ll use usability testing to answer.  The goal is to understand what, if any, we need to change before releasing the redesigned IRIS within our scope (i.e. not testing the VA Design Library per se).  We also want to explore topics such as Customer Satisfaction & Trust, Findability and (Task) Service Completion, three key factors that the Analytics team has indicated are goals for products within the VA. 

We also foresee multiple usability studies for IRIS because of our development roadmap:

- Testing the IRIS form: validating the work done so far
- Testing the full IRIS experience: validating the rest of the backlog stories ncluding Help text,  File attachments etc.

See conversation guide for details questions and tests.

Exit questions

We would also ask questions at the end of the session from earlier in this document (‘Did the number of chapters/pages of the form feel like the right length?’). We may also use the System Usability Scale (source).

I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
I found the system unnecessarily complex.
I thought the system was easy to use.
I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
I found the system very cumbersome to use.
I felt very confident using the system.
I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.


## Method	

1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
Usability testing with a link to the site on Staging via remote moderated research.  Because our product has conditional logic we want to test users with a version that is as high fidelity as possible.
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
 
We want to run our redesigned product by our end users to ensure we're building the right thing in the right way at the right time - the right set of features and ensure that it's accessible.  Usability testing and an interview about their interactions with a product will allow us to answer research questions and validate our assumptions about the product we’re building.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
Remotely via Zoom because of COVID-19.

4.	What will you be testing?

We will be testing with a version of the product on Staging. 

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)
We will be using Zoom.



## Participants and Recruitment


1. **Primary criteria / Must have** 

TBD

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?	TO FINISH

TBD

## When?

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?

These sessions will likely be one hour to allow for a relaxed conversation and the actual usability tests.
