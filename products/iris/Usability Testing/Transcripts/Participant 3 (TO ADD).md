# IRIS Usability Testing Notes

P3.IRIS usability testing.202012141400(2020-12-14 2pm)

## Participant Info

Do you have any accessibility requirements - do you use any assistive technology to access any part of va.gov (a screen reader or magnifier, for example)?  Yes (and what technology) / No

* Retired military, do a lot with the VA, retired 6 years ago, 100% disabled, most medical stuff is through VA, lots of equipment, it’s great because as they get more and more tech advanced, there’s more stuff I can use
* I have a hearing aid (new since last session), linked through bluetooth?

## Tech and mobile usage

What type of desktop, tablet and phone do you use (and operating system).  How long have you had that?

* Windows laptop + Desktop + tablet + android phone
* I do enjoy apps, I like the rewards (?) app, shop through the app for different places, I like that my history and account stuff is there, I appreciate that part of it
* Her computer doesn’t do BT, so that’s the only challenge, but she can call in to use it
* VA Apps on her phone: Prescription app, VA Retail app (used recently), tried to use some others but had issues with her DSLogon acting up, there’s two other login things now (MHV and ID.me), but for some reason the ID.me doesn’t let her login on her phone, that’s been the only thing, login has been funky


What do you used to access va.gov and where do you access it?

* Laptop

What browser do you use to access IRIS?

* Chrome?

Generally, how comfortable would you say you are with technology? Novice/Intermediate/Savvy?

*  Probably intermediate, maybe 5 years ago I’d say I was pretty savvy
*  But now more at the consumer level, when I need to update something, I’m not having to go to my teen to get something now :) 

## Product Experience

Have you contacted the VA? If so, when and how 

* I used to call for everything or go in, now that a lot of the stuff is getting streamlined, I’ll send Messages to primary care and pharmacy etc. Things are more accessible online than they would be, most stuff is on the web now
* 85% online - 15% is requests involving phone - from clinic, medical etc. or case manager.
* Sometimes I don't find an answer and they call me back i f i can’t find it.

How often have you used IRIS? 

*  Frequency: ~Once a month
*  Some of this is more than in the past, bc of COVID, 
*  Many of my appointments got cancelled and I’m trying to get back on in the queue 
sometimes I call and leave messages but could be the wrong number, so I find it better sometimes to use IRIS and get it handled there, asking a question
*  I’ve been able to get a prescription fixed that’s been wrong for years (!!), so it’s been shortening the red tape which has been really good


Did you use the COVID-19 Chatbot? If yes, how was that experience - do you usually use a chatbot? 

* Trying to think - it prompted me - yes, done
* If you saw a chatbot, would you reach for that? FAQs? If have a specific problem, say I did a search real quick, but couldn’t find the answer, I would use the chatbot, or if I know I need to talk to someone, I would call . Sometimes the questionnaires like that get a little tedious, that’s the only thing, don’t want to go through the 10 levels of that, did you say you want baloney?
* Did you say you wanted - clippy

What was the reason you were using IRIS?

*  Did not capture in notes

## Notes

Participant joined by phone! :) 

Where would you go to to submit a question or comment to the VA? 

* Where would you go to submit a question - I would normally scroll down to the bottom, look for contact me - contact us button
* Why Bottom? - antique thought process - contact us is traditionally at the bottom, if I was looking for something specific I might use the search bar, and kinda poke around, but that’s my first instinct going to the bottom
* So I see the Contact Us, they say it’s equal to the Form 0873, so that’s good that means it’s an official thing, save time and save your work in progress, sign in, oh yeah good idea, so I would sign in, (see login screen) so I would normally use MHV
* DS login always hokey on my computer 

Imagine you’re dealing with a problem with your eye glasses, and your local VA is in Allentown PA.  Show me how you would send a question to the VA about glasses, indicating it’s for yourself and that you want to find out kinds of glasses you can get with your benefits.

*  I would hit start your question, which category best describes your message?  Health and medical probably, chosen
*  Maybe prosthetics or medical issues, guessing with prosthetics  so I’ll go with that, then chose eyeglasses
*  I would rotate my screen so I can see the full description
*  Found the Medical center list Allentown PA
*  Asking if the glasses are covered under her current benefits
I turned my screen bc sometimes it cuts off what you can see and click on (intuitive about this possibility)
Fills out generic/dummy SSN, DOB,
“Service number is not required, so I’m not even going to mess with it”
Tried to submit and saw the SSN validation, oh dashes are allowed (so she scrolled back up and added dashes)
Her example on another form, there was no validation while she was typing in DOB, so she had to call to find out the issue
Using pseudonym “imalittlepiggy” Imalil Piggeaux? :) for spam
Reveiw page: Crosses/hashtags that open boxes - maybe I would have verified but then I would have clicked on submit
Good to be able to verify info.  Especially if you do have glasses
Confirmation number good




Now go ahead and fill in the rest of the form - you can just use fake data. (test@test.com) - but don’t submit the form. (Stop them after they’ve filled out their contact info, before they get to the submit page)

*  Drop down - is it a service complaint if glasses? This is a question.  I need an appointment so i can walk in. 
*  Probably I’ll type in I need an appt and they’ll say oh bc of covid we’re no longer doing that, so I’m like I’m supposed to just stay blind?
*  If I was doing this in public, I would have to stop and go back into my car bc I don’t trust ppl, when I’m typing in my SSN, you don’t know my whole social bro, bc at the end of the day, I’m giving you my last name and last 4 of my social, so all of this is too much, you’re doing too much, if I would show up and talk to a human and they only need ⅛ of this, then you’re already aggravating me, don’t ask me a million questions, I’m already aggravated
*  That’s part of my thought process, if I was talking to a real person, and I wouldn’t give you all this information, then why are you asking all of this? They don’t ask you for your full social, they ask you last name and last 4 (social) and then verify your DOB

Now before you click submit, what do you think will happen? (Now go ahead and click on submit).  Is that what you expected to happen?

*  Where is this going - drone in sky? Again, if you go to any other company, right after these 3 blocks, they should give me a snippet of information about allentown, like these are the hours and address and phone number
*  Dummy confirmation number
*  Am I going to get an email with this number too? Otherwise you’re relying on me taking a screenshot here
*  This whole process is going to take me 10min, after that I find that you’re going to take 5 days to get back to me??
*  My friend, she needs glasses and she’s been waiting for 9 months! Her migraines are out of control, her neuro says she needs a new prescription
*  And for me, for 5 months I didn’t have a functioning arm! How am I supposed to help my family? I’m supposed to be getting a nursing degree, then my blood pressure is (through the roof), how am I supposed to help my patients? 
*  I think they need to let go of all this asking for your SSN, the DoD has stopped asking for it, I’m over it, stop asking for my full social
*  What if i’m having a crisis - 5 days?

# Questions

Now that you’ve seen the full form, would you sign in before completing the form - why or why not?

*  We don’t need to ask people to ask their social 

_Chapters:  What was your impression of chapters?_

*  i did like the separate pages.  
*  If you’re on your phone and spotty connection - friend doesn’t have reliable - so 
*  So every time you go to another page, you run the risk of starting over,  some of those pages could have been merged, you don’t need my full social, if you ask for my DOB, cut out the extra, less pages to load, less potential connectivity problems
*  If you could limit down less pages, that would be ideal
*  I have fantastic internet and it’s great so when my friend comes here, it’s great, but hers isn’t
*  Saving is essential for mobile
*  Slim it to less pages 

Is any content missing - fields or features you were expecting to see?

*  Long drop list isn’t useful - having search would be beneficial for states etc. First two or three letters of clinic would be useful.

Is any content extra - things that you don’t think are necessary?
*  See above

_Review chapter_

What did you think would happen after you’ve submitted the form? What do they want to happen after submitting the form? Does the confirmation message provide enough info?
*  Here I’m working on my computer, I don’t really need to review, but 90% of the ppl that will use this, will be on their cell phones and the phones are fantastic at autocorrect, CBOK or other words that will be autocorrected
*  Who’s more important? If I type into the box “I need glasses” or “I could see last week and now this week I also crashed because my vision is so bad”
*  Always good to review stuff, if i’m on computer 
*  90 percent of people using phones - but there's autocorrect so that helps but i’s not great. Fat fingering on phones happen all the time, a is right next to s or d

If we had a ‘review and submit’ button, would you use it as opposed to directly submitting the form?

*  Answer: I would have to go back and see the dropdown again, there were three dropboxes (expandable boxes on the review page), but I think that is excessive
*  All I need is contact info in one area (not three boxes on review page?)
*  Don’t review the contact info bc you’ve already had them look over it and that’s just repeat and repeat then no one likes that
*  Who am i sending this to? Location and what message is.  That's all i need (to review).
*  Sometimes when I’m helping people, I’m doing lots of amounts but all I need to review is the clinic/facility location and what I’m asking for, everything else I don’t need
*  Confirmation number doesn’t help me - is this going to allentown clinic? Entity you’re contacting and what you’re trying to say is what should be in the review
*  If it’s not a requirement/required field, then maybe it shouldn’t even be on the page at all!

_In general_

Comparing the existing version of IRIS to this redesign, is this an improvement? Why or why not? What part is an improvement?
