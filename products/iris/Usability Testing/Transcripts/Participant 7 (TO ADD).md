P7.IRIS usability testing.202012161000 (2020-12-16 10am)

## Participant Info

Do you have any accessibility requirements - do you use any assistive technology to access any part of va.gov (a screen reader or magnifier, for example)?  Yes (and what technology) / No

* no

## Tech and mobile usage

What type of desktop, tablet and phone do you use (and operating system).  How long have you had that?

* HP laptop, generally what I use for work, I do have an ipad and iphone, would never get a mac laptop, not that technologically smart, have enough trouble dealing with the iphone. I actually have another small HP that I bought on a whim but I generally don’t use it anymore

What do you used to access va.gov and where do you access it?

* my phone, because it’s always in my hand

What browser do you use to access IRIS?

* on iphone safari, on computer it’s google chrome

Generally, how comfortable would you say you are with technology? Novice/Intermediate/Savvy?

*  TO FINISH....

## Product Experience

Have you contacted the VA? If so, when and how 

*   

How often have you used IRIS? 

*  

Did you use the COVID-19 Chatbot? If yes, how was that experience - do you usually use a chatbot? 

*   

What was the reason you were using IRIS?
*  

## Notes

Where would you go to to submit a question or comment to the VA? 

*   
 
What do you expect to see on a ‘Contact us’ page?

*  

Imagine you’re dealing with a problem with your eye glasses, and your local VA is in Allentown PA.  Show me how you would send a question to the VA about glasses, indicating it’s for yourself and that you want to find out kinds of glasses you can get with your benefits.

*  

Now go ahead and fill in the rest of the form - you can just use fake data. (test@test.com) - but don’t submit the form. (Stop them after they’ve filled out their contact info, before they get to the submit page)

*  
Now before you click submit, what do you think will happen? (Now go ahead and click on submit).  Is that what you expected to happen?

*  

# Questions

Now that you’ve seen the full form, would you sign in before completing the form - why or why not?

*   

_Chapters:  What was your impression of chapters?_

*  

Is any content missing - fields or features you were expecting to see?

*   
Is any content extra - things that you don’t think are necessary?
*   

_Review chapter_

What did you think would happen after you’ve submitted the form? What do they want to happen after submitting the form? Does the confirmation message provide enough info
*  


If we had a ‘review and submit’ button, would you use it as opposed to directly submitting the form?

*   

_In general_

Comparing the existing version of IRIS to this redesign, is this an improvement? Why or why not? What part is an improvement?

*   

_Content_

We simplified the categories in the drop down menu - what was that experience like? Did you feel confused?

*
