## Participant Info


Do you have any accessibility requirements - do you use any assistive technology to access any part of va.gov (a screen reader or magnifier, for example)?  Yes (and what technology) / No

* No glasses, mobile limits for my right arm
* Clamp thing - VA took too long, clinic couldn’t get it right, so ended up paying for it out of pocket - also meds out of pocket
* When it comes to websites where I need both hands, lots of typing involved, then it’s a bit of a challenge, apply my creams and my medicine, if I need something at 4pm, then I’m on my own because I’m on central time, I have to change what I’m wearing to change the pressure here, I only wear a bra certain times, can’t lift it up, depends on my pain situation that changes how functional I can be that day
* Can’t sit in the car too long, chronic disorder? Never going to book appointments during certain times, i’m not going to start my day with the VA, the fact that the VA thinks that’s okay
* It affects when i use va.gov or paperwork - can’t sit in car etc.
