Date: 2020-12-02

## Status
Proposed


## Context

The issue motivating this decision, and any context that influences or constrains the decision.

Contact Management
- Flow when logged in user is the primary contact on the case
- Flow when logged in user is not the primary contact on the caseÂ 
- Flow when duplicate matches are found
- Associating the inquiries to contacts in the backend
- Migration strategy for GI Bill accounts from OSvC to VA.gov

Current actors on the FE: Requestor/Inquirer, Veteran, Dependant, On behalf of, General Public (Non-Veteran), Organizations (GI Bill School administrators, Funeral Home/Cemetary directors) 
- Who is the inquirer?
- What is the subject of the inquiry?

- Looking for existing relationships based on data VA already knows should happen in the backend, for the responder. If existing services (for e.g., PoA service or BGS service for dependents) we should try to reuse rather than create new relationships that are unverified. 
- 4 unique identifiers for MPI: Email, Claim Number. SSN, Service Number (per Nick)
Do we want to do MPI lookup on the FE? 

Identify the veteran
Identify the subject of the inquiry 

- Prioritizing the user experience
Optimizing for the ease of Veteran experience: 
- minimize the number of required fields, and make them as optional fields to reduce the form filling burden
- with the login option of ID proofed, VA.gov authentication, pre-filling would ease the burden of form filling, and additional benefits of saving drafts

- Optimizing for the ease of the Contact Center agents: 
- collect additional fields up front to reduce feedback cycle loop of going back and forth nature of verifying user (ID Proofing) for specific inquiries, with PII, PHI data
