- There are a number of ways the VA is working to help people when they get help, including chatbots, FAQs, IRIS, search and others. What is your preferred order of how you use them?
- What you’re looking to do on them - why you use what you use and when
- Would they use chatbot or FAQ before submitting the Contact Us form? Why or why not? What needs to change before

##Landing page/triaging 

- Issue  How might we create a more customized experience before the form to get triaged help?
- Tie previously engaged content (across channels like FAQs) into the pre-populated form (‘we noticed you search for health…’, because you selected x, we’ll need y…’)’ - the ‘users like you found this helpful’?
- Is this a better experience than selecting options via the drop down menus?
- Would you engage with these FAQs before submitting your question?
- Does having triaging or encouragement to stand in the way of the form completion?
- Is the content on this page overwhelming? Would you find icons helpful here?

# Secure messaging

# Search Experience

See related story (#224) on a concept of a single free text dropdown

- Explore if this matches their language expectations (like seeing a destination/path name) - are there challenges with Type Ahead and not knowing what something is called?
- Explore if this feels less overwhelming than three drop downs
-  Explore if visually this feels like a modern Web experience (i.e. VA.gov search does this type ahead)
