## Research Goals 

IRIS is the Inquiry Routing & Information System at https://iris.custhelp.va.gov/app/ask.  Because of mounting operating costs VEO has kicked off an initiative to migrate to more modern technologies, improve the experience for end users of IRIS and GI Bill through using the VA Design System and backed by data from user research.  The ThoughtWorks team has been working with VA SMEs and our product owner since mid-July 2020 with an anticipated launch in Summer 2021.  The goal of this usability study was to evaluate whether the redesigned IRIS product is successfully addressing pain points in the current experience. While some of the content for the topics of inquiries (i.e. options on the drop down menus) is still being revised the team conducted usability testing to get feedback on work so far to ensure the core functionality of how we’ve structured the product was valid (ie. use of chapters, review page etc.). The research questions to address if we’ve been successful in our product included the following (in alphabetical order):


* Content strategy: 
  * Do users understand the content in the form (especially the drop down menus) and how to fill in each field (the right content in the components?)
  * Do users find having a ‘Review the form’ page valuable?
  * Do users find merging the GI Bill form and the IRIS form into one form acceptable?

* Information design: 
  * Do users find having chapters valuable, and if so, are the form’s chapters the right number and right content on each chapter 
  * Do users feel the form’s fields are organized on each chapter in an inuitive manner?

* Interaction design: 
  * Do users login to use the application?
  * Do users understand how the information is displayed in a clear and understandable manner (the right UI controls in the components)? 
  * What do users think will happen after they’ve submitted and what do they want to happen (and what kind of information to see)?
  * Would users use the form on their mobile device - why or why not?

* Navigation/Information architecture
  * Are users able to navigate through the form easily and complete the form?


## Research Methodology 

A task-based usability study was conducted remotely with GoToMeeting between Dec. 14th to 18th, 2020. A remote moderator began with an introduction on the purpose of the session, and participants completed one main usability task - to submit a question about their eye glasses tied to their local VA in Allentown PA for themselves using the redesigned IRIS experience on staging.va.gov.  Both Web and mobile versions were tested, and participants were asked a series of questions afterward as tied to the research questions below.  Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance.

The research assessed the form’s ability to support users on one main task, the ability of a user to fill out the form (navigating screen by screen, understanding the language on the form, etc.). 8 of 8 participants were able to successfully submit the form.  For full details of the sessions please see the transcripts of the sessions.
