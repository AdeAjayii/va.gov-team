# Design Principles
---

## Overview
These are some of the design principles the IRIS team is using as we develop the product.  While we are using the VA Design Library as our first source of truth and are working with the VA Form Library wherever possible, we're also working to incorporate these best practices below.  This list will evolve so check back frequently.

* Avoid confusion for the screenreader users when new fields are displayed/triggered

* Enable the team to give feedback to the design during mockup

* Ensure section headers are used consistently and the right amount of them to both allow screen readers to work but also not overwhelm the user with them

* Limit customization of form library

* Limit the amount of page scrolling up and down whenever the validation message gets triggered

* Use radio buttons when there are less than 5 options
