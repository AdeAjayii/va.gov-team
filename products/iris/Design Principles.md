# Design Principles
---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*


* Limit the amount of page scrolling up and down whenever the validation message gets triggered

* Ensure section headers are used consistently and the right amount of them to both allow screen readers to work but also not overwhelm the user with them

* Limit customization of form library

* Enable the team to give feedback to the design during mockup

* Avoid confusion for the screenreader users when new fields are displayed/triggered
