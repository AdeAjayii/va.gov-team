| Access to Github repo                                   | The Orchid repo on Github was used to store documentation, shared team setup details, and technical explorations. The SRA team might find some of this information useful as they continue to build out the IRIS work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/orchid                                                                                                                                  |

| User Journey mapping session notes                      | Team Orchid facilitated a User Journey mapping session with various leads from the Digital Experience Product Office (DEPO) to pull together some of the different options available for a veteran to self serve as well as contact the VA for their questions. The primary goals for this exercise were to: 1) define a streamlined ‘Get Help’ experience for the veteran, and 2) establish a shared agreement on how all the different pieces integrate with each other.                                                                                                                  | https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/iris/product/Get-Help-User-Journey-Mapping-notes.md                                                    |

| [Analytics] Success metrics                             | As part of the VSP collaboration cycle and developing our product, Team Orchid worked with the analytics team to put together a list of qualitative and quantitative metrics. Once the product was ready to launch, these metrics would be used to measure success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/iris/product/Success-Metrics.md                                                                        |
| [Analytics] Oracle metrics for IRIS, GI Bill and MHV-TS | Metrics for the existing IRIS, GI Bill and MHV-TS pages on Oracle can be pieced together from different sources. There are monthly reports generated by Michelle Hoxsie-Quinn (Oracle Service Cloud Administrator) which include numbers about total FAQ views and inquiries created (by inquiry type). There are also some high-level metrics around page views and device types by users captured by DAP Google Analytics for the IRIS page. In order to access either of these sources, you will need a VA.gov email address. To get access to DAP for IRIS, please contact dap@gsa.gov. | - Monthly FAQ views & inquiries created for IRIS, GI Bill, or MHV-TS  - IRIS page views by date range - IRIS users device breakdown by date range                                         |
| Tech strategy diagrams                                  | Team Orchid used LucidChart software to create collaborative diagrams representing tech strategy and architecture for the IRIS replacement work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/iris/engineering/doc/architecture/diagrams                                                             |

| Veterans-facing Service Platform Collaboration Cycle    | Team Orchid worked with DSVA and the Veteran-facing Services Platform (VSP) to align our product development with the VSP collaboration cycle. The collaboration cycle includes key steps such as, accessibility review, usability testing and privacy/security review. Though the IRIS replacement work will be utilizing the omnichannel portal, parts of the collaboration cycle are still relevant and should be addressed.                                                                                                                                                             | https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle                                                               |
| Digital Service VA (DSVA) Slack channels                | Given Team Orchid worked closely with DSVA for the new Veteran-facing side of IRIS, we documented a short list of Slack channels that were part of our workflow. Some are beneficial to hear about relevant updates from other teams, while others are more useful when asking for help related to developing on the platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/orchid#slack-channels                                                                                                                   |
