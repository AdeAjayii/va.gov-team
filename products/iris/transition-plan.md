There are also some high-level metrics around page views and device types by users captured by DAP Google Analytics for the IRIS page. In order to access either of these sources, you will need a VA.gov email address. To get access to DAP for IRIS, please contact dap@gsa.gov. 	| - Monthly FAQ views & inquiries created for IRIS, GI Bill, or MHV-TS <br>- IRIS page views by date range<br>- IRIS users device breakdown by date range                                   	|
