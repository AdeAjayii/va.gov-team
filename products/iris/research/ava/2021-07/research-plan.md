# Research Plan for VSP, Ask VA, July 2021

## Goals

This study is being conducted by the VSP Contact Center team. The study follows the Ask VA (AVA) tool, which enables veterans and VA.gov users to submit inquiries digitally.

**Usability Study Goals:**

- Document and prioritize any outstanding usability concerns with AVA, including both inquiry submission and the authenticated dashboard.
- Verify the implementation of recommendations provided from previous usability testing.
- Test potential AVA landing pages to determine the most user-friendly option.

**Research Questions:**

- Are users able to submit inquiries successfully and without hindrance?
- Are users able to navigate and access previous inquiries via the authenticated dashboard?
- Do veterans understand how to fill out all of the fields on the inquiry form?
  - Is help text provided in all the appropriate areas?
  - Do users understand which fields are required? 
- Which landing page iteration is the most user-friendly for veterans?

**Hypothesis:**

- Veterans will be able to successfully submit inquires through AVA. 

## Method

We will conduct remote moderated usability testing and directed interviews via Zoom using the Perigean contract. These methods will help us:
