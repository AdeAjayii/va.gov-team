## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [ Michael, from the Platform Contact Center team] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about [new AVA Dashboard business and personal tabs]. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [30-40 mins].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a current version of AVA with the new tab function.** 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

### Things to watch for:

## Post-Task Interview - 15 minutes

- What is your overall impression of this new feature?  
- Does the new tab feature help reduce workload in filter and organizing cases in your dashboard? (Goal: Separate work vs personal inquiry?)
- Is this new experience more streamlined for your overall needs? 
- Do you have any questions for me or any other feedback you would like to share? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
