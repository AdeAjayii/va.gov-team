### Description
This page will be the main Contact Us form that will allow users to include their contact information, and will allow the VA to understand who is contacting them and why.

### Interaction Notes

- The main way of interaction on this page is via a series of drop down menu boxes that follow the VA standards for contact information (name, addres etc.)
- There is conditional logic tied to role - so that if a user selects they are a beneficiary of a Veteran, for example, they will indicate more about the type of relationship they have to the Veteran.
- Standard VA form calls to action (buttons at the bottom allowing users to go back of forward) are included.

### Content - TO DO

The two main pages of the Contact Us form - the Contact Us page and the Inquiry Details page) - are different lengths, but I believe it makes sense to keep these separate pages, even one is very long and one isn't.  Since most of these are standard contact us (name, address etc.) this should be fairly easy for people to fill out; we should ensure conditional logic (selecting beneficiary triggers another drop down) is well understood, especially the copy.

We'e working with stakeholders from the IRIS Interface, GI Bill, and MHV and will be interating with the fields as the stories evolve.
