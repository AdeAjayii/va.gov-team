## Decision log

### Header decisions

| Problem/Question/Challenge | Decision | Date |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Thing 1 |   |   |


### Footer decisions

#### Assumptions
* We will keep the 4 "buckets" as-directed by OFCIO and validate the headers (Information for, More resourcecs, Connect with us, Contact us) as we understand it: "The goals of the 4 columns is to put the same kind of information in the same place on the HISP footers"
* The footer is not just for Veterans, the "Information for" first column is to use non-core audience off-ramps via that first column.
*  The "Contact us" header in the footer may be a bit misleading. Will need to validate through research. Is the expectation of "Contact us" that I, as a user, am directly contacting VA

3/21/2023 - Meeting to cross walk existing footer with new footer - Attendees: Ryan T, Mikki N., Dave C., Danielle T.

| Problem/Question/Challenge | Decision | Date |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| What's the semantic difference between "Information for" and using "Connect with us" audience-based? | ------ | ------ |
| How do we have governance around this? | ------ | ------ |
| Public affairs exists in the header. As a result, do we need "Media" in the footer? | No. Duplicative | ------ |
| Congressional affairs exists in the header. Do we need "Congress" in the footer? |  No. Duplicative  |    |
| Health research exists in the header. Do we need "Researchers" in the footer? |  No. Duplicative  |    |
| Job seekers is not in header | Look at the analytics to see click-thrus, but consider adding to "About VA and removing? |  |  
| Adaptive Sports - Does that meet the criteria for this column? | We will check the analytics to see if it's useful  |   |
| Job seekers - Is the destination for "get a job with VA" or "I'm a Veteran and need help getting a job" |  |  |  

##### More resources/2nd column
BLUF: Links to be placed in this column are:
- Resources and Support (new label?)
- VA forms
- VA health care access and quality
- VA mobile apps
- State Veterans Affairs offices
- VA outreach materials (may be deprecated)
- VA (outreach?) events
- Your VA welcome kit
- National Resource Directory

| Problem/Question/Challenge | Decision | Date |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| National Resource Directory (nrd.gov) | Not VA, but this is more resources for our core audience, assuming we keep it. | ------ |


##### Connect with us/3rd column
BLUF: Links to be placed in this column are:
- VA news
- Press releases
- Email updates
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Twitter
- Flickr
- YouTube
- All VA social media

| Problem/Question/Challenge | Decision | Date |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Need content curation/limitation guardrails |   |   | 
| What about ensuring a visual balance between the 4 columns and wrapping  |   |   | 
| Does this category label work for this content? | **Need to discuss with Andy**  |   | 

##### Contact us/4th column

BLUF: Links to be placed in this column are:
- Veterans Crisis Line (triggers modal or links to page?)
- Ask our chatbot a question (Chatbot)
- Contact us online through AskVA
- Call us: 800-698-2411 (MyVA 411)
- TTY: 711

We are concerned about the "Contact us" label for this column. We would lean more toward "Get support" but can validate via research.

| Problem/Question/Challenge | Decision | Date |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| "Find a VA location" in the footer | Double-check analytics, but likely remove it. | 3/21/2023  |
| "Veteran Crisis Line" in the footer | We will keep this  | 3/21/2023  |
| "Contact us" or "Get support" in the footer.| **Need to dicuss with Andy.** Pitch is to validate modified or optional heading via research of "Get support" not "Contact us". One of the reasons we have currently separated our existing fourth block into sub-blocks like "Get Answers" is that Veterans correllate "Contact us" with a means of directly contacting a person. Resources and Support is a self-service tool, but not a means of contacting us. Same with Chatbot because this isn't a human, so it's a bit awkward. Without flexibility we could run the risk of blowing out the "Resources" column |   |
| Content curation/guardrials in Contact/Support column - There are so many ways to contact VA it's crazy and how do we prioritize? | Is there research around existing Contact Us page to frame decisions? Can we just anchor links? Otherwise will need to establish governance rubric. "what is the maximum number of links in each of the columns?" **TBD** |  |
| What is the usage of the phone numbers/links on the existing footer? |   |   |
| Chatbot label | Don't use "Chat with us" because that indicates talking to a human. On "Contact us" it's "Ask our chatbot a question" | 3/21/2023 | 
| "Contact us" in the header | This will link to the ["Contact Us" page](https://www.va.gov/contact-us/) | 3/21/2023  |
| "Resources and support" in the footer | This is not a contact mechanism. This is a resource mechanism. Also unsure of the effectiveness of this 'branding' Reconsider name of this section on VA.gov | 3/21/2023  |
| "Contact us online through AskVA will inevitably catch Medical questions. What do we do? |    |    |
| Does MyVA411 also answer questions for non-Veterans and route accordingly? (e.g. Business, Congress, Job Seekers, Media) | Yes - confirmed with Chante that MyVA411  answer questions for anyone, and they should route non-Veteran audiences accordingly but that can be hit or miss.  |  |
