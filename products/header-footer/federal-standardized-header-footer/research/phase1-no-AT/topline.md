This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on **wayfinding using the new Federal header and footer, including the new USA logo and VA seal**. 

## Participants
We talked to **10 people**--9 Veterans, 2 Caregivers, 2 family members, and 1 Service member (some people had multiple roles).
