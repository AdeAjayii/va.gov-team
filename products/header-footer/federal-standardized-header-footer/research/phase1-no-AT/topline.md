This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on **wayfinding using the new Federal header and footer, including the new USA logo and VA seal**. 

## Participants
We talked to **10 people**--9 Veterans, 2 Caregivers, 2 family members, and 1 Service member (some people had multiple roles).
- Half (5 of 10) saw the **mobile** version of the prototype from a smartphone 
- Half (5 of 10) saw the **desktop** version of the prototype from a tablet or computer 
- Most participants had **experience using *VA.gov*** and/or the VA mobile app. Only one participant (a caregiver and spouse of a Veteran) had never used them before, and 2 other participants had used them only once or twice.  

## Preliminary Findings
### Usability Successes
1. **None of the 10 participants mentioned missing the "VA" logo**, so it seems to be fine to not have that on the page.
1. None of the 10 participants commented on font size, but both pilot participants (who were Veterans) said unprompted that they **liked the font size**. One of them said, *"I didn't have to get out my reading glasses to read anything, so that was that was a big plus for me" (pilot 1).* 
1. One participant noticed the different fonts between the header/footer and the page content. They said that they **preferred the font in the header bar** and the US Department of Veterans Affairs because of its sharp/clean edges (vs. the blurry/rounded letters in the life insurance content).


### How recognize as an official government website
1. Most (7 of 10) participants said that they would look at the URL to see if it's *.gov* or *VA.gov*.

### Authentication (task: change mailing address with VA)
1. After signing in using the prototype, **3 of 10 participants didn't recognize that they were actually signed in** because the user interface didn't change much. The subtle change of "Sign in" to "Sign out" (mobile) or "Cameron" (desktop) wasn't easy for everyone to notice.
1. **Two of 5 *phone* users had difficulty finding the Auth menu** (under "Cameron" in the mobile header menu); the other 3 phone users found it easily.  We might want to consider moving the Auth menu out of the mobile header menu.
1. **Two of 5 *desktop* users had difficulty finding the Auth menu** (by clicking on "Cameron"), but the other 3 found it easily. Results might have been different if the menu had shown the participant's real name.
1. **After opening the Auth menu, all participants readily clicked on the Profile menu**. However, 2 participants then wondered aloud if they should try My VA instead (didn't work in the prototype).
1. 3 of 10 participants navigated to *VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu > Records > Change your address* (this link didn't work in the prototype) to learn how to change your mailing address before signing in.

## Next Steps
- Synthesize data
- Write research report
