This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on **wayfinding using the new Federal header and footer, including the new USA logo and VA seal**. 

## Participants
We talked to **10 people**--9 Veterans, 2 Caregivers, 2 family members, and 1 Service member (some people had multiple roles).
- Half (5 of 10) saw the **mobile** version of the prototype from a smartphone 
- Half (5 of 10) saw the **desktop** version of the prototype from a tablet or computer 

## Preliminary Findings
### Usability Successes
1. 

### How recognize as an official government website
1. Most participants said that they would look at the URL to see if it's .gov or VA.gov

### Authentication (task: change mailing address with VA)
1. After signing in using the prototype, 3 of 10 participants didn't recognize that they were actually signed in because the user interface didn't change much. The subtle change of "Sign in" to "Sign out" (mobile) or "Cameron" (desktop) wasn't easy for everyone to notice.
1. 3 of 5 phone users easily found the Auth menu (under "Cameron" in the mobile header menu), but the other 2 phone users had difficulty. We might want to consider moving the Auth menu out of the mobile header menu.
1. 3 of 5 desktop users readily opened the Auth menu (by clicking on "Cameron"), but the other 2 had difficulty. Results might have been different if the menu had the participant's real name.
1. After opening the Auth menu, all participants readily clicked on the Profile menu. However, 2 participants then wondered aloud if they should try My VA instead (didn't work in the prototype).
1. 3 of 10 participants went to *VA Benefits and Health Care megamenu > Records > Change your address* (this link didn't work in the prototype) to learn how to change your mailing address, and then signed in afterwards.

### Logos 
1. no VA OK

## Next Steps
- Synthesize data
- Write research report
