# Research Plan: Search Designs
 	
## Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on new design concepts for surfacing site search and other search tools. 

## Background
User research findings from the VA.gov home page ([May 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md) and [
Feb 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/research-study-jan-2021/research-findings.md)) have indicated that site search and other search tools are not noticed and used as much as we anticipated. To address this, the Search & Discovery team is considering new ideas for better surfacing site search and other search tools.

## Research questions
- What are users' reactions to a landing page that highlights search tools? 
- Do users try using the search tools from links on the landing page?
- How do users react to Search in the header taking them to a landing page?
- How do users react to new search link(s) in the "top 4" boxes taking them to a landing page?
- Do users try using the search tools from links on the search results page?
- Are users able to complete tasks without getting stuck?

## Hypotheses
- A search landing page that highlights other search tools will result in more users using the search tools.
- A search results page that highlights other search tools will result in more users using the search tools.
- New search link(s) in the "top 4" boxes will results in fewer users getting stuck while trying to complete tasks.

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants will be given some tasks to do with a design prototype.

## Participants and Recruitment	
Ask Perigean to recruit 15 Veterans in order to get 8 completed sessions using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants
- At least 3 participants over 60
- At least 2 people with a cognitive disability (e.g., TBI)

### Good to have for participants
- At least 2 people of color
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 participant 35 or under
- At least 2 people who don't have any degree or vocational training after high school (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least 1 person that has a college degree (to include officer Veterans)
- At least 2 people who live in a rural or remote area
- At least 1 person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least 1 non-native English speaker

### Recruitment requirements for ALL participants
- Have a computer, tablet, or smartphone and be willing to be complete their interview on one of those devices
- During the session, be willing to share a new web browser window on their device 
- Have a working microphone on their device
- Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen

### Additional questions to ask in the screener
- What kind of device will you be joining on and are willing to share a browser window on--computer, tablet, or smartphone?
