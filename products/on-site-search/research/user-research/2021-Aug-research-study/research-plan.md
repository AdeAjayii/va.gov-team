# Research Plan: Search Design Concepts
 	
## Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on new design concepts for surfacing site search and other search tools. We plan to test the following design concepts:
- A new search landing page with links to other search tools
- New links on the VA.gov home page that go to the new search landing page
- New links on the search results page that go to other search tools

Research findings (including how many participants clicked on which links) will be used to recommend which of the above design concepts might be helpful to users going forward, before we do more design exploration. 

In 3-6 months or after some or all of the design concepts have been launched, we should look at the analytics and assess the actual usage of the new links.

## Background
User research findings from the VA.gov home page ([May 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-report.md) and [
Feb 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/research-study-jan-2021/research-findings.md)) have indicated that users get stuck while working on tasks because they're so focused on the "top 4" boxes, and that site search and other search tools are not noticed and used as much as we hoped. To address this, the Search & Discovery team is considering new ideas for better surfacing site search and other search tools.

## Research questions
1. What are users' reactions to a landing page that highlights search tools? 
1. Do users try using the search tools from links on the landing page?  
1. What are users' reactions to Search in the header taking them to a landing page?
1. What are users' reactions to new search link(s) in the "top 4" boxes taking them to a landing page?
1. Do users try using the search tools from links on the search results page?
1. Are users able to complete tasks without getting stuck?

## Hypotheses
1. A search *landing* page that highlights other search tools will result in more users using the search tools and finding what they're looking for.
1. A search *results* page that highlights other search tools will result in more users using the search tools and finding what they're looking for.
1. New search link(s) in the "top 4" boxes will result in more users finding what they're looking for.

## Method--Overview
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants will be given tasks to do using a design prototype; ideally, some will be on desktop and some will be on mobile.

## Method--Details
### Potential pages for the design prototype:
![screen-flow-diagram](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/images/Screen%20Flow%20Diagram%20for%20Search%20Prototype.jpg)

### Potential search tasks (that are not in the "top 4" boxes):
1. Submit a statement from someone to help support your request for VA benefits (search for "statement" in site search or go to Find a form; this is top forms search #4--for form 21-4138)
1. Get reimbursed for travel to medical appointment via direct deposit (search for "travel" or go to Resources and support)
1. Find out if there is a VA hospital located near a specific city that you plan to visit (search for city name or go to Find a VA location)
1. Find the form to appoint a representative to help with your disability claim (search or go to Find a form)
1. *IDEAS FROM DENISE?*

**Notes:**
- We plan to show some *unhelpful* search results and see what participants do next (on the page they're looking at and/or navigating back to the home page).
- We will likely need *a separate prototype for each task* so that search queries and search results can be different.

### To Do's:
- [ ] Cindy would like to provide input on Megan's design concepts for the search landing page, the search results page, and new links on the VA.gov home page. 
  - [ ] Denise proposed a design workshop on design ideas for adding link(s) to home page (i.e., separate search box, above "top 4" boxes, below "top 4" boxes", inside all 4 "top 4" boxes)
  - [ ] Shawna would like to be included in the discussion of the search results page (Denise, too?)
- [x] Cindy will draft a flow diagram for the prototypes showing screens and clicks that navigate between them
- [x] Denise will find out: *Do we need to work with VSP on these design concepts?*
- [x] Denise/Megan: Rough timing for when design prototypes will be ready?
- [ ] Cindy will consider combining this research with the Find a Form Downloading PDF research, if designs are ready at the same time

## Participants and Recruitment	
Ask Perigean to recruit 15 Veterans in order to get 8 completed sessions using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants
- At least 3 people who plan to use their computer for the session
- At least 3 people who plan to use their smartphone for the session
- At least 3 participants over 60
- At least 2 people with a cognitive disability (e.g., TBI)

### Good to have for participants
- At least 2 people of color
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 participant 35 or under
- At least 2 people who don't have any degree or vocational training after high school (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least 1 person that has a college degree (to include officer Veterans)
- At least 2 people who live in a rural or remote area
- At least 1 person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least 1 non-native English speaker

### Recruitment requirements for ALL participants
- Have a computer or smartphone and be willing to be complete their interview on one of those devices
- During the session, be willing to share a new web browser window on their device 
- Have a working microphone on their device
- Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen

### Additional questions to ask in the screener
- What kind of device will you be joining on and are willing to share a browser window on--computer or smartphone?
