This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on the following new design concepts for surfacing site search and other search tools:
1. A new search landing page that has links to other search tools (Find a Form, Resources & Support, and Find a VA Location)
1. A new link on the VA.gov home page under the "top 4" boxes that goes to the new search landing page
1. Search in the header as a link that goes to the new search landing page
1. New links at the bottom of the search results page go to other search tools

## Participants
We talked to **7** Veterans and showed them all the desktop version of the prototypes:
- 5 on a desktop/laptop computer 
- 2 on a tablet (iPad)

We wanted half of the participants to join via smartphone so they could test the mobile version of the prototypes, but none of the recruited mobile users showed up or used their phone for the session. We declined Perigean's offer to extend the research sessions beyond the allotted timeframe to try to recruit more mobile users. One of our pilot testers used a smartphone for the research session, so we have a bit of feedback from that one Veteran.

## Findings
1. All new design concepts were used by at least one particpant participant: 

Design Concept | # of Participants (out of 7) who used it
---------------|-----------------------------------------
Search tool links on new search landing page | 5
Search tool links on search results page | 4
Search link under the "top 4" boxes | 2 

1. Despite the new design concepts, 6 of 7 
2. 7 participants 
4. but all participants except one got stuck anyway.
