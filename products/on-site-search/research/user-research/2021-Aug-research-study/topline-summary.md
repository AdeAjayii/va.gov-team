This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on the following new design concepts for surfacing site search and other search tools:
1. A new search landing page that has links to other search tools (Find a Form, Resources & Support, and Find a VA Location)
1. A new link on the VA.gov home page under the "top 4" boxes that goes to the new search landing page
1. Search in the header as a link that goes to the new search landing page
1. New links at the bottom of the search results page go to other search tools

## Participants
We talked to **X** Veterans on a variety of devices:
- X on a desktop/laptop computer 
- 2 on a tablet (iPad)
- Z on an iPhone  

## Findings
