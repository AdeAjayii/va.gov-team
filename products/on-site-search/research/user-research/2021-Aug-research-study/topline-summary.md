This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on the following **4 new design concepts** for surfacing site search and other search tools:
1. A **new search landing page** that has links to other search tools (e.g., Find a VA Form, Resources & Support, and Find a VA Location)
1. A **new link** on the VA.gov home page **under the "top 4" boxes** that goes **to the new search landing page**
1. **Search in the header** as a link that **goes to the new search landing page**
1. **New links at the bottom of the search results page go to other search tools**

Participants were asked to do **3 tasks**:
1. In order to support your request for VA benefits, you want to submit a letter from someone who has first-hand knowledge of your condition or injury. You want to find the form for them to write the letter to support your claim. *(Site search doesn't return relevant results, but Find a VA Form does. This is top forms search #4--for form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.)*
1. Find out if there is a VA hospital in Knoxville, Tennessee. *(Site search doesn't return relevant results, but Find a VA location does.)*
1. See if you can get any college credit for your military service. *(Site search doesn't return relevant results, but Resources & Support does--article "How do I get college credits for my military service?")*

## Participants
We talked to **7 Veterans** and showed them all the desktop version of the prototypes:
- 5 on a desktop/laptop computer 
- 2 on a tablet (iPad)

We wanted half of the participants to join via smartphone so they could test the mobile version of the prototypes, but none of the recruited mobile users showed up or used their phone for the session. We declined Perigean's offer to extend the research sessions beyond the allotted timeframe to try to recruit more mobile users. One of our pilot testers used a smartphone for the research session, so we have a bit of feedback from that one Veteran.

## Findings
1. **All of the new design concepts were used** by at least 2 of 7 research participants to complete tasks (see table below). 
    1. Many participants didn't notice the search tool links on the search landing page at first because they were laser focused on finding a search box to use and didn't scroll down below it.
    1. Many participants didn't scroll down far enough on the search results page at first or ever to notice the search tool links at the bottom

Design Concept | # of Participants (of 7) who used it
---------------|-----------------------------------------
Search tool links on new search landing page | 5
Search link under the "top 4" boxes | 2
Search in header to search landing page | 6
Search tool links on search results page | 4


1. **Despite the new design concepts, some participants still got stuck.**
    1. All 7 participants went first to the "top 4" boxes, which unfortunately were not functional in the prototypes. No one went first to *Search*, but they all eventually did because they were unable to browse anywhere that helped.
    1. When search results didn't contain anything relevant, most participants wanted to refine their search query, which wasn't possible to do in the prototypes.
    1. 6 of 7 participants got stuck trying to do task 3, which required them to find and use *Resources and Support*. This was difficult because the name "Resources and Support" was perceived by participants as too general or vague to be useful. After repeated prompts from the moderator to see if they could find anything else to help, 3 of the 6 eventually tried *Resources and Support* and then were successful. 
    1. 2 of 7 participants got stuck in task 1; one of them eventually found *Find a VA Form* on the search results page. Successful participants found *Find a VA Form* on the search landing page (4 participants) or on the search results page (2).
1. All 7 participants were **successful with task 2, although all but one didn't use any of the new design concepts** in the prototypes. They found *Find a VA Location* in the header (3 participants), in the wide blue button farther down the home page (3), or at the bottom of the search results page (1).
1. **No participants expressed any surprise when the Search link in the header took them to the new search landing page**. They expected to see a search box, and that's exactly what they saw at the top of the search landing page.
1. 5 of 7 participants said that they **typically use Google to find VA information**, and several said that they would verify the results to make sure that they came from a VA website or could be confirmed there.
