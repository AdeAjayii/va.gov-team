# Research Goals

The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on new design concepts for surfacing site search and other search tools, namely, the following **4 new design concepts**:
1. A **new search landing page** that has links to other search tools (e.g., Find a VA Form, Resources & Support, and Find a VA Location)
1. A **new link** on the VA.gov home page **under the "top 4" boxes** that goes **to the new search landing page**
1. **Search in the header** as a link that **goes to the new search landing page**
1. **New links at the bottom of the search results page go to other search tools**

For each of the above design concepts, we wanted to assess *utility* (was it helpful to users and prevented them from getting stuck?) and *usability* (was it findable and intuitive?).

You can see screenshots of all of these design concepts in the [Pages and applications used section](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#Pages-and-applications-used) in the Appendix.

# Research Questions
1. Do users find and use the other search tools?
1. What are users' reactions to a landing page that highlights search tools? 
1. Do users try using the search tools from links on the landing page?  
1. What are users' reactions to Search in the header taking them to a landing page?
1. Do users try the new search link under the "top 4" boxes? What are users' reactions to it taking them to a landing page?
1. Do users notice the search tool links at the bottom of the search results page? Do they try using them? Reactions?
1. Are users able to complete tasks without getting stuck?

# Methodology 

We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on **September 10-17, 2021**. Participants were asked to do the following **3 tasks** using  prototypes in UXPin:
1. In order to support your request for VA benefits, you want to submit a letter from someone who has first-hand knowledge of your condition or injury. You want to find the form for them to write the letter to support your claim. *(Site search doesn't return relevant results, but Find a VA Form does. This is top forms search #4--for form 21-4138 Statement in Support of Claim.)*
1. Find out if there is a VA hospital in Knoxville, Tennessee. *(Site search doesn't return relevant results, but Find a VA location does.)*
1. See if you can get any college credit for your military service. *(Site search doesn't return relevant results, but Resources & Support does--article "How do I get college credits for my military service?")*

In the prototypes, site search leads only to unhelpful search results (as it does today in Production for each of the above search tasks, which is why we selected them). We wanted to see what participants would do and whether they would find and try one of the other search tools. We built a separate prototype for each task so that search query and search results shown could be different.
 
We wanted half of the participants to join via smartphone so they could test the mobile version of the prototypes, but none of the recruited mobile users showed up and used their phone for the session. We declined Perigean's offer to extend the research sessions beyond the allotted timeframe to try to recruit more mobile users. One of our pilot testers used a smartphone for the research session, so we have a bit of feedback from that one Veteran, though most of the findings described in this report are from only the desktop version of the prototypes.

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. A search *landing* page that highlights other search tools will result in more users using the search tools and finding what they're looking for.
1. A search *results* page that highlights other search tools will result in more users using the search tools and finding what they're looking for.
1. New search link(s) near the "top 4" boxes will result in more users finding what they're looking for.
    1. FALSE: 

# Key Findings

ASSESS utility (was it helpful to users and prevented them from getting stuck?) and usability (was it findable and intuitive?) for each of the above design concepts.

1. **All of the new design concepts were used** by at least 2 of 7 research participants to complete tasks. 
  
1. **Despite the new design concepts, some participants still got stuck.**
1. All 7 participants were **successful with task 2, although all but one didn't use any of the new design concepts** in the prototypes. They found *Find a VA Location* in the header (3 participants), in the wide blue button farther down the home page (3), or at the bottom of the search results page (1).
1. **No participants expressed any surprise when the Search link in the header took them to the new search landing page**. They expected to see a search box, and that's exactly what they saw at the top of the search landing page.
1. Most (5 of 7) participants said that they **typically use Google to find VA information**, and several said that they would verify the results to make sure that they came from a VA website or could be confirmed there.



# Details of Findings 

## 

### 1. 
1. **All of the new design concepts were used** by at least 2 of 7 research participants to complete tasks (see table below). 
    1. Many participants didn't notice the search tool links on the search landing page at first because they were laser focused on finding a search box to use and didn't scroll down below it.
    1. Many participants didn't scroll down far enough on the search results page at first or ever to notice the search tool links at the bottom

Design Concept | # of Participants (of 7) who used it
---------------|-----------------------------------------
Search tool links on new search landing page | 5
Search link under the "top 4" boxes | 2
Search in header to search landing page | 6
Search tool links on search results page | 4

Keywords: 

1. **Despite the new design concepts, some participants still got stuck.**
    1. All 7 participants went first to the "top 4" boxes, which unfortunately were not functional in the prototypes. No one went first to *Search*, but they all eventually did because they were unable to browse anywhere that helped.
    1. When search results didn't contain anything relevant, most participants wanted to refine their search query, which wasn't possible to do in the prototypes.
    1. 6 of 7 participants got stuck trying to do task 3, which required them to find and use *Resources and Support*. This was difficult because the name "Resources and Support" was perceived by participants as too general or vague to be useful. After repeated prompts from the moderator to see if they could find anything else to help, 3 of the 6 eventually tried *Resources and Support* and then were successful. 
    1. 2 of 7 participants got stuck in task 1; one of them eventually found *Find a VA Form* on the search results page. Successful participants found *Find a VA Form* on the search landing page (4 participants) or on the search results page (2).
1. All 7 participants were **successful with task 2, although all but one didn't use any of the new design concepts** in the prototypes. They found *Find a VA Location* in the header (3 participants), in the wide blue button farther down the home page (3), or at the bottom of the search results page (1).
1. **No participants expressed any surprise when the Search link in the header took them to the new search landing page**. Some participants were asked what they would expect when they clicked on search in the header, and they said they expected to see a search box. When the search landing page opened with a search box at the top, we didn't observe any surprised reactions or hear any comments from any of the participants, regardless of whether they had been asked about their expectations before they clicked.
1. Most (5 of 7) participants said that they **typically use Google to find VA information**, and several said that they would verify the results to make sure that they came from a VA website or could be confirmed there.

# Next Steps

Share findings and recommendations with the Search & Discovery team. 


# Further research needed

After some or all of the design concepts have been launched, we should look at the analytics and assess the actual usage of the new links.
