# Research Goals

The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on new design concepts for surfacing site search and other search tools, namely, the following **4 new design concepts**:
1. A **new search landing page** that has links to other search tools (e.g., Find a VA Form, Resources & Support, and Find a VA Location)
1. A **new link** on the VA.gov home page **under the "top 4" boxes** that goes **to the new search landing page**
1. **Search in the header** as a link that **goes to the new search landing page**
1. **New links at the bottom of the search results page** that go to other search tools

For each of the above design concepts, we wanted to assess *utility* (was it helpful to users in preventing them from getting stuck?) and *usability* (was it findable and intuitive?).

You can see screenshots of all of these design concepts in the [Pages and applications used section](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/research-findings.md#Pages-and-applications-used) in the Appendix.

# Research Questions
1. Do users find and use the other search tools?
1. What are users' reactions to a landing page that highlights search tools? 
1. Do users try using the search tools from links on the landing page?  
1. What are users' reactions to *Search* in the header taking them to a landing page?
1. Do users try the new search link under the "top 4" boxes? What are users' reactions to it taking them to a landing page?
1. Do users notice the search tool links at the bottom of the search results page? Do they try using them? Reactions?
1. Are users able to complete tasks without getting stuck?

# Methodology 

We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on **September 10-17, 2021**. Participants were asked to do the following **3 tasks** using  prototypes in UXPin:

Task # | Task Goal | Site Search | Search Tool that Helps 
---------------|-----------------------------------------| ------------------- | ------------
1 | Find form for letter for someone to support your claim | No relevant results | Find a VA Form (form 21-4138)
2 | Find out if there's a VA hospital in Knoxville, TN | No relevant results | Find a VA Location
3 | See if you can get college credit for military service | No relevant results | Resources and Support

In the prototypes, site search leads only to unhelpful search results (as it does today in Production for each of the above search tasks, which is why we selected them). We wanted to see what participants would do and whether they would find and try one of the other search tools. We built a separate prototype for each task so that search query and search results shown could be different.
 
We wanted half of the participants to join via smartphone so they could test the mobile version of the prototypes, but none of the recruited mobile users showed up and used their phone for the session. We declined Perigean's offer to extend the research sessions beyond the allotted timeframe in order to try to recruit more mobile users. One of our pilot testers used a smartphone for the research session, so we have a bit of feedback from that one Veteran, though most of the findings described in this report are only from the desktop version of the prototypes.

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. A search *landing* page that highlights other search tools will result in more users using the search tools and finding what they're looking for.
    1. TRUE: 5 of 7 participants used the search tools on the landing page to successfully complete tasks.
2. A search *results* page that highlights other search tools will result in more users using the search tools and finding what they're looking for.
    1. TRUE: 4 of 7 participants used the search tools on the search results page to successfully complete tasks.
4. A new search link near the "top 4" boxes will result in more users finding what they're looking for.
    1. TRUE: 2 of 7 participants used the new search link under the "top 4" boxes to successfully complete tasks.

# Key Findings

1. **All of the new design concepts were used by multiple participants** to complete tasks, though there were a few usability issues. 
  
1. **Despite the new design concepts, some participants still got stuck**.

1. **Using different search tools on different pages is confusing** (i.e., VA.gov site search, Find a VA Form, Resources and Support).

1. **Most participants preferred to browse VA.gov web pages first, before searching**.

1. Most participants said that they **typically use Google to find VA information**.


# Details of Findings 

## 1. All of the new design concepts were used by multiple participants to complete tasks, though there were a few usability issues
The table below summarizes participants' usage of each of the design concepts to complete tasks, and the primary usability issues with each. Further discussion of each design concept and the associated usability issues can be found below the table.

Design Concept | # of Participants (of 7) who used it | Usability Issues
---------------|-----------------------------------------| -------------------
Search tool links on new search landing page | 5 | Didn't look at other links because focused on search box at top (4 people). Low-color contrast between light gray of tiles on white background (1 person).
Search link under the "top 4" boxes | 2 | Didn't notice under "top 4" boxes (4 people)
Search in header to search landing page | 6 | Didn't notice in header (1 person)
Search tool links on search results page | 4 | Didn't scroll down far enough to see (4 people)

### Search tool links on new search landing page
- At first, 4 of 7 participants didn't notice the search tool links on the search landing page because they were laser focused on finding a search box to use. Since the search box is what they were looking for, most participants didn't scroll down below it. Only one participant scrolled down and looked at everything on the landing page before going back up to type into the search box.

> "You get locked in and focused because you're focused on a specific task" (p8).

- 1 of the above 4 participants said that they missed the search tool links because of their light gray colored boxes on a white background. They recommended adding more color contrast, like the visual design of the "top 4" boxes on the home page (white on a bright blue background).

- Another factor in the visibility of the search tools on the landing page is the participant's device and screen resolution, which affects how much of the search tool tiles are shown without scrolling. Depending on how much you see, you may or may not think to scroll. Some people may benefit from some visual indication that there's something below to scroll to, which a partially visible box may indicate.
> "I think to scroll, but I tend to zone in on what I'm seeing" and then not scroll to explore more of the page (p8).
  - A mobile user (our second pilot participant) couldn't see any of the search tools below the search box, so they had no indication that anything was below the search box. In contrast, the moderator's phone shows the top half of the first search tool box (Find a VA Form), which suggests that scrolling might be useful.
  - Participants' computer resolution varied in that some showed most of the search tools without scrolling, while one that was particularly low resolution showed only the top of the top two tiles. You can see both below.

![p16-landing-pg-see-most](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/2021-Aug-research-study/images/p16-landing-pg-see-most.png)

### Search link under the "top 4" boxes
- 4 participants didn't appear to notice the "Can't find what you're looking for? Search VA.gov" link under the "top 4" boxes. 
- 1 person mentioned it but said they didn't try it because they expected it to do the same thing as *Search* in the header where they already clicked.
- 1 person who used this link assumed that *Search* in the header would do the same thing (which is correct).
- Participants' screen resolution may be a factor here, too. Our mobile user (pilot participant) didn't see the link in their phone because they didn't scroll down below the "top 4" boxes.


### Search in header to search landing page
- 6 of 7 participants used the *Search* link in the header. 1 participant didn't notice it at all.
- **No participants expressed any surprise when the *Search* link in the header took them to the new search landing page.** Some participants were asked what they thought would happen when they clicked on *Search*, and they said they expected to see a search box. When the search landing page opened with a search box at the top, we didn't observe any surprised reactions or hear any complaints from any of the participants, regardless of whether they had been asked about their expectations before they clicked.

### Search tool links on search results page
- 4 participants didn't scroll down far enough on the search results page at first or ever to notice the search tool links at the bottom. To see the search tool links, they needed to scroll down below the numbered links to the subsequent pages of search results, which these participants didn't do.  
- When one participant finally scrolled down far enough to see the links, they exclaimed
> "Oh wow, that's cool!" (p1)
- Another participant who noticed the search tool links at the end of the session said that they overlooked them before because they weren't looking for anything but search results. They thought it would be better if the tools could be "more in your face" (p8) on the right of the search results and scroll down with you.  Having tool links to the right of the search results list sounds like the "right rail" design that was previously user tested and is not going to be used going forward. 

## 2. Despite the new design concepts, some participants still got stuck
- Participants assumed that what they were looking for would be in the search results, and when they didn't find it there, some seemed frustrated. When searching for "college credit", two participants specifically called out the search result "Lenders Page - VA Home Loans" as completely irrelevant, which led one of them to assume it was an ad.
> "I couldn’t find what I was looking for” (p16).

> "Oh, it seems like search doesn't work" (p13).

- Some participants judged the quality of the search results based on the number of results returned, and they expected to find what they're looking for in the first page or two of search results.
> 1 participant commented that having only 14 search results from *Find a VA Form* instead of 999 from site search "tells me that I'm getting closer to what I'm looking for" (p2).

- When search results didn't contain anything relevant, most participants wanted to refine their search query, which wasn't possible to do in the prototypes.
- 6 of 7 participants got stuck trying to do task 3, which required them to find and use *Resources and Support*. The name "Resources and Support" was interpreted by participants as too general or vague to be useful. They were looking specifically for education-related content. After repeated prompts from the moderator to see if they could find anything else to help, 3 of the 6 eventually tried *Resources and Support* and then were successful with the task. 
- 2 of 7 participants got stuck in task 1; one of them eventually found *Find a VA Form* on the search results page. Successful participants found *Find a VA Form* on the search landing page (4 participants) or on the search results page (2 participants).
- All 7 participants were successful with task 2, although all but one didn't use any of the new design concepts in the prototypes. They found *Find a VA Location* in the header (3 participants), in the wide blue button farther down the home page (3 participants), or at the bottom of the search results page (1 participant).
  - 1 participant who missed *Find a VA Location* in the header but saw it later recommended moving it to the left of *About VA* because it was more specific than *About VA*.
- When participants got stuck during their research sessions, 3 of them said that they would try to contact someone via phone or the "ask a question online" link that 2 of them found.

## 3. Using different search tools on different pages is confusing (i.e., VA.gov site search, Find a VA Form, Resources and Support)
- 3 participants said that it was confusing to go to different pages to use different search tools, and that it would be simpler if they all were in one place. 2 of them also said that they didn't want to have to load a separate page for each tool on the search landing page, given the slowness of their Internet connections. Their ideas included radio buttons underneath the search box or a dropdown when you clicked *Search* on the home page in order to select what you want to search.
> "It would be helpful if everything is consolidated onto one page” (p13).

- Participants had differing opinions about what content they were searching:
  - 3 thought that everything in *Find a VA Form* and *Resources and Support* would also be in the general site search results but maybe not in the top page of them. Using the current VA.gov site search, the *Resources and Support article* "How do I get college credits for my military service?" is on the fourth (!) page of results.
> "Maybe that result is on page 2 or 3, but the odds of me going there are slim" (p5).

  - 1 participant expected *Find a VA Form* and *Resources and Support* results to *not* be in the general site search.
  - 1 participant trusted *Find a VA Form* to be an exhaustive list of all forms, which was preferable than having to get the exact name of the form correct to find it using the site search.

## 4. Most participants preferred to browse VA.gov web pages first, before searching
- All 7 participants went first to the "top 4" boxes, which unfortunately were not functional in the prototypes. No one went to *Search* first, but all eventually did because they were unable to browse anywhere that helped. If the links in the "top 4" boxes and in the topics below the row of pictures had worked in the prototype, perhaps fewer participants would have tried search.
- 3 participants then tried *VA Benefits and Health Care*, which also wasn't functional in the prototype.
- When participants navigated to a page containing a search box at the top (i.e., search landing page, Find a VA Form, and Resources and Support), 3 of the 7 scrolled down to look at everything on the page before going back up to the top to type into the search box. One of these participants also scrolled slowly through the entire VA.gov home page and the two content pages that were active links in the search results--they said that they always read the entire web page before interacting.

## 5. Most participants said that they typically use Google to find VA information
- 5 of 7 participants said that when they are looking or information about VA benefits, they go first to Google. Several participants said that they verify what they find to make sure that it came from a VA website or could be confirmed there. 
- One participant who got stuck said that they would go to Google instead of trying VA.gov again because Google searches more websites. 
- Search on VA.gov returns a lot of irrelevant results, and so many Veterans have learned to look elsewhere first.
> "If I had more success finding information on VA.gov, I might go directly there. Because I have so much success on google, I just go there now" (p13).


# Additional Insights: 

1. Three participants said that they didn't understand what *Resources and Support* meant and so didn't click on it. The word "FAQs" in the description in the *Resources and Support* tile is what led to some of them eventually try it.
> "Might be anything, information I already know, things I don't need to do, might be about claims, will have information about everything" (p1).

> Because it's at the very bottom of the page [in the footer], it seems like "a last resort instead of what I should go to first" (p5).
2. There was some hesitation about using *Find a VA Form* if they didn't know the form number (1 participant) or the proper name of the form (another participant). The first participant was looking for the form number in various content pages. Here's a quote from the second participant: 
> “I guess here I am stuck because I don’t know what the form is called, so I don’t know what to search for” (p16).

> "It's a hunt--crazy to figure out what words are needed" (p15).

3. When looking for an education home page, 2 participants tried to click on the "Education" header in the "top 4" Education box. Another participant thought that the "Education and Training" link below the pictures might help.

# Recommendations

## For the Search & Discovery team
1. **Consider consolidating all the search tools into the main site search interface**. In this way, there could be a single search box, possibly with radio buttons or checkboxes to select what to search (i.e., VA.gov, VA forms, Resources/FAQs). This would eliminate the confusion about other search tools to try and where to find them. We could seamlessly combine the search results from site search, Find a VA Form, and Resources & Support into one list for Veterans to see.
1. **If we don't implement the previous recommendation, then consider implementing *all 4* of the design concepts** because each helped multiple participants to complete tasks and avoid getting stuck. Consider the following design ideas that may improve the usability of these design concepts:
    1. On the search results page, try positioning the search tool links higher up on the page or adding a visual indication that there's something below the page navigation to see.
    1. On the search landing page, try adding a visual indication that there's something below the search box to see.
        1. Or, add radio buttons directly underneath the search box to select all of VA.gov, Find a VA Form, or Resources & Support so separate links aren't needed.
    1. For the "Can't find what you're looking for?" link, try making it stand out more visually. This might be done by putting it inside a box or inside *each* of the "top 4" boxes (since that's where people are already looking).
1. **Work with the Search.gov team to try to get more relevant search results**, which may include searching only the main content of each page and not the side links, related links, header, and footer. We should also make sure that all *Find a VA Form* and *Resources and Support* content is included in the search.gov results. If we succeed at getting more relevant results from Search.gov, we might want to...
    1. Communicate the improvement to Veterans so they'll try it again and see for themselves that it has improved and thus is worth using.
    2. Limit the number of results returned so it's not frequently "999" (which suggests an ineffective search that returned too much). 
    3. Make the search link in the header more visible/prominent so more Veterans will notice it.
1. Since so many people get to VA.gov through Google, see if we can **improve the Google search path by improving metadata on VA content pages**.
1. Consider renaming _Resources and Support_ to "FAQs" because this is a more widely used term that users understand.
> "I think FAQs are really helpful if it is an exhaustive list” (p5).

## For other teams
1. Consider adding "Resources" to the header next to "Find VA Location" to enable more Veterans to find it.
1. Consider making the headers in the "top 4" boxes into links (e.g., "Education" could go to the [VA education and training benefits page](https://www.va.gov/education/) page) because that's where many Veterans look first.

# Next Steps

The Search & Discovery team will be moving forward on trying to consolidate all the search tools into the main site search interface (recommendation #1) and will be adding *Resources and Support*, *Find a VA Form*, and other search tools to their scope.


# Further research needed

If any new design concepts get launched, we should look at the analytics and assess the actual usage of the new links. Look especially at the usage of mobile users since they weren't included in this research.
