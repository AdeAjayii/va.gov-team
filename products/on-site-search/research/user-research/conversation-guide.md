# Conversation Guide for Search & Discovery
-- DRAFT --
## Intro
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Megan. I also have some colleagues on the line listening and taking notes. Today we'll be talking about VA.gov’s search feature. We're trying to learn about veteran’s experiences finding VA related information.
Before we get started, I want to give you an idea of what this call will be like:
- This entire session should take about 50 minutes.
- This session is going to resemble an interview where I will ask you many questions about your experience with finding VA-related information. There are no right or wrong answers, this is purely to understand actual client experiences. If at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can move on to the next question.
- Later, I'll ask that you share your screen while you find certain items on VA.gov.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing you, instead we are testing our products and services to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- This session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after the call is analyzed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- If yes: Once I start recording, I will ask again to confirm that you're ok with me recording this session so that it's captured in the recording.
Start recording to the Cloud
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"

## Warmup
- To get us started can you tell me briefly about your service history?
- Are you currently receiving benefits from the VA?


## Past Experience
- Can you tell me about a time recently when you were looking for information related to federal VA benefits? What were you looking for and how did you try to find that information? 
- Were you successful in finding what you were looking for? 
- What could have been better about this experience?

## VA.gov screensharing 

- I’m going to send you a link and ask that you share your screen.

[screen sharing instructions] 

- Send link to staging.va.gov
- [If they haven't mentioned VA.gov]Are you familiar with this site? [If yes] Can you tell me about the last time you used this site?
- Can you show me how you would go about finding more information about [education] benefits? (replace education with what the participant has mentioned previously)
    - [If they cannot think of anything to look up] Just as an example, if you were wondering if you were eligible for dental benefits, how would you locate that information?

- [When participant uses search and they are on the search results page:]

  - Walk me through what you’re seeing on this page.
  - What could make this page easier to use or read?
  - Would you prefer to filter or refine search results in some way? By location? Category?
  - How many results do you typically look at?
  - What made you click on that specific link?
  
- If you were looking for a specific form, form 10-10EZ, how would you locate it on this site?

  
## Post-task Interview 

- What was your overall experience with VA search like?
- What worked well? 
- Would you change anything?

Those are all the questions that I had for you today.
- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?
