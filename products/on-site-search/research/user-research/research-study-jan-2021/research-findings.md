Prepared by: Megan Gayle, Search & Discovery

[Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/research-plan.md)

## Research Goals 

The goal of this research was to understand users expectations for search, including the following:

- how users find information outside of VA.gov
- when users utilize VA.gov search
- pain points related to search
- do users utilize 'more VA search tools' and other search utilities 
- what advanced features users expect and utilize from search

## Research Methodology 

A task-based remote, moderated usability study was conducted via Zoom and GoToMeeting between January 27 - February 8, 2021. A moderator began with introduction questions about past experiences and prompted users with questions (from the conversation guide). Participants were encouraged to talk through their exploration of global search and other search features (Find a Form and Find a Facility) on staging.va.gov. Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance.

### Who we talked to
[Participants requested compared to participants tested](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/on-site-search/research/user-research/research-study-jan-2021/participants.md)

- 9 Veterans 
- 1 Service Member
  - Geography
    - 7 rural
    - 3 urban
  - Education
    - 5 with High School or GED
  - Ages varied 25-74 years of age (exact data unknown)
  - 6 participants with identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities
  - 8 men, 2 women
  - 4 non-white participants
  
### Technology

- 1 on Tablet

### Benefit Hubs
 - 3 had looked for education benefits
 - 2 had looked for health benefits
 - 2 had looked for disability benefits
 - 1 had looked for family benefits
 - 2 had looked for burial benefits


### Research Questions

- Where do users look for information if they don't find it via VA.gov search?
- In what scenarios do users use VA.gov search?
- What, if any, pain points do users experience when using search?
- How effective is VA.gov's search tool at providing the information people are seeking?
    - relevancy
    - scanning behavior (can we improve heirarchy/design?)
    - best bets "Top Recommendations"
    - advanced search features (typeahead/filters)
- Do people utilize or see “More VA search tools”?

## Key Findings

1. Most began their journey in looking for information on eBenefits and VA.gov.
2. When asked to look for information on VA.gov, most participants did not immediately utilize the search feature.
3. Most participants only looked at the first few results, focusing on the keywords in the titles. They were not always shown relevent results for their search terms. 
4. Most participants did not click on a typeahead suggestion. 6 out of 10 said they would like to filter results in some way.
5. Most participants did not see the right rail with "More VA search tools" because of browser width/mobile use. Most were able to find "Find a Facilty" located on the header of VA.gov.

## Details of Findings

**1. Most began their journey in looking for information on eBenefits and VA.gov.** Most participants mentioned looking on eBenefits and VA.gov and a few expressed frustration over having to switch between the two sites. Other sites mentioned were: Google, Blogs, Reddit, Facebook Groups. A current service member mentioned asking other military members about benefits available to him. A few veterans mentioned calling the VA. 

**2. When asked to look for information on VA.gov, most participants did not immediately utilize the search feature.** When asked to look for more information related to a benefit they were receiving, most participants either went to the dropdown navigation or scanned the links on the homepage. 

**3. Most participants only looked at the first few results, focusing on the keywords in the titles. They were not always shown relevent results for their search terms.** 

**4. Most participants did not click on a typeahead suggestion. 6 out of 10 said they would like to filter results in some way.** 

**5. Most participants did not see the right rail with "More VA search tools" because of browser width/mobile use. Most were able to find "Find a Facilty" located on the header of VA.gov.** 


## Additional Insights

- Veterans who have been out of the military might have issues finding information on VA.gov due to "military jargon". 


## Recommendations
- Include Caregivers, Family Members, and more Veterans who have been out of the military for 10+ years to find further pain points related to "military jargon".


## Next Steps

### Update search results page
- Implement design recommendations 
- Make improvements to "More VA Search tools" right rail
- Look into ways of increasing relevancy on search results
  - Increase Best Bets ("Top Recommendation") usage
  - Work with Search.gov to help improve relevancy

### Look into when users reach a point where they call for help
- Get a better understanding of how/when Veterans and Caregivers reach out for help outside of finding information on VA.gov.
