## Research review goals

### Determine what we already know

This includes:

- Challenges with navigating the logged in experience that we're already well aware of (eg. people being reliant on homepage and My VA links).
- Veteran top tasks that we've already seen demonstrated through research and analytics that we don't need to rehash (eg. health care and claims are the most popular tasks/tools on the site).
- Known expectations around the logged in experience (eg. people expect it to be personalized).

### Determine what we need more information on

This includes:

- Documenting any initial findings that maybe show in one or two reports, but on which we'd like to gather more information.
- Determining where we still have outstanding questions that have not been covered in any previous research.
