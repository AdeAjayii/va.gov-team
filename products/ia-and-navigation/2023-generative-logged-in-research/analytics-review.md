2/26/2023

For comparing logged in vs. logged out users, I used the following custom segments:
- VA.gov - Session - Authenticated - LOA Present
- VA.gov - Session - No LOA Present [Veteran Not Logged In]

## Signing in to VA.gov
* What percentage of users sign in to VA.gov over the last year (2/22-2/23?
	* 10.87%
* What are the top ten popular pages for people to sign in on? ([View Google Sheets export](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10LxJE3j8SCBi8aNL0RaC4wdLGVqwSpuvLDmc3jB1EsU/edit?usp=sharing))

* How many clicks do people usually take/pages do people usually visit before signing in?
	*  Not sure how to figure this one out.
* What are peoples’ next clicks **after** signing in?
	* Behavior flow report?
* What is the % breakdown of people who click sign in CTAs vs. “Create Account” CTAs?

| Event Label      | Total Events |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|register-link-clicked-[logingov or idme] | 1,030,721 (0.04%)|

## Navigating to tasks & tools
* What is the breakdown of:
	* Most popular pages overall (**Note**: I know we already know a lot about top tasks, so this is more for reiteration/context setting)
	* Most popular landing pages
	* Most popular pages visited while signed in
	* Most popular pages visited while signed out

* What are the average number of pages visited on the site in a session?
	* Logged in: 16.95
	* Logged out: 3.53
Logged-in users have much longer session durations than logged out: 15:49 compared to 3:08. Logged-in users also have significantly lower bounce rates: .03% compared to 36.78%

* For the [top ten?] most popular logged in tasks, how many clicks/page visits does it take for people to get to those pages?
* For the [top ten?] most popular logged in tasks, what are the top previous pages?

## Search
* Top search terms
* How often is search used/search button clicked? (Search.gov might need to help us)
* How often are people clicking best bets for search (especially if task-related)?
