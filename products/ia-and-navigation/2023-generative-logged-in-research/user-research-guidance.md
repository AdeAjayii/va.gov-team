# User research guidance

Given that I (Samara) will likely be out as this research is planned and happens, this is some guidance on how to create a research plan that gets at what we are hoping to capture in this research.

**That being said, Mikki and Chante should also co-sign on this to make sure that we are in alignment**.

## Research goals

### Primary

Identify problems with navigating the logged-in experience on VA.gov.

### Secondary

If possible, it would be helpful to note/capture the following:

- What prompts people to sign-in to the site (eg. do they do it right away? do they wait until they get to a content page with a sign in prompt? do they use the sign in button in the main nav, or on the homepage?)
- Does the homepage need to exist when users are logged-in? Can My VA replace it?
- Is there confusion among the homepage vs. My VA vs. the new health hub landing page (note: there is going to be work done on the health apartment team specifically targeting this question, but if you happen to observe anything that could give us insight or be useful to that team, it's worth noting).

## Methods

- Please test using the actual website. We should not need a prototype for this.
- Please test using whatever version of the website shows both the new homepage AND the new health landing page (tbh, I don't know if these will actually be available at the same URL). I belive the new health landing page is supposed to go live mid-March.
- We've talked about *not* starting people on the website, but they'll obviously need to get there eventually so we can evaluate the navigation. So, where you start people is up to you, but we'll need to make sure to eventually guide them to VA.gov if we opt to start them on a blank browser.
- Once people are on the website, I'm sure they will rely on the homepage or My VA to get around, and that's fine if someone says they'd click a link relevant to a particular task. However, we're not here to test links on the homepage or My VA, and we already know people overly rely on these to get around. So, I think if there is a task where someone says they'd just click a link on the homepage or My VA, we should also ask them to demonstrate how they'd do the same thing if they were not allowed to use My VA or the homepage (ie. how would they use the nav/search?).
