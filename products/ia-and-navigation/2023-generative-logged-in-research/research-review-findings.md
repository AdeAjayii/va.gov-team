## Signing in to VA.gov
### When do people sign in to VA.gov? 
### Do they intend to sign in first thing, or only after finding a page that tells them they need to sign in?
### Are people able to find prompts to sign in easily?
	
## Navigating to tasks & tools
### What are the known challenges do people have navigating the logged in experience (eg. reliance on homepage/My VA links)?
1. People get frustrated navigating links that are not relevant to them, or feel like the website is generic vs personalized to them.
	- [My VA 2.0 2020 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#people-want-a-task-based-logged-in-homepage-tailored-to-them)
	- [Action items discovery, finding 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md#key-findings)
2. There is some ambiguity/confusion around navigating things related to financial information
	- 	[Health Hub Tree Test Finding 5](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf) reveals that navigating things related to financial information is somewhat confusing. Identifying where and why cost, debt, and payment related content and tools was difficult, and there were multiple instances of confusion as to why copay and travel reimbursement were together.
	- In the [Mobile App Open Card Sort study (finding 5)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-sort-research-report.md), people created a payment category that include all financial things *except* anything related to Education benefits - they wanted those to stay separately.  
3. People have to reorient themselves on the homepage, since there isn’t a cohesive logged-in navigation.
	- [My VA 2.0 2020 Analytics Review](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#most-people-start-directly-on-the-homepage-but-some-people-reorient-themselves-their-throughout-their-session)
			
### How easy/hard is it to find tasks that require people to be logged in?
1. People are easily able to find tasks that require people to be logged in when:
- they are linked from the homepage or My VA
- They have succinct labels
	- [Health Hub Tree Test Finding 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf)	
- There is scannable list of sections and tools, such as in the blue sky prototype sidebar navigation
	- [My VA 2.0 2020 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#the-homepage-needs-to-be-supported-by-a-cohesive-logged-in-navigation)

2. It’s harder for people to understand labels that are overly verbose or break to multiple lines.
	- Example: “Manage your electronic record sharing options,” 
	- [Health Hub Tree Test Finding 3](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf)	


### What tasks do people come to complete?
**Note:** We already know disability and health care info are primary, so probably worth reiterating and moving on quickly.
- Health care and disability tasks are most popular.  
	- [My VA 2.0 2020 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#health-care-and-disability-benefits-are-king)
- People also want to see information about their active benefits.
	- 	[My VA 2.0 2020 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#health-care-and-disability-benefits-are-king)
- Downloading or looking for documents 
	- [My VA 2.0 2020 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#records-and-documents-are-a-focus-for-veterans)
- Depending on where the Veteran is in the Veteran journey, they find different services important.
	- [Mobile App Open Card Sort, Finding 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/va-mobile-app/ux-research/information-architecture/open%20card%20sort/Card-sort-research-report.md)


### What are other known insights around navigating the site overall?
1. People will want information about getting benefits (vs managing) regardless of if they are logged in or not.
	- Mission-critical “Get Benefits” content would benefit from multiple paths, elevation in the IA, and more direct navigation
		- [Health Hub Tree Test Finding 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf)	
	- The logged-in homepage needs to scale to support all phases of the Veteran lifecycle
		- [My VA 2.0 2020 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#the-logged-in-homepage-needs-to-scale-to-support-every-phase-of-the-veteran-lifecycle)
2. It’s important to have a clear delineation between tasks around “get benefits” and “managing benefits”.
	-  [Health Hub Tree Test Recommendations](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf)	
3. Users want multiple ways of getting to the same information.

	- [My VA 2.0 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#veterans-want-new-information-to-be-clear-to-them-when-they-log-in-and-expect-to-receive-new-information-through-multiple-channels)
	- [Action items discovery, Central Alerts finding 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md#central-alerts-page-1)

4. Visual indicators, such as a red dot for alerts, combined with clear labeling make it easy for people to understand something needs their attention.
	- [Action items discovery, Central Alerts finding 1](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md#central-alerts-page-1)



### What are other known insights around navigating the logged in experience/tasks you have to log into to do?
1. People find it helpful to have all their tasks/links in one place, and when they log in. 
	- [Action items discovery, finding 1 and 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md#key-findings)
	- In the [My VA 2.0 2020 Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#veterans-expect-a-mix-of-links-and-widgets-to-complete-tasks-from-their-homepage) we heard that people don’t mind a bunch of links if they take them to the right place
2. It’s not intuitive for people to look under something called “My” for things they don’t have yet
> While “My Health” provided an intuitive go-to location for “Manage” tasks, it was often not considered for “Get” content and tasks - [Health Hub Tree Test Finding 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf)

	


### What do we not know at this point? 

### What would be helpful to get more information on?
> “I rely on a good search box. HC has so many shades of gray which makes it difficult”
- Quote from the [Health Hub Tree Test Finding 2](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/mhv-to-va.gov/overall-content-IA/2022-07-health-apt-tree-test-round1/HH_ResearchFindings.pdf); how important is search to navigation? Do people have different expectations around search when they’re logged in vs not?
