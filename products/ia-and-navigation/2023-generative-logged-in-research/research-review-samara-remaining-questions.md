# Samara's remaining questions coming out of Liz's research review

[Research review findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/research-review-findings.md)

## Signing in

While there was some evidence of the following in previous research, we should find additional supporting or refuting evidence of the following:

- When people login in a given flow (eg. right away, after finding a prompt in a content page, etc).
- What sign in CTA people use (homepage, content page, main nav), and how easily they find these prompts.
- Whether "sign in" or "create an account" makes a difference.

## Navigating to tasks & tools

> People get frustrated navigating links that are not relevant to them, or feel like the website is generic rather than personalized to them.

- Is this only when people are logged-in (assuming yes)? What level of personalization do they expect in the navigation?

> It’s hard for people to find what they need if it’s not on the homepage.

- If people can not use My VA or the homepage, how could we improve the navigation to help them find what they need?

> In the second round of the homepage redesign usability research, participants commented on how hard it was to find links in a long page of content ([Citation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/research-review-findings.md#how-easyhard-is-it-to-find-tasks-that-require-people-to-be-logged-in))

- Is the problem with navigation the main nav, lengthy content pages (assume CTA is not on My VA or homepage), or both (or something else)?
