# Samara's remaining questions coming out of Liz's research review

[Research review findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/research-review-findings.md)

## Signing in

While there was some evidence of the following in previous research, we should find additional supporting or refuting evidence of the following:

- When people login in a given flow (eg. right away, after finding a prompt in a content page, etc).
- What sign in CTA people use (homepage, content page, main nav), and how easily they find these prompts.
- Whether "sign in" or "create an account" makes a difference.

## Navigating to tasks & tools

> People get frustrated navigating links that are not relevant to them, or feel like the website is generic rather than personalized to them. ([Citation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/research-review-findings.md#what-are-the-known-challenges-do-people-have-navigating-the-logged-in-experience-eg-reliance-on-homepagemy-va-links))

- Is this only when people are logged-in (assuming yes)? What level of personalization do they expect in the navigation?

> It’s hard for people to find what they need if it’s not on the homepage. ([Citation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/research-review-findings.md#what-are-the-known-challenges-do-people-have-navigating-the-logged-in-experience-eg-reliance-on-homepagemy-va-links))

- If people can not use My VA or the homepage, how could we improve the navigation to help them find what they need?

> In the second round of the homepage redesign usability research, participants commented on how hard it was to find links in a long page of content ([Citation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/research-review-findings.md#how-easyhard-is-it-to-find-tasks-that-require-people-to-be-logged-in))

- Is the problem with navigation the main nav, lengthy content pages (assume CTA is not on My VA or homepage), or both (or something else)?

> It’s important to have a clear delineation between tasks around “getting benefits” and “managing benefits”. ([Citation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/research-review-findings.md#what-are-other-known-insights-around-navigating-the-site-overall))

- Does this hold up when we add the layer of a visual navigation on top of a tree test? Is the delineation about "Get" and "Manage", or something else?

> Visual indicators, such as a red dot for alerts, combined with clear labeling make it easy for people to understand something needs their attention. ([Citation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/research-review-findings.md#what-are-other-known-insights-around-navigating-the-site-overall))

- What other wayfinding methods besides navigational terms should we consider?

> The mobile app IA (which is similar to VA.gov) is easy and intuitive for people to navigate and learn, even when they’re brand-new to the app. ([Citation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/research-review-findings.md#what-are-other-known-insights-around-navigating-the-site-overall))

- Is using the mobile app nav as a model for VA.gov a good idea? Given the inherent difference in these mediums, where is the line between how they should be similar and how they should and need to differ?

## User types

- How do needs and expectations around moving through VA.gov differ between user types (eg. veterans vs. service members vs. families/caregivers/dependents)?

## Other

> The logged-in homepage needs to scale to support all phases of the Veteran lifecycle ([Citation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/research-review-findings.md#what-are-other-known-insights-around-navigating-the-site-overall))

- Does the homepage need to exist in a logged-in state? Can My VA replace it?
