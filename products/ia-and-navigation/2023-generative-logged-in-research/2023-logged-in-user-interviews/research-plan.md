# Research plan for logged-in IA and navigation, Account Experience, March 2023

`DRAFT`

## Background
While we’ve observed some high-level problems people have navigating VA.gov’s logged-in experience (eg. people are reliant on homepage and My VA links), we’ve never conducted research that is solely dedicated to this topic. To remedy this, we’re conducting a variety of research activities, including user interviews, to help us clarify exactly what problems exist with the logged-in navigation, where we are not meeting users’ expectations, and what we might do to improve the overall experience. 

This insights we learn from people during these interviews will guide meaningful improvements to the logged-in IA and navigation in the coming year.

[Research brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/README.md).

### OCTO Objectives 
This research will directly support all of the OCTO north stars:
 1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
 2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
 3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

As well as the following 2023 objectives:
1. Enhance veterans’ personalized online experience
2. Refresh the VA.gov homepage and information architecture
3. Integrate the health portal features into VA.gov
4. Improve the veteran login experience

### Veteran Journey
The research covers a broad spectrum of VA services, and applies at any stage from Starting Up through Aging.

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 

*Pro tip: Limit 3 goals per study. If you have more than 3 goals, consider how to break up your research into iterative studies.* 

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Research questions
Consider bucketing research questions under research goals. For each question, think about:
- What will I do with what I learn from this question?
- Does this question serve the goals of my study?
- Do not write out all questions you plan to ask participants -- that should go in the [conversation guide.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md) 

### Hypothesis
- People will struggle finding what they’re looking for if they can’t use the homepage or My VA to find it

## Methodology	
This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom.

### Research materials
- [Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/2023-logged-in-user-interviews/conversation-guide.md) 
	
## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
The audience for our research will be a mix of Veterans, dependents, caregivers, and VSOs.

We’ll use Perigean to recruit participants.


### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**



**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.

- When do people login in a given flow (eg. right away, after finding a prompt in a content page, etc)?

**Outstanding question**: What sign in CTA(s) do people use (homepage, content page, main nav), and how easily they find these prompts?

**Outstanding question**: Does "sign in" or "create an account" make a difference? How important is it to differentiate between signing in and creating an account in calls to actions?

**Outstanding question**: Do people feel the site is only too generic when they are logged-in (assuming yes)? What level of personalization do they expect in the navigation?

**Outstanding question**: Is the problem with navigation the main nav, lengthy content pages (assume CTA is not on My VA or homepage), or both (or something else)?

**Outstanding question**: Does the homepage need to exist in a logged-in state? Can My VA replace it?

**Outstanding question**: Does this hold up when we add the layer of a visual navigation on top of a tree test? Is the delineation about "Get" and "Manage", or something else?

**Outstanding question**: What other wayfinding methods besides navigational terms should we consider?

**Outstanding question**: Is using the mobile app nav as a model for VA.gov a good idea? Given the inherent difference in these mediums, where is the line between how they should be similar and how they should and need to differ?


**Outstanding question**: How do needs and expectations around moving through VA.gov differ between user types (eg. veterans vs. service members vs. families/caregivers/dependents)?

What are peoples expectations from search when they’re already logged in?
