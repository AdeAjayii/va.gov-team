# Research plan for logged-in IA and navigation, Account Experience, March 2023

`DRAFT`

## Background
While we’ve observed some high-level problems people have navigating VA.gov’s logged-in experience (eg. people are reliant on homepage and My VA links), we’ve never conducted research that is solely dedicated to this topic. To remedy this, we’re conducting a variety of research activities, including user interviews, to help us clarify exactly what problems exist with the logged-in navigation, where we are not meeting users’ expectations, and what we might do to improve the overall experience. 

This insights we learn from people during these interviews will guide meaningful improvements to the logged-in IA and navigation in the coming year.

[Research brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/ia-and-navigation/2023-generative-logged-in-research/README.md).

### OCTO Objectives 
This research will directly support all of the OCTO north stars:
 1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
 2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
 3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

As well as the following 2023 objectives:
1. Enhance veterans’ personalized online experience
2. Refresh the VA.gov homepage and information architecture
3. Integrate the health portal features into VA.gov
4. Improve the veteran login experience

### Veteran Journey
The research covers a broad spectrum of VA services, and applies at any stage from Starting Up through Aging.

## Research Goals	
Our goal with this research is to identify problems and expectations with navigating the logged-in experience on VA.gov.


### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Research questions
* How do people find tasks they need to complete? 
* How do they do this without the homepage/My VA links?
* How can we make the site easier to navigate for logged-in users?
* What level of personalization do people expect in the navigation after they’ve logged in?
* How do navigation needs and expectations differ between user types?

### Hypothesis
- People will struggle finding what they’re looking for if they can’t use the homepage or My VA.
- People will expect a level of personalization similar to what we have today in the overall main navigation, but will expect more options in the name drop down menu.
- Navigation needs and expectations will be similar across user types.

## Methodology	
This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom.

We’ll use Perigean to recruit participants.
