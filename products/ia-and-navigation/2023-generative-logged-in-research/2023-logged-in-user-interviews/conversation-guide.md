## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, I’d like to go over some basic logistics for today.

Today we're going to talk about how you do things related to benefits and services you receive from VA online. You will need to log into your VA.gov  account, and share your screen, which means we might see some of your personal information. Are you comfortable with that?
**If participant declines, end the session.** That’s ok, I understand. Unfortunately, to complete the session today we would need you to do that. We can go ahead and end the session now; we really appreciate your time and willingness to be here today.

### For screenreader sessions:
- I understand that you use a screen reader, and according to my notes you use [software]. Will you be using that in the session today? 

Great, thank you. We have an accessibility specialist in the session, standing by to help if we have any technology issues.

### For all sessions:
- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve this website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with 3 additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - X minutes
Before we start looking at the website, I want to learn a more about you.  When the session was scheduled you provided some information. 

- I understand you are a [*Veteran / Caregiver / Family member )* Is that right? *If Caregiver, confirm:* Are you a caregiver for a Veteran? Are you a Veteran?

- And, according to my notes you have [services/benefits from Perigean participant tracker] through VA. Is that correct? 
- Thanks for confirming that. Are there any other benefits or services that you receive?
- Do you manage or access that benefit or service online at all? Tell me more about that.
	- *If needed:* what website do you use to do that?

- In order to join today’s session, you needed to confirm you have a VA.gov account - tell me about the last time you logged into the account. 
	* Why did you log on?
	* What did you end up doing while logged on?


### Things to note:
- What benefits/services does the veteran have?
- Do they already use VA.gov to manage or access that benefit?
- If they don’t use VA.gov but they use the internet in another way, what is that other way?
- What did they last do on VA.gov?

## Task 1: Complete benefit related task - 12 minutes / 24 min for screen reader sessions
**Task goal:** *See how they go about navigating to their task, ultimately on VA.gov. They may start with Google searching or something else, which is fine. Eventually, we’ll need to guide them to logging in on VA.gov if they don’t go there on their own. We’ll also want to evaluate how they’d get to this task if they couldn’t use the homepage or My VA*.

Thanks for sharing all of that with me. Now I’ll have you share your screen in zoom. Do you know how to do that? If not, I can help you.

*Guide with screen sharing if needed*

I can see your screen, great! We can get start looking at websites now.

**If participant clearly stated a benefit or service you can pull a task from:**
Now that you’re logged in, can you show me how you  (use their language for what they ended up doing while logged in)? It’ll help if you can think out loud as much as possible.

**If participant does not have any recent experience with VA to pull from, pull logged-in task from Cindy’s top task research findings:**
Imagine you wanted to get your VA medical records. Show me how you’d go about doing that. It’ll help if you can think out loud as much as possible.

**Stop participant before they click on the homepage, and send the link to the new version of the homepage via chat before they hit VA.gov** 
QUESTION FOR TEAM: Does the new homepage redirect to My VA if you sign in from there?

- *If needed,*
	- Tell them to open a browser
	- Can you show me how you’d do that on the VA website?
	- Guide away from MHV or eBenefits to VA.gov 
	- Share the new homepage or health hub page with them when they land on current versions (need links)
	
**! Stop the participant before they submit any applications or change their actual information !**

Thank you for showing that to me! 

**If participant used a link from homepage or My VA:** Can you show me how you’d do that if the link wasn’t on the [homepage or My VA]? Where would you go?

Thanks, that is helpful to see. Before we move on, I’m curious to get your thoughts on the website now that you’re signed in to your account.  How does it line up with what you’d expect?

### Things to watch for:
- If we were able to pull from participant experience, what task did they need to complete?
- Where does the participant start? VA.gov or somewhere else?
- What prompted the person to sign in? Did they do it right away, or from a content page?
- What did the person click on to sign in?
- What is the navigation path the person took once they got to VA.gov to complete their task?
- Does the layout of content pages that lead to tools affect the user experience of navigating to tools?
- Was the person able to complete their task?
- What, if anything did the participant find confusing?
- Where did the person go if they couldn’t use My VA or the Homepage?
- If they couldn’t navigate to their task, what did they do?
- How does the logged-in experience line up with what they expected?

## Task 2: Complete second benefit related task - 8 min / 16 min for screenreader sessions
Now I’d like to see how you go about finding a something else on the website.  *Ok for participant to start wherever they are on the website, or from a fresh browser if that’s what they’d do.*

**If participant clearly stated a benefit or service you can pull a task from:**
Thinking about your [benefit or service], are there other related things you need to do online, or that you had to do in the past? Show me how you’d go about doing that, and please continue thinking out loud. You’re doing a great job with that.

**If participant does not have any additional experience with VA to pull from, pull logged-in task from Cindy’s top task research findings:**
Now imagine you wanted to file for a disability increase. Show me how you’d go about doing that, and please continue thinking out loud. You’re doing a great job with that.

- *If needed,*
	- Guide away from MHV or eBenefits to VA.gov 
	- Share the new homepage or health hub page with them when they land on current versions (need links)
	
**! Stop the participant before they submit any applications or change their actual information !**

Thank you for showing that to me! 

**If participant used a link from homepage or My VA:** Can you show me how you’d do that if the link wasn’t on the [homepage or My VA]? Where would you go?

### Things to watch for:
- If we were able to pull from participant experience, what task did they need to complete?
- What is the navigation path the person took to complete their task?
- Does the layout of content pages that lead to tools affect the user experience of navigating to tools?

##Task: Update contact information - 5 min / 10 min for screen reader session
Now I’d like to for you to show me one last thing - how would you update the address you have on file with VA?
	
**! Stop the participant before they change their actual information !**

Thank you for showing that to me! 

**If participant used the link from My VA:** Can you show me how you’d do that if the link wasn’t on My VA? Where would you go?

### Things to watch for:
- What is the navigation path the person took to get to the profile?
- Was the person able to complete their task?
- What, if anything did the participant find confusing?
- Where did the person go if they couldn’t use My VA?
- If they couldn’t navigate to profile, what did they do?

## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
Those are all the things I wanted you to show me on the website. Thanks for going through that with me! I have just a few more questions.
- If you can’t find what you’re looking for on the VA website, what else do you try?
- What are other websites that you use a username and password to log on?
	- What do you expect to change when you log on to _____?
	- What on the site indicates that change to you?
- I’d like for you to take a moment and review the top portion of the website (header). Considering the fact that you’re logged into the website, how does what you see line up with your expectations?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
