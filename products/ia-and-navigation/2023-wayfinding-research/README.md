## Overview

With the addition of so many tools to VA.gov since the original redesign, we have seen issues with IA/navigation arise around how people find tools and tasks. Things are about to get extra complicated as the health apartment migrates into VA.gov. This research effort aims to understand the problems users' have with finding tasks and tools in VA.gov's current structure.

## Problems

- The current VA.gov experience largely caters to content, making it challenging for visitors that need to track and manage benefits and health care.
- Integrating MHV tools and experience are into VA.gov will result in an auth exp for health, but this does not consider applying for and managing other benefits.
- We need to accommodate multiple audiences in this experience, including audiences that may be acting as a delegate to another account holder, families, caregivers, providers, school administrators, etc.
- Web-based tools that allow visitors to complete tasks related to the benefits they have are organized by benefit, however some tools are applicable to multiple benefits or are not specific to any benefit.

## Goals

- Understand what research has already been done, and establish what we already know about wayfinding issues and challenges on VA.gov.
- Understand what issues veterans and other users have navigating the current VA.gov landscape.
- Understand stakeholder expectations around navigation and navigation updates.
- Work collaboratively across crews, so this work isn't silo'd.
- Consider flows through full logged out > logged in states instead of thinking of wayfinding as two distinct or competing experiences (unauth vs. auth).
