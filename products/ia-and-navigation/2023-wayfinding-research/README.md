## Overview

With the addition of so many tools to VA.gov since the original redesign, we have seen issues with IA/navigation arise around how people find tools and tasks. Things are about to get extra complicated as the health apartment migrates into VA.gov. This research effort aims to understand the problems users' have with finding tasks and tools in VA.gov's current structure.

## Problems

- The current VA.gov experience largely caters to content, making it challenging for visitors that need to track and manage benefits and health care.
- Integrating MHV tools and experience are into VA.gov will result in an auth exp for health, but this does not consider applying for and managing other benefits.
- We need to accommodate multiple audiences in this experience, including audiences that may be acting as a delegate to another account holder, families, caregivers, providers, school administrators, etc.
- Web-based tools that allow visitors to complete tasks related to the benefits they have are organized by benefit, however some tools are applicable to multiple benefits or are not specific to any benefit.

## Goals

### Research goals

- Understand what research has already been done, and establish what we already know about wayfinding issues and challenges on VA.gov.
- Understand what issues veterans and other users have navigating the current VA.gov landscape.
- Understand stakeholder expectations around navigation and navigation updates.
- Work collaboratively across crews, so this work isn't silo'd.
- Consider flows through full logged out > logged in states instead of thinking of wayfinding as two distinct or competing experiences (unauth vs. auth).

### Experience goals

We want to create:

- A personalized experience for Veterans and family members/caregivers that allows them to easily find the right information and tools they need to complete tasks related to whereever they are in their journey .
- An experience that surfaces what's important at the right time for visitors that have VA benefits and need to complete tasks related to managing their health and benefits at VA.
- An experience that provides the right amount of information for people to quickly learn about and apply for VA benefits.

## Project risks & challenges

### This work requires cross-crew collaboration and alignment

Wayfinding research will likely need to involve many crews, including account experience (My VA & profile teams; Mikki), Sitewide (Unauth home page, benefit hubs, R&S, header), and Health (My health).

Additionall, any future updates to navigation would require all crews to be onboard and to work together: 

- Auth - My VA, profile, notifications, chatbot
- Sitewide - Unauth home, benefit hubs, R&S, header
- Health - My health
- Benefits - IA and labeling
- Platform - design system
- Mobile app - IA and labeling

### People to work on this effort are limited

When this work starts, Mikki will be the only personw who's full-time on this work, and she doesn't have a team. We need a team of folks to support this work, just like we do with any effort. This will require product, IA, design, research, and content all working together.

### People still view IA/navigation as "unauth" and "auth"

Though differences in logged out and logged in experiences are common across the web, our teams tend to treat these as totally separate experiences, making updates in silo'd ways that creates for a disjointed experience across VA.gov. We may face challenges in this work changing the culture/mindset around how people think about navigating VA.gov.

### There's A LOT to think about when it comes to wayfinding

VA.gov needs to cater to health care and benefits and multiple audiences. This site needs to do **a lot**. Scoping this work and breaking it down into manageable chunks may be challenging as a result.

## Questions

- What work is happening across other teams that could effect the navigation (eg. notifications work, health apartment, etc)?
- What are the known problems for users around navigation (eg. reliance on homepage quick links)?
- How do OCTO stakeholders think about VA.gov site navigation? What are some stated and unstated assumptions they have?
- What requirements do outside stakeholders put on VA.gov re: the navigation?
- What are the immediate plans for integrating the health apartment into the navigation?

## Research activities

Potential activities include:

- Historical research review
- Comparative research with other sites (though we've done a lot of this in the past and may not need to repeat)
- Stakeholder interviews
- User research
