## Mission of IA at VA

To ensure Veterans and their family members can easily and quickly find the right information they need to successfully complete their tasks with the least amount of friction.

We will accomplish this by:
- Designing and maintaining an organizational structure that matches the mental model of our audience
- Defining a labeling system that is understandable and consistent across all channels
- Establishing a navigation system that intuitively helps users get to and through features of the site

*Information Architecture works in strong partnership with content, design, accessibility, engineering, and product in the design, development, and implementation of the above.*



## How IA helps 

Good IA can help improve a visitor's experience by
- **Organizing and grouping information** in ways that meet the mental model and various needs of our visitors – i.e. by benefit, by audience, or by their journey
- **Prioritizing information** to help visitors quickly understand what’s available and avoid overloading them with too much information 
- **Labeling features in a relevant, concise, and consistent way** so visitors understand what something is and can recognize and find it across channels
- **Surfacing information multiple ways** to help with findability and discoverability
- **Ensuring consistent and accurate navigation** elements to help with wayfinding and forward progression
- **Creating efficient and logical pathways** to and through information – accounting for the various ways a visitor can enter and exit your content and feature

In addition, well-organized content that utilizes clear and relevant labeling also helps
- Improve SEO 
- Meet accessibility needs 
- Reduce support calls 
- Build public trust and reputation
