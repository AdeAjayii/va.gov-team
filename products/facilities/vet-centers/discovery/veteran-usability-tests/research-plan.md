# Research Plan: Vet Center - Veteran Usability Test  

**December 2020 Discovery**<br>

## Goal

The goal of this study is to get high level Veteran feedback on webpage designs to understand if they would have enough information to make an informed choice in choosing Vet Centers for their care.

### Research questions

- How would clients go about searching for counseling and benefit services on a search engine? 

Will the designs provide Veterans with enough information to:
 - understand what care is available at Vet Centers?
 - perceive a difference between Vet Centers and other VA facilities?
 - understand the relationship between a main location and regional satellite offices? 
 - have enough information in order to visit or call a location? 
 - understand how indivual services will be rendered at this particular location vs another facility?

### Hypothesis 

- Clients will be able to find a service and feel they have enough information to choose care at this facility.
- Clients will feel that have adequate logistical information in order to visit or call a Vet Center.
- Clients will understand a Vet Center is not a traditional medical clinic.
