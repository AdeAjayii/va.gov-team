# Research Findings: Vet Center - non-client, Veteran - detail page usability study
**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Facility Locator**<br>

Leyda Hughes (leyda.hughes@adhocteam.us), 01/04/2021

## Research Goals 

The Facilities team tested a prototype of an upgraded Vet Center facility detail page with non-Vet Center client Veterans to understand if they would have enough information to choose care at a Vet Center.

We set out to gain high level input on Veteran’s understanding and usability of:

- Parent vs child location IA
- Service taxons
- Logistical information


Prior to the study, we hypothesized that:

- Veterans will understand the types of services offered/not offered. 
- Veterans will have enough information to visit a location. 
- Veterans will understand next steps for interacting with a Vet Center. 
- Veterans will understand that child locations may not have the same services as a parent location.


## Research Methodology 

Combined directed interviewing and usability testing, with task analysis, of a high-fidelity, desktop prototype created in UXPin.

### Who we talked to

We talked to 9 Veterans:

* All had engaged in some mental health care with the VA (most dealing with PTSD and/or MST)
* Ages 35-74
* 2 Vet Center clients
* 6 rural
* 5 female, 4 male
* 6 Caucasian, 2 African American 
* 1 wheelchair bound Veteran
* 4 with disability ratings of 70%
* Veterans of diverse levels of education and socio-economic situation


### Research Questions

Would Veterans:

- understand what type of care is available at Vet Centers? 
- understand that they cannot get primary medical care at a Vet Center? 
- be able to find the service that they are looking for within the list of taxons?
- gravitate more towards some taxons vs others? 
- understand the relationship between Vet Center parent and child locations? 
- understand that not all services are available at child locations? 
- have enough information in order to visit or call a location?



## Findings

### Findings by hypothesis
* Veterans will understand the types of services offered/not offered. 
  - **FALSE. Most participants confused Vet Centers with medical facilities.**



### Key Findings

1. Most Veterans thought they were looking at a medical facility's website.
2. Veterans who have been through counseling are comfortable with the term, "Mental health care".
3. Veterans expected to see more service information available within each service accordion.
4. COVID alert created usability issues for most participants.
5. A satellite's location influences the type of care assumed to be available there.
6. How a Veteran prepares for a visit varies widely depending on their context.
7. Placement and user experience of "More locations" was unexpected.
8. Positioning Vet Centers as being for those "transitioning", alienates some Veterans.
9. Women were more apt to look for all their care in Women Veteran Care.
10. A Veteran's mental state impacts their ability to cope with challenge.

### Details of Findings

#### 1.  Most Veterans thought they were looking at a medical facility's website.

Participants scrolled past the name of the facility and intro paragraph to complete their initial tasks, not noticing that this was not a VA medical facility.  4 never read intro, 4 read it towards the end of the session when they were asked to describe the facility.  

Participants carried the mental model of a VA hospital campus when describing additional information they expected to see within the service accordions, such as a number to call or if a referral would be necessary.

By the end of the session, many participants (those that did not never read the intro paragraph) still believed that they could go to this facility for primary care.

> “I would probably put it up at the top in that first little paragraph we do not offer any type of medical services.  I would definitely word it in a way that doesn't come off as being mean or threatening but just matter-of-factly so that the Veteran doesn't show up there,  thinking he's going to get his knee looked at. That's not what we do. But I think that'd be VERY frustrating for a veteran trying to go to these places. I would definitely put it at the top.  Mental health but not physical.”


#### 2. Veterans who have been through counseling are comfortable with the term, "Mental health care".

Where participants found individual counseling:

- 3 - Psychology (two later changed their preference to Mental health care, disparaging ‘Psychology’)
- 3 - Mental health care
- 2 - Women Veteran care
- 1 - Benefit counseling

Where participants found group counseling:

- 6 - Mental health care
- 1 - Military sexual trauma care
- 1- Women Veteran care

> “Psychology kinda seems, kinda cold – Veterans, we're very picky about labels. So when you pick psychology, well I'm not freakin crazy, I just need to vent or whatever. ”

> “I don’t think “psychology” should be its own dropdown. Most people are going to see that and then keep looking – they’re more likely to click “mental health care.” It could make sense to combine the two.”


#### 3. Veterans expected to see more service information available within each service accordion.

Participants expected to see:

- Name and phone number of person they needed to contact
- How an appointment would need to be made
- Where to go, what building, floor, etc
- Detailed information for each type of counseling or group breakout

> “Yeah, and I don't know if its because its a prototype but you wouldn't be able to click on it. Say if I wanted to look into Family Counseling, if I were able to hit ‘Family counseling’, but it doesn't tell you what to do next. Yes, we offer it but it doesn't tell me what to do next.”

#### 4. COVID alert created usability issues for most participants.

5 of 6 participants were exposed to the alert (removed after #6). 

- COVID Alert took up the entire screen for the majority of participants. This caused wayfinding issues. Participants thought they’d clicked on the wrong page or thought the page was about Covid. The details of the alert also added to the confusion about whether this was a medical facility due to the mention of flu shots in the description.

- One participant was angered and expressed that depending on her mental state that day it would have put her in a worse state.

> “I don't need to read through COVID to get to the place I need to be. This would irritate me more honestly. This would drive me nuts, cause COVID is affecting everybody right now not just physically but mentally. And this is one of the problems, to see this in your face again. It would just drive me nuts as I am already.”

> “Took me to the original page that I was on.” [user doesn’t realize they navigated to a new page]

#### 5. A satellite's location influences the type of care assumed to be available there.

Some Community Access Points are located in YMCA’s, churches, etc.  Veteran’s made assumptions that the type of care available may depend on where it is located. 

> “To me, the Atlanta Vet Center is just that, it's a Veteran Center, where the rest of these are, looks like within a facility so I wouldn't actually be dealing with the Veteran's facility, I'd be walking into like the YMCA center, like an office within the YMCA. The Vet Center at the Veteran of Foreign Wars, to me if I am not a Veteran of a foreign war, I wouldn't even be looking at this location. Because there are those of us that don't qualify for VFW. I served during peacetime. So I'm not clicking on that. Disabled Veterans, yeah, that works but is it just for disabled Veterans? Is it a facility that anyone can use.”


#### 6. How a Veteran prepares for a visit varies widely depending on their context.

Participants shared many questions regarding information they would need answered before visiting or even attempting to call a Vet Center.  For some dealing with mental health issues, it was crucial to know what to expect to lower anxiety. Before calling participants wanted to know:

- Details of a group therapy offerings, who would be running it, where would it take place, who could they call to inquire about it? 
- If Telehealth is offered, what are a Veteran’s privacy options? Can they remain off-camera? 
- What specific types of therapy that might be available, e.g. EMDR, CBT.
- Do I need to prepare forms (DD214), medication list, a referral from my doctor?
- Public transportation considerations, wheelchair assistance availability
- Is a live person going to answer if I call?  Is a first visit therapeutic or just an assessment?

> “[without a] direct contact number, you could wait forever, run you over your minutes if you’re left on hold. Most veterans nowadays don’t have a landline they have cell phone services. Not everyone has a contract most people just use prepaid services.”


#### 7. Placement and user experience of "More locations" was unexpected.

“More locations” was on a second page that linked from a small blur of text on the main page and was included in the “On this page” component. This was unexpected and created an “extra click” for users. Some participants never found additional locations on their own. Those that did expected to find more locations within the “Location and contact information” section and expected to see the listings after the first click.  

> “Well I clicked on it and then I gotta click on it again. Then it brings it up.”

> “the first thing that I would look at the 'Location and contact information'... I wouldn't look for it until after I was already looking at the [main location] address. I wouldn't have looked up [On this page] until you queued me to. I would have cruised down to location and zap right to the picture and contact information.”

#### 8. Positioning Vet Centers as being for those "transitioning", alienates some Veterans.

Some participants assumed that they would not be eligible to receive services at this facility after reading the words, “for Veterans, service members and their families needing help transitioning to civilian life”.

> “To me, this page seems to be specific to families who are transitioning to the VA, so I’m not sure if it is specific to me. I start to think that this isn’t what I’m looking for. I would probably keep scrolling some but just to check if the rest applies to me.”

> “It could be a lot clearer if it doesn't have to be for transitioning to civilian life. It could be family counseling period instead of 'putting transitioning to civilian life'. It could be a Veteran that's already out that needs the help. Yeah, I think that would throw some people off. If you've been out for a while you would think it doesn't pertain to you.”

#### 9. Women were more apt to look for all their care in Women Veteran Care.

Three female participants expanded “Women Veteran care” first when looking for individual or group counseling. They were all curious to know what would be offered that is specific to their needs.

> “I know not all VAs are up on Women Veteran Care, not that they're not up on it, but with Pittsburgh they usually that the latest things for women here if I didn't find it there then I would find something more specific like PTSD and see what they have there [opens PTSD] I guess individual counseling, it has. I like the Women's Veteran [goes back to it] A lot of the women now look for that when they go to VAs website, they look for specific to women.”

#### 10. A Veteran's mental state impacts their ability to cope with challenges.

Many participants shared how their specific mental state can impact their ability to handle certain situations. When in a difficult mental state participants mentioned, difficulty reading lots of text, “big words”, confusion,  getting lost on a hospital campus, or wading through a webpage page to find phone numbers, ignoring a COVID alert, as all being difficult mental tasks.

 > “Most people looking for help are just looking for simple. They aren’t looking for long, drawn out. If there gets to be too much information or too many big words that go on and on it’ll lose people, or they’ll just skip over it. When I was looking for help half the stuff I’d skip over it,  I’d be having anxiety headaches, really get confused and don’t want to be bothered by it. Simpler would be a lot more help.”
 
 > “This page looks fine if you're OK, have the time to look through this. But when you need help, you can get a more direct answer by putting in direct words into Google and it will come up directly "Veterans counseling number" or the "Veterans Crisis center" or whatever instead of having to read through all this.”
 
 
## Additional Findings

#### 1. Facility photo was important to all participants (information is inferred, assumptions made).
 
#### 2. Veterans thought the font on “On this page” was too small.

#### 3. “Satellite offices” was understood by 8 of 9 participants.

#### 4. Veteran's did not seem to notice or refer to the "Spotlight boxes" for any of the tasks.

#### 5. "Mobile Care Unit" was liked but set the wrong expectation.

#### 6. “Psychology” was selected and understood but disliked by Veterans.
#### 7. Diverse Veteran population representation was valued (homeless, minority, LGBTQ, etc).
#### 8. Veterans liked seeing group breakouts (no “lumping” of Vets) but also wanted more details.
#### 9. ‘Peer’ didn't resonate within Group counseling taxon name but may work better as a description.
#### 10. ‘Military sexual trauma care’ description needs more sensitivity (“safe”, less group emphasis).
#### 11. Veterans want to be given the right to choose their care (surface Vet Center option on VA websites).

## Primary recommendations

1. Increase information scent to allow Veterans to understand the page with only a scan.
- Shorten or replace intro copy, try tags or more scannable descriptors instead
- reconsider “readjustment counseling centers”
- Segment services into “Mental health counseling” and “social services” to give the page more context and make the facility’s purpose more scannable
- consolidate list of services to be more focused and scannable

2. Test “Mental health care” vs “Counseling” taxons on Veterans who have not gone engaged in either.
3. Make it more obvious that this is a small facility with one direct number to call.
4. Scale down COVID alert, progressively disclose details and reconsider placement.
5. Include more “Prepare for your visit” details in next prototype.
6. Try “Satellite locations” within “Location and contact information”, remove it from “On this page”.
7. Downplay that VC’s are for “transitioning" Veterans. 
8. Give more attention to “Women Veteran Care” service as the likely place a women will explore first.
9. Move call center alert to the top of page for Veterans to see first during off hours.

## Secondary recommendations

1. Keep “Satellite” as a way to describe community access points and outstations.
2. Consider increasing the fonts size of “On this page”.
3. Reconsider “Spotlight boxes” or enhance their design to be more interesting.
4. If used, “Mobile Care Unit” should be decoupled from list of services. Try treating it as a modality or as a separate location type with “Satellite office”. 
5. Remove “Psychology” as a Vet Center service. 
6. Keep diverse Veteran population representation but reconsider design to keep service list short.  
7. Consider “Group counseling” as a new taxon and give as much information about who, what, where and how to engage in this service within the accordion.
8. Lose ‘Peer’ in “Peer group counseling” but consider it in describing the concept of groups segmented by affinity that Veterans valued over group therapy that “lumps” all Veterans in the same group.
9. Work with copywriter on ‘Military sexual trauma care’ and all other service taxons/descriptions.
10. Consider cross-promoting Vet Centers from main VA medical facility pages mental health sections.


## Next Steps

* Share findings with stakeholders and discuss highest priority needs for MVP. 
* Work with copywriter for Vet Center website copy and service taxonomy.
* Refine Vet Center website prototype incorporating content and design recommendations.
* Test refined prototype with Vet Center client Veterans and service members.
