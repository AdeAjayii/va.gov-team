## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Leyda. I also have some colleagues on the line listening and taking notes.
Today we'll be discussing ideas for a new webpage that will live on the VA's website. We're looking for Veteran's input on how to make it better.

Before we get started, I want to give you an idea of what this call will be like:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes.
- We'll start with my asking you a couple warm up questions
- Then we'll do a bit of technical set up of Zoom. So that I can follow along with you today, I'll be having you share your Zoom screen and I'll help you through that.
- We'll look at a prototype of a website togther and we'll be discussing that for the remainder of the session. 
- Throughout the session, I'll be asking you about your thoughts and opinions about the information and content on the pages but there are no right or wrong answers. We're not testing you. We're actually testing the designs and the information contained on the pages to see how we can make them better for Veterans. So, I welcome your honest and candid feedback but if at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can simply move on to the next question. 
- This session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after the call is analyzed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 

 - If yes: 
 
**Once I start recording, I will ask again to confirm that you're ok with me recording this session so that it's captured in the recording.** 

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- **I have started recording.** So, I'd like to confirm:

Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

Ok, great. Thank you for that.


## Warm-up Questions 

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

Thanks for sharing that. 



## Counseling services 

For the purpose of this session, we'll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA. 
  
  - Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:
  - can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?
  - have you participated in any of these services?
  - how was that experience?
  
  
## Zoom sharing set-up

We're going to switch gears now and look at website together. I've found it can be helpful if we go through a warm up page first. As you're looking, I'd like for you to think out loud your observations and any the thoughts that come to mind.

## Page sharing warm-up with internet search 
 
I'm going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine that you've been going through a rough time. You're considering looking into mental health care or counseling options but you're not really sure what's available.

 - Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?
 - What words would you use to get you this type of information?
 - Can you try that search on the internet?
 
 Ok, thank you for that.
 

## Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services

Now let's imagine that as you're searching, you land on a website. 

I'm going to send you a link to that website. It's going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. Because it is a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

[Share link to prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/603da0b67ccefbbee74fcd8bb77a8fed12baabb5#/pages/134612636/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhidmhttp://)


Let's imagine that you're looking to talk to someone, a counselor, one-on-one. 

 - Is that type of care available here?
 
Feel free to click around. 

- If yes, how did this line up with your expectations 
- If no, 
   - Where you would expect to see that type of care?
   - Would it go by any other name?
- What could be improved about the way this service is listed or described?

####Things to watch for:
• Where does the participant first click?
• Does the participant expand the accordions?
 
## Task #2 - Find Group counseling services
 
Let's imagine that you're curious about group counseling.  

 - Is that type of care available here?
 
Feel free to click around. 

- If yes, how did this line up with your expectations 
- If no, 
   - Where you would expect to see that type of care?
   - Would it go by any other name?
- What could be improved about the way this service is listed or described?

#### Things to watch for:
• Where does the participant first click?

## Understanding alternative locations

Let's say you're curious to know if they have other locations.

- What can you tell me about Vet Centers locations? 
- In your own words how would you describe the relationship between the Atlanta location and the other locations?
- What type of services would be available at other locations?


#### Ready to visit

 Now that you've had a chance to learn about the Atlanta Vet Center let's imagine that you're interested in one of their services
 
 - What would your next step be?
 
 - What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?
 
 - Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?
 

#### General website questions

We're almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

 - In your own words, how would you describe the Atlanta Vet Center
 
 - How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?
 
 - Are there any types of services or care that you don't think you can get here?

 - What recommendations do you have for improving this website?

 
## Post-Task Interview

Those are all the questions that I had for you today. 

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?
