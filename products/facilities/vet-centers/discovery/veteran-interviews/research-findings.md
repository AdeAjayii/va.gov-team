## Research Goals 

As part of the larger discovery effort to understand the services offered by Vet Centers for the purpose of upgrading existing Vet Center facility detail pages, the goal of this study was to understand a Vet Center clientâ€™s experience, impression and relationship with Vet Centers.

Prior to the study, we hypothesized that:

- Current clients have a favorable view of Vet Centers and the services that they offer and view them as distinct entities from other VA facilities.

## Research Methodology 

45 minute generative questioning interview sessions conducted via Zoom.

All participants:
* 15 Veterans (8 of which were confirmed to be Vet Center clients)
* Ages: 1-(25-34), 1-(35-44), 2-(45-54), 2-(55-64), 6-(65-74), 1-(75+), 2-(Undisclosed)
