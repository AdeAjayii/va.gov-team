## Research Goals 

The goal of this study was to: 
As part of the larger discovery effort to understand the services offered by Vet Centers for the purpose of upgrading existing Vet Center facility detail pages, a series of stakeholder interviews was conducted with five Outreach Specialists. Outreach Specialists serve on the front line of Vet Centers connecting services to service members and were identified as a key persona in supporting the mission and purpose of Vet Centers.

## Research Methodology 

Hour long generative questioning sessions were conducted with five outreach specialists via Zoom.

### Who we talked to

Outreach Specialists:
* Bryan Doe - Springfield, MA
* Elizabeth Jackson - Orlando, FL
* Ken Milam - Escanaba, MI
* Austin Wilmarth - Colorado Springs, CO
* Troy Stormoen - Reno NV


### Research Questions

* How would an Outreach Specialist describe his or her role?
* How is eligibility determined?
* What kind of clients do different Vet Centers serve?
* Is the official list of services accurate?
* How do Outreach Specialists reach new and potential clients?
* How do Outreach Specialists promote their Vet Centers?
* What tools are used today to promote services and events?


## Findings


### Key Findings

1. Vet Centers have great autonomy in how they tailor and deliver services to their clients. 
2. Converting a service member into a client is a delicate art that can take multiple interactions. 
3. Eligibility determination should not be a barrier to a service member contacting a Vet Center.
4. Individual counseling, groups and referral services were rated as the top three most used services at their Vet Centers.
5. Referral to external services is as important as those provided by a Vet Center. 
6. Community Partners spread the word about Vet Centers. 
7. The potential geographical reach of a Vet Center is powerful but not easy to communicate today. 
8. Vet Center staff are often veterans themselves.
9. Vet Centers have limited resources to plan and promote outreach events. 
10. Managing communication with clients is tricky and very manual. 

### Details of Findings

#### 1.  Detail pages must feel distinct from VA Medical Centers and communicate Vet Centers’ “welcoming environment and hospitable culture”. 
A recent study conducted by Aptive Resources found this attribute to be especially important to clients, referencing their family-like atmosphere almost twice as often as any other attribute. Their data also suggested that it is the predominant differentiator between Vet Centers and VA medical centers. Maintaining this differentiation is important to reach Veterans who do not trust VA Medical Centers. Vet Centers are often cited as the first touchpoint in a Veteran or service member’s readjustment journey and can serve as the bridge to connect them to other VA services and benefits. Conversations with Outreach Specialists in this study support this recommendation. Ideas to strike the appropriate tone include: Use aspirational photography that highlights the more casual side of the counseling services available, for example, a group of Veterans fishing or at a BBQ. Prioritize an approachable welcome message over eligibility information. Add client testimonials.
