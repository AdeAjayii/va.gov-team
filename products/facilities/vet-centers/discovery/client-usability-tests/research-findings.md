# Research Findings: Vet Centers Product - Usability Study - V2
**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Facility Locator**<br>

Leyda Hughes (leyda.hughes@adhocteam.us), 02/10/2021

## Research Goals 

The Facilities team tested a mobile prototype of a revised Vet Center facility product page with Veteran clients and non-clients to understand if they would have enough information to choose care at a Vet Center.

The goal of this study is to gain high level Veteran input on the understanding and usability of the Vet Center mobile prototype and to test improvements from the first round of usability sessions conducted on a desktop prototype.

Areas of focus included:
- Service taxons 
- Services and care available/not available
- Information architecture and navigation
- Logistical information


Prior to the study, we hypothesized that:

- Veterans will understand the types of services offered/not offered. 
- Veterans will have enough information to visit a location. 
- Veterans will understand next steps for interacting with a Vet Center. 
- Veterans will understand that child locations may not have the same services as a parent location.


## Research Methodology 

Combined directed interviewing and usability testing, with task analysis, of a high-fidelity, mobile prototype created in UXPin.

### Who we talked to

We talked to 11 Veterans (of these, 4 were Vet Center clients):

- All had engaged in some mental health care with the VA and/or VC
- Ages 25-74
- 10 Veterans, 1 Army reservist
- 8 urban, 2 rural, 1 major metropolitan area
- 6 male, 5 female
- 5 Caucasian, 4 African American, 1 Hispanic/Latino, 1 undisclosed
- 4 with disability ratings of 70%, 1 amputee
- 5 Bachelor’s degree, 3 Master’s degree, 2 some college, 1 associates/trade/vocation
- 6 Android, 5 iOS devices


### Research Questions

Would Veterans:

- understand what type of care is available at Vet Centers? 
- understand that they cannot get primary medical care at a Vet Center? 
- be able to find the service that they are looking for within the list of taxons?
- gravitate more towards some taxons vs others? 
- understand the relationship between Vet Center parent and child locations? 
- understand that not all services are available at child locations? 
- have enough information in order to visit or call a location?


### Interview Session Setup

Participants were told to imagine a scenario where they were going through a rough time and were searching on the internet for counseling options. They were to imagine that their search lead them to the prototype. To simulate conventional user behavior, participants were given quick moment to review the page, but were purposely not instructed to describe it. 

Instead, they were first tasked with finding individual counseling. The task was followed by questions regarding their impressions and expectations of other services available at the Orlando Vet Center. 

Secondly, participants were asked about their understanding of other locations and next steps if they saw a service that they were interested in. 

Finally, participants were asked to describe the Orlando Vet Center in their own words and the types of care and services that would and would not be available at the Orlando Vet Center to gauge their understanding of Vet Centers as compared with other VA facility types.


## Findings

### Findings by hypothesis
#### Veterans will understand the types of services offered/not offered. 
  - **False. Most participants still confused Vet Centers with medical facilities.**

Even with content revisions aimed at clarifying a Vet Center's main purpose and service offerings, 6 participants still confused Vet Centers with medical facilities. Veterans understood that Mental health care and Veteran's benefits were the two main categories of services offered by this facility but by the end of the sessions, many Veterans still believed that they could use this facility for primary care. 
2 Veterans realized that this wasn't a medical facility only towards the end of the study when asked to describe the kind of care that they can and cannot get at this Vet Center. At that point, participants start looking for words, often in the page intro, to help them come up with a description. It is unclear if Veterans would naturally come to this conclusion on their own. 
5 Veterans understood that this facility with not a medical clinic, but 3 of those were Vet Center clients who had first hand experience with their service offerings.

* Veterans will have enough information to visit a location.
  - **Partially false. Veterans appreciated the additional information included in this iteration. However, participants still had questions that remained unanswered by the prototype before they would plan a visit to a Vet Center. **

**Reviews:** Looking for "reviews". 4 Veterans were very vocal about seeking out word-of-mouth or Google reviews before choosing a facility, stating that accounts of bad front desk customer service would keep them from choosing a facility. 
**Hours:** Calling for "real" hours and to understand when they'd actually be able to get in for an appointment. Would weekend or evening appointments actually be available. Vet Center clients took issue with "same day" and "walk-ins welcome" messaging reporting that it did not match their personal experience as compared with non-clients who were pleased to see "non-traditional hours" available. Vet Center clients felt strongly that expectations should be better tempered. 
**Intangibles:** Driving by, "case the place". Does it look “inviting”?


* Veterans will understand next steps for interacting with a Vet Center. 
  - **Mostly true. Most participants understood that they would need to call to make an appointment but many were dissatisfied with the options available for 
  - making contact. **

Phone contact was a deterrent for Veterans for many reasons: 

- Calling means being routed to a switchboard = stress, frustration, long wait times 
- Calling during work hours is impossible for some because; 
  - the perceived time commitment required to “Call the VA” is too great
  - no privacy at work to make a call about this subject matter
- Calling creates economic hardship for Veterans using prepaid phone service (previous study)

Veterans expected to see online scheduling, like MyHealtheVet, a contact form, or email, at the very least. Some described themselves as preferring "digital communication". For some Veterans, though, this option would meet greater emotional needs, **preventing the distress of having to talk to someone about the issues that they may not yet have the words to describe or would be too nervous to voice.**


* Veterans will understand that child locations may not have the same services as a parent location.
  - **Mostly true. Veterans understood that "Satellite locations" typically offer less services or limited hours as compared to a main location. **

Veterans broadly understood the term "Satellite locations" and that they typically offer less services or limited hours as compared to a main location. 7 understood that a satellite location would likely offer less services or limited hours as compared to the main location. 3 Veterans expected all locations to offer the same services with the exception of the Mobile Vet Center. Veterans understood that a Mobile Vet Center would offer less services. Veterans wanted to see hours listed for each location including the Mobile Vet Centers, likening them to a food trucks that "list their hours on Facebook".


### Key Findings

1. Most participants used the “Counseling services” jump link to find individual or group counseling.
2. Veterans sought out symptoms over clinical diagnoses when looking for services.
3. Veterans like “VA Connections” as a service but misunderstood the title.
4. Veterans like seeing affinity groups but quickly feel excluded if they can’t identify with one.
5. Most Veterans thought they were looking at a medical facility's website.
6. Veterans liked the services and eligibility that Vet Centers offers.
7. Vet Center clients believed the prototype set inflated expectations compared with their experiences.
8. Many Veterans did not distinguish between grief and bereavement.
9. Participants navigated between pages easily.
10. Participants felt the prototype was well organized but mentioned page length and scrolling.

## Additional Findings

#### 1. 3 Participants suggested improvements to intro text. One Veteran called the the first sentence the mission statement. Most had trouble with the second sentence which one Veteran felt should be a separate paragraph and bulleted, another suggested changing its focus to customer service. Some Veterans called out grammatical errors or awkward sentences when they encountered them.

#### 2. Veterans continue to equate “Referral services” with “getting a doctors referral”. This may be perpetuating the notion that this is a medical clinic.

#### 3. Veterans continue to mention how they are now more accustomed to doing Telehealth and now have an expectation of “Zoom appointments” and want to know when this is an option for them.
