## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Leyda. I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.
Today we'll be discussing ideas for a new webpage that will live on the VA's website.

Before we get started, I want to give you an idea of what this call will be like:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes.
- We'll start the session with a couple warm up questions.
- Then, we'll be reviewing a prototype of a website together. Since this is just a prototype, not everything will be clickable or fully functioning.
- Throughout the session, I'll be asking you about your thoughts and opinions about the information and content on the pages but there are no right or wrong answers. We're not testing you. We're actually testing the designs and the information contained on the pages to see how we can make them better for Veterans. So, I welcome your honest and candid feedback but if at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can simply move on to the next question. 
- In this session, I'll be having you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along and I'll help you through that. 
- First, I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you'll be using today?
    - Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.

_For iPhone:_

- OK great. When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share content, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share content." Any questions?
- Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
- Tap on Screen
- Tap Zoom
- Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
- Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share
- Great, now I can see your phone screen! I'm going to begin now if that's ok with you. We will return to this in a few moments.
_For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing_

_For Android:_
- OK great. When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe)

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "navigate" as I "drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?



**Recording Instructions**

[USER IS SHARING]

Great! Thanks for working through that with me. 

Finally, this session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after the call is analyzed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 

 - If yes: 
 
**Once I start recording, I will ask you once again so that the confirmation is captured in the recording.** 

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- **I have started recording.** So, I'd like to confirm:

Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions 

So, to get us started 

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

Thanks for sharing that. 

## Counseling services 

For the purpose of this session, we'll be mostly focused on different types of counseling and mental health services offered at the VA, like one-on-one counseling or in a group setting.
  
  - Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:
  - can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?
  - have you participated in any of these services?
  
Thank you for sharing that. 
  
## Internet search scenario
 
I'm going to give you a scenario to consider. 

I'd like you to imagine that you've been going through a rough time. You're considering talking to a professional. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven't done before so you're not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

 - Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?
 - Where would you search?
 - What words would you use to get you this type of information?
 
 Ok, thank you for considering that. I'd like you to keep this scenario in mind for the next part.
 
 ## Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services

I'm going to send you a link to a website to click on in the chat window inside Zoom. You may have to find that same row of buttons and find the one that says "chat" or it may be within a "more" button. As I mentioned before, it's going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. And because it is just a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would. 

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let's imagine that as you're searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you're need. Also, for purposes of this session, I'd like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.


[Mobile prototype to be tested](https://preview.uxpin.com/cdd25414c3c03534b7a8ee83b89f964219565580#/pages/135469174?mode=cvhidm)

OR type: rb.gy/tvmrpd 

_[Backup - Desktop prototype to be tested](https://preview.uxpin.com/cdd25414c3c03534b7a8ee83b89f964219565580#/pages/135469170?mode=cvhidm)_

OR type: rb.gy/k8slyu

I'll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan]

Continuing with our same scenario, imagine that you're looking to talk to a professional one-on-one. 

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here?
- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?

[narrate what the user did]

- Tell me what's going through your mind
- If yes, 
   - How did this line up with your expectations 
- If no,    
   - Would it go by any other name?
- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?
[have user expand an accordion if they haven't done so]

#### Things to watch for:
• Where does the participant first click?
• Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?
 

 ## Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations

For the next task I'd like for you to imagine that you say you're curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?
- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between the Orlando location and the other locations?

- What type of services would be available at other locations?

 ## Task #3 - Navigating back to main

Let's imagine that you're interested in one of the services at the main location. 

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

#### Things to watch for:
• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

**Ready to visit?**
 Imagining that you're interested in one of the services at the main location:
 - What would be your next step?
 - What else would you need to know before contacting this Vet Center?
 - Given what you know now, what might prevent you from contacting a Vet Center?
 

## General website questions

We're almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

 - In your own words, how would you describe the Orlando Vet Center
 - How would you describe the kind of care that can you get here?
 - Are there any types of services or care that you don't think you can get here?
 - What recommendations do you have for improving this website?
- Lastly, let's imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov's homepage.
How would you do that?

#### Things to watch for:
• How does the participant navigate? Breadcrumb? VA.gov logo?
 
## Post-Task Interview

Those are all the questions that I had for you today. 

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?


## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
