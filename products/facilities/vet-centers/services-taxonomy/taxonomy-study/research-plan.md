# Research Plan for Vet Centers, March 2021

## Goals	
The goal of this study is to understand how Veterans and their families understand and interpret the following services taxons in order to validate or invalidate them:

- Couples/Family counseling [new taxon]
- Education and training [new taxon]
- Returning Service member care [exisiting taxon]
- Veteran connections [new taxon]
- Whole health [exisiting taxon]

What about:
- Community outreach
- Grief and bereavement counseling
- Recreational and creative arts therapy

**Research questions**
- Do the current taxon (service names) make sense to Veterans and their families? 
- Does a Veteran's interpretation of the taxons match the descriptions used by VA? 
  - How would a Veteran define and/or describe the taxons in their own words? 

Maybe:
- How would Veterans organize/cateogorize taxons?
- How should taxons and their descriptions evolve for Veterans to immediately understand them?

**Hypothesis**
- Participants' interpretation of "Whole health" will match the intended meaning. 
- Participants' interpretation of "Returning Service memberh" will match the intended meaning. 
- Participants' interpretation of "Education and training" will match the intended meaning. 
- Participants' interpretation of "Couples/Family counseling" will match the intended meaning. 
- Participants' interpretation of "Veteran connections" will match the intended meaning. 

OR

- Interpretations of taxons will vary by cohort (e.g. gender, age/era, Veteran vs family of the Veteran)
- Veterans will group services together that are not currently listed in the same categories
- New groupings/categories will emerge that do not currently exist

## Method	
We will be sending an OptimalSort link to Veterans to participate in an unmoderated card sorting activity.	This method will help us answer our research questions by providing Veterans and their families the opportunity to complete the study in their own time without introducing moderator bias.

**Recruitment strategy** 

- We will utilize the Perigean contract for recruiting.
- We'd like to recruit 80 participants to reach our goal of receiving **40-50 participants** that meet the following criteria:

### Primary participant criteria:
- 7-10: Veterans 65+ [Vietnam era Veterans median age is 68 years]
- 7-10: Spouses of Veterans (who have used VA.gov to look up health or benefit information regarding their Veteran spouses' health)
- 7-10: 3 or less years since discharge/separation from military service
- 7-10: 3 or less years since joining the military and currently serving active duty
- 7-10: Reservists



### Secondary criteria / Would like to have - 
- 20 participant of color 
- 15 participants living in a rural or remote area 
- 15 females
- 1 participant 35 or under 
- 1 participant 36 - 45 
- 1 participant 46 - 55 
- 1 participant 56 or over 
- 1 participant with cognitive disabilities 
- 1 participant that do not have a college degree 
- 1 participant without a college degree (to include officer Vets) 
- 1 participant living in a major metropolitan area 
- 1 participant with a disability rating of 70% or greater  



## Timeline
The link for the card sort will be shared out during the week of March:___ . The card sorting exercise should take participants 10-20 minutes to complete.

The card sort link will be tested by a member of the Facility Locator team prior to sending it out.	

## Team Roles	
Since this is an unmoderated study, there will be no team members present for the sessions.
