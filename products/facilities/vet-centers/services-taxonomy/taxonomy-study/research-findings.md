**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Facility Locator**<br>

## Background

The Facilities team ran a taxonomy study to test new service taxons and validate existing ones that will be offered by Vet Centers. 

## Research Goals 

Primary goal: Understand how Veterans and their families understand and interpret new and existing service taxons that will be used by Vet Centers facilities, with a focus on the following: 

 - Education and training [new taxon] 
 - Transition counseling [new taxon] 
 - Veteran connections [new taxon] 
 - Whole health [existing taxon]

Secondary goals: 

 - Validate the existing categorization of services.
 - Follow up on a previous finding that Veterans want to see services labeled and described with symptoms rather than by clinical diagnosis.
 - Understand the language Veterans would use to label and describe services.

## Research Questions

- Do the proposed taxon (service names) make sense to Veterans and their families? 
- Do participants' interpretations of the taxons match their intended meaning? 
- How would participants define and/or describe the taxons in their own words? 
- What vocabulary do participants use when naming and categorizing the service taxons? 
- How would Veterans group and categorize the taxons? 
- How should taxons and their descriptions evolve for Veterans to immediately understand them? 
- Will participants, who have not participated in mental health care, use the term "Mental health care" when grouping counseling services?

## Hypotheses to be tested

1. Participants will interpret "Education and training" to mean services like workshops and classes in a non-therapeutic setting. 

2. Participants will interpret "Transition counseling” to mean a broad range of services that help Veterans transition to civilian life, like helping them connect with mental health services and education and career counseling. 

3. Participants will interpret "Whole health" to mean a personalized health plan that focuses on an individual's values, needs and goals rather than their illnesses or conditions. 

4. Participants will interpret "Veteran connections" to mean a service that includes helping Veterans navigate the VA, by helping them to connect to VA and community resources.

## Methodology

An unmoderated card sorting exercise was conducted; 17 services (cards) were asked to be sorted. This activity was accompanied by 7 fill-in-the-blank questions about some of the services. 

The study was divided into 6 mini studies, segmented by distinct demographic cohorts.
To mitigate biasing the responses, two tests were created with a re-ordering of questions. The two tests were distributed among the 6 studies. However, all questions were asked before the card sorting exercise.

# Findings by hypothesis

### 1. Participants will interpret “Education and training” to mean services like workshops and classes in a non-therapeutic setting.  

    Somewhat true

Participants were asked to define “Education and training”  [Q #4, 6]:

While no participant mentioned setting, nor used the term “non-therapeutic” in their in their descriptions, there was a high expectation of getting “assist(ance)”(7), with “benefits”(5), “resources”(5), “help”(4)  to understand “how-to” acquire training and education. (6) mentioned help with GI Bill benefits. (5) mentioned “Voc Rehab” programs more frequently than those related to actual classes and workshops; “career”(3), “certifications”(3), “courses”(3), “programs”(3), “skills”(3), “trade”(3). 

#### Recommendations

    “Education and training”  - OK to use

- Communicating “non-therapeutic” and the setting is not important.  This is a description of Vet Center facilities and not specifically of this service.

- Setting the right expectations about the type of classes, workshops, and certification(s) Veterans would be able to learn about is more important.

- Many participants mentioned assessment of skills to help them navigate career paths. If this is available, include it. Veterans don’t know what they don’t know and would like to know the best options for them. 

- “apprenticeships” and on-the-job training opportunities were mentioned multiple times.

- Veterans have an expectation of “assistance”, “help”, with “how-to” with everything from how to dress for an interview, how to write a resume to navigating GI Bill benefits.



### 2. Participants will interpret “Transition counseling” to mean a broad range of services that help Veterans transition to civilian life, like helping them connect with mental health services and education and career counseling.   

    Mostly true

Participants were asked to define “Transition counseling” [Q #4, 6]:

Most participants’ descriptions included concepts that echoed the current working description and understood that this service could span many areas of a person’s life. However, only (1) participant specified “Mental health care” type of counseling.  When other participants used the word “counseling”(10), they used it more broadly to encompass career, educational and benefit counseling.


#### Recommendations

    “Transition counseling”  - OK to use
    
- Participants’ ideas of what Transition counseling would offer closely matched the working definition and of what Vet Centers offers more generally.  Since responses were generally positive and hopeful descriptions, there is an opportunity for the phrase, or a variation of it, e.g. “Transition counseling center” to be emphasized and used to clarify the purpose and objective of Vet Centers. This could help reduce the expectation of medical care to be offered, which has been a consistent misconception uncovered in previous research studies. 


### 3. Participants will interpret “Whole health” to mean a personalized health plan that focuses on an individual's values, needs and goals rather than their illnesses or conditions. 

    Mostly true, but beware
    
Participants were asked to define “Whole health”  [Q #5]:

(29) participants understood the term to mean beyond but inclusive of physical health care. For Vet Centers this could mean reinforcing the misconception that a Veteran could obtain primary care in the realm weight loss or nutritional health care if this is not made more obvious. Participants used words like “holistic” and gave activity examples like many of those offered by Vet Centers. Participants did not describe the concept of “individualized care” or used the words “values”, “needs” and “goals” in their descriptions.

- (29) participants (69%) incorporated some form of social/emotional or mental health care descriptor.  20 used the word “mental”.
- (19) used words like “holistic”, “every”, “integrative”, “total” to explain care beyond traditional, physical medical care
- (14) responses included fitness concepts like “diet”, “exercise” and “nutrition”
- (4) included “spiritual”, 1 “soul”
- (2) mentioned social concepts “groups”, “recreation”, “volunteer”
- (2) included career or financial concepts, “financial health”, “job”

Words used most in user generated labels:

1. 8 - “activities”
2. 7 - “relax”, “relaxation”, or “relaxing”
3. 7 - “health” or “healthy”,
4. 6 - “stress”
5. 5 - “relief”
6. 4 - “therapy”
7. 3 - “self”
8. 3 - “care”
9. 3 - “coping”
10. 3 - “recreation”



#### Recommendations

    “Whole health”  - Use with caution
    
- Avoid or use with very with clear messaging that this does not include primary care. It would be advisable for this service name to be used only after the website can better differentiate itself from medical facilities. 

- However, since the term was well understood by participants, it could instead be used in a description to label classes and activity examples that crossover between clear cut categories. Another option is to create a new label from words that Veterans used and understood, “recreational activities”, or “relaxation programs”.



### 4. Participants will interpret “Veteran connections” to mean  a service that includes helping Veterans navigate the VA, by helping them to connect to VA and community resources. 

    False
    
In a preceding study participants were asked to define “Veteran connections” which participants struggled to do. To understand how participants might label the service themselves, they were presented with the current working description and asked to form a one to two word label for it.

Participant generated labels did not contain “connect” or “connection”, “community”.

Participants used words found in the description to come up with a label, fixating mostly on those relating to getting help with obtaining and navigating VA Benefits. 
Words most used in user generated labels:

1. 18 - “benefit” or “benefits”
2. 14 - “VA”
3. 6 - “navigation” or “navigating”
4. 5 - “assistance”
5. 5 - “help”
6. 3 - “information”
7. 2 - “support”
8. 2 - “access”

#### Recommendations

    “Veteran connections” - Rename
    
- Change label to “Navigating VA benefits”, “Veteran services help”, or something similar.

- Participants value this service but the label should focus on what Veterans will be connected to instead of conveying that the service is about “connecting”. What mattered most was learning about the benefits and services are available to them and how to get them. 

- Explain the “community” aspect in the description.

## Secondary Findings

### Testing “Mental health care”

This label tested well in previous studies with Veterans who’d been screened for having participated in Mental health care. In this study, we wanted to know if “Mental health care” would resonate with a broader audience.

VERDICT: HIGH CONFIDENCE

Words most used in user generated labels:

1. (21) included “mental”
2. (19) included “health”
3. (16) used “mental health”
4. (6) included “emotions”, “emotional”
5. (4) included “support”
6. (3) included “therapy”

#### Recommendations

    Mental health care” - OK to use
    
- Repeat high priority symptoms from PTSD (see PTSD recommendation)

### Testing “PTSD care”

In a previous study, Veterans told us that they want to see services labeled and described with symptoms rather than by clinical diagnosis, this came up most often in the context of PTSD. Participants explained that, early in their mental health care journey, they wouldn’t have yet had the vocabulary to connect their lived experience with the words presented in the current VA service; they would not have assumed they had PTSD.

In this study, we wanted to know from a broader audience, what words and symptoms were most associated with PTSD.

Participants were asked what words or symptoms they associate most with PTSD” [Q #7]:

Responses were analyzed by word frequency and by theme. Anxiety was the #1 symptom. “inability to control or cope” and “sleep” were top themes.

#### Recommendations

    “PTSD care”  - OK to use

- Use symptoms in plain language. Work with a clinician to incorporate more symptoms but translate them into plain language, and in verb form, whenever possible.

- Add common PTSD symptoms to “Mental health care”.

- Incorporate and emphasize anxiety-mitigating words and concepts from [previous research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/vet-centers/discovery/veteran-interviews/research-findings.md): “small”, “safe”, “intimate”, “confidential”, etc. to combat: “big”, “intimidating”, “bureaucratic” in describing how it’s delivered at a Vet Center.
