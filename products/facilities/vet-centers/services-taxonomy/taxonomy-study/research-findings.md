## Background

The Facilities team ran a taxonomy study to test new service taxons and validate existing ones that will be offered by Vet Centers. 

## Research Goals 

Primary goal: Understand how Veterans and their families understand and interpret new and existing service taxons that will be used by Vet Centers facilities, with a focus on the following: 

 - Education and training [new taxon] 
 - Transition counseling [new taxon] 
 - Veteran connections [new taxon] 
 - Whole health [existing taxon]

Secondary goals: 

 - Validate the existing categorization of services.
 - Follow up on a previous finding that Veterans want to see services labeled and described with symptoms rather than by clinical diagnosis.
 - Understand the language Veterans would use to label and describe services.

## Research Questions

- Do the proposed taxon (service names) make sense to Veterans and their families? 
- Do participants' interpretations of the taxons match their intended meaning? 
- How would participants define and/or describe the taxons in their own words? 
- What vocabulary do participants use when naming and categorizing the service taxons? 
- How would Veterans group and categorize the taxons? 
- How should taxons and their descriptions evolve for Veterans to immediately understand them? 
- Will participants, who have not participated in mental health care, use the term "Mental health care" when grouping counseling services?

## Hypotheses to be tested

1. Participants will interpret "Education and training" to mean services like workshops and classes in a non-therapeutic setting. 

2. Participants will interpret "Transition counseling‚Äù to mean a broad range of services that help Veterans transition to civilian life, like helping them connect with mental health services and education and career counseling. 

3. Participants will interpret "Whole health" to mean a personalized health plan that focuses on an individual's values, needs and goals rather than their illnesses or conditions. 

4. Participants will interpret "Veteran connections" to mean a service that includes helping Veterans navigate the VA, by helping them to connect to VA and community resources.

## Methodology

An unmoderated card sorting exercise was conducted; 17 services (cards) were asked to be sorted. This activity was accompanied by 7 fill-in-the-blank questions about some of the services. 

The study was divided into 6 mini studies, segmented by distinct demographic cohorts.
To mitigate biasing the responses, two tests were created with a re-ordering of questions. The two tests were distributed among the 6 studies. However, all questions were asked before the card sorting exercise.
