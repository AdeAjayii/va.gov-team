## Intro 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Laurel, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding the nearest VA facility near you.

Before we get started, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes

- We’ll start the session with a couple warm up questions

- Then we’ll be reviewing a prototype on a mobile device together. Since this is just a prototype, not everything will be clickable or functioning

- In this session, we want to hear your honest thoughts and opinions. We are not testing your ability. We want to improve the mobile version of the facility locator to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Please try and think aloud as you are clicking through and interacting with the prototype.

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

- I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you'll be using today?

- Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.

- I am going to send you a link to the prototype via the chat within Zoom, and we will go through a series of tasks related to finding a VA location near you.

_For iPhone:_

- OK great.  When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll want to tap on the phone screen, this will activate a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share screen, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share screen." Any questions?
- Tap ‘Share screen’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
- It will give you some options, choose "Screen"
- You should get a page that says "screen broadcast"
- Zoom should be checked, if not, please select it and tap "Start broadcast"
- It should start counting down as it starts to share (Zoom uses the phone's recording software to share)
- If you need to stop sharing during this session you can click 'Stop Broadcast'
- Great, now I can see your phone screen! 
_For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing_

_For Android:_

- OK great. When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll want to tap on the phone screen, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe)

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "navigate" as I "drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**User clicks on prototype**

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

 - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions

- Can you tell me a little about your service history or tell me about yourself?

- How often do you visit the VA website?

- Have you ever used the facility locator on desktop or a mobile device?

- Have you visited a VA Facility for healthcare in the past couple of years, or perhaps before the pandemic?

## First Task: Find the nearest urgent care center near you

## Scenario

**Things to watch for**

- How do they interact with the map?
- Does the user zoom/pan on the map?
- Does the user know on the map view that more than one location can be viewed (swipe right)?
- Do they compare locations?

## Fourth Task: Contact/visit a VA facility location

- About how many miles out would you want to see in the search results?
- How much area of the map would you want to interact with?
- Do you use any sort of map applications? If so, which one(s)?
