## Intro 

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Laurel, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding the nearest VA facility near you.

Before we get started, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes

- We’ll start the session with a couple warm up questions

- Then we’ll be reviewing a prototype on a mobile device together. Since this is just a prototype, not everything will be clickable or functioning

- In this session, we want to hear your honest thoughts and opinions. We are not testing your ability. We want to improve the mobile version of the facility locator to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. Please try and think aloud as you are clicking through and interacting with the prototype.

- I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you'll be using today?

- Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.

- I am going to send you a link to the prototype via the chat within Zoom, and we will go through a series of tasks related to finding a VA location near you.

_For iPhone:_

- When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll want to tap on the phone screen, this will activate a few buttons at the bottom. Audio, Video, Share screen, Participants, and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share screen." Any questions?
- Tap ‘Share screen’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen)
- It will give you some options, choose "Screen"
- You should get a page that says "screen broadcast"
- Zoom should be checked, if not, please select it and tap "Start broadcast"
- It should start counting down as it starts to share (Zoom uses the phone's recording software to share)
- If you need to stop sharing during this session you can click 'Stop Broadcast'
- Great, now I can see your phone screen!

_For Android:_

- When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll want to tap on the phone screen, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe)

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "navigate" as I "drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?

**User clicks on prototype and should be screensharing**

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

 - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.


## Start recording to the Cloud

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions

- Can you tell me a little about yourself or your service history?
- Have you used the VA website before?
- If yes, what were you looking for?
- Have you ever tried to find a VA facility on the VA website on your computer or a mobile device?
- Have you visited a VA facility for healthcare in the past couple of years?
- Do you use any sort of map applications? If so, which one(s)?

 
## Prototype - 35 minutes

## First Task: Find the nearest VA facility in the Washington DC area that offers optometry near you

### Scenario
- You've come to the VA website because you need to find the nearest facility that offers optometry services near you. You are currently living in the Washington DC area. Can you walk me through how you would do this? Let me know when you’re done and which one you selected.

**Things to watch for**

- How does the participant search by location (geolocation or address)?
- Is the user comfortable with letting VA.gov use their current location?
- Which dropdown option do they select?

## Second Task: Clear the location field, enter in a new location


### Scenario
You’ve decided you want to look for a facility that offers optometry in California where your mom lives, how would you do that?

**Things to watch for**

- Can the user easily clear the location field?

## Third Task: Review VA location search results list view

### Scenario

View the VA facilities near you and tell me which location you would choose to visit. 

**Things to watch for**

- What do you expect to see on the VA location card?
- Is any information about the location missing?
- Can the user easily scroll through results on the list view?

## Fourth Task: Review VA location search results map

### Scenario

[If they find the map tab] Before you click on anything on the map, what do you expect to see next? OK go ahead and tap on it.

[If they don’t naturally go to the map view,]  Ok did you see this tab that says map? If so, why didn’t you tap on it? 

Would a map be useful to you? OK go ahead and tap on it.
Compare the list view vs map, do you expect the information to be different?
Would a map be useful to you? 

## Fifth Task: Viewing more than one location on the map

### Scenario

While you are in the map tab, can you show me how you would view more than one location near you?

Tell me which location you would choose to visit and why


**Things to watch for**

- Does the user know that more than one location can be viewed (swipe right)?
- How do they interact with the map?
- Does the user zoom/pan?
- Does the user find that the map pins are interactive and find that they can be clicked to display a VA location card?
- How would the user expect to dismiss the location cards?

## Fifth Task: Contact a VA Facility

### Scenario
You’ve chosen a VA location near you, what would you do next to make an appointment?

**Things to watch for**

- Get directions, dial phone numbers for each location on mobile - do you like this?
- Is this tool useful for you on a mobile device, in what scenarios would you use this? Driving in a car?

## Post-Task Interview 

- What are your impressions of the list view versus the map view? Would you use one more than the other? Which might you use each view for?
- About how many miles out would you want to see in the search results?
- How much area of the map would you want to interact with?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing

I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
Thank you so much, and enjoy the rest of your day!
