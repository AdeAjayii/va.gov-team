View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/facility-locator/mobile-experience/research-plan.md).
## Research Goals 
- Understand how Veterans expectations for Find a VA Location search results differ for mobile vs desktop users
- Understand how industry standards impact Veteran expectations for the Facility Locator search experience
- Evaluate new designs created for geolocation, map view, and clear fields
- Validate if veterans are interested in using the map view of the Facility Locator (validate findings in the mobile month study)

## Research Methodology 
We conducted a remote, moderated, task-oriented usability study, using Zoom
- Participants logged into Zoom with their mobile device, shared their screen and opened up the prototype for us to observe their interaction.
- The participants had to imagine a couple of scenarios and were given tasks to perform within the prototype on their mobile phones.

The structure of the study:
- 2 minutes for introduction and helping participant to share their mobile screen on Zoom
- 2 minutes for warm-up questions 
- Approximately 20-30 minutes with usability tasks and questions
- 2-4 min for exit questions and wrap-up

### Who we talked to

The participants in this study consistend of 10 veterans:
- 5 male and 5 female
- 4 from rural area, 6 from a major metropolitan area
- Between 35 and 83 years old (8 of 10 was 55 years or older)
- A mix of educational level 
- 5 used Android and 5 used an Apple iPhone

### Research Questions

*Search box*
- Do participants understand how to enable their location?
- Do participants understand how to clear inputs?

*Search results*
- What are Veteran expectations of Facility Locator mobile experience?
- Will Veterans notice/understand the Geolocation functionality?
- Do Veterans using a mobile device prefer to view results on the map or in a list?
- Do Veterans expect to find detailed information on the map view?
- Do veterans know how to bring up the detailed information for each location?
- Does the information presented for a given facility match expectations?
- Does the Veteran understand how to find more detailed information about the facilities returned?
- What online maps/searches do these participants find easiest to use/why?

## Key Findings

1. Participants **had a variety of past experiences with the VA facility locator**, from “...it was a nightmare” to “...it was pretty easy”.
2. Most participants **did not utilize the “Use My Location” link.** A few did not notice it but said they might use it if they noticed it, a few do not want to use location services at all, and a few participants noticed it and thought it could be useful, but found it irrelevant to the task/scenario given to them.
3. Most participants **did not use the “x” icon to clear their address** and retype a new address.
4. **Choosing Facility type and Service Type was easy for most participants** when given the task to look for optometry. 
5. **Most participants found both the list and map view to be useful** depending on their circumstance.    
6. **About half the participants did not notice the map view on their own** without prompting.  
7. **Most participants understood that they could tap on a pin to view details in the map**, however after that, **they didn’t seem to understand overall how to dismiss and view other locations.** Overall there was awkwardness in the way participants interacted with the new map view designs and switched between map and list views. 


## Details of Findings
### 1. Participants had a variety of past experiences with the VA facility locator, from “...it was a nightmare” to “...it was pretty easy”
### 2. Most participants did not utilize the “Use My Location” link.
There were a variety of reasons folks were not using the "Use my location" link.  
- 3 of 10 were hesitant to using the location feature on their phones in general 
- 3 of 10 participants said they saw the Use my location feature and might use it, but they did not think to use it, because of the wording of the task.
- A few others did not see the feature at all
