## Research Goals 
- Understand how Veterans expectations for Find a VA Location search results differ for mobile vs desktop users
- Understand how industry standards impact Veteran expectations for the Facility Locator search experience
- Evaluate new designs created for geolocation, map view, and clear fields
- Validate if veterans are interested in using the map view of the Facility Locator (validate findings in the mobile month study)

## Research Methodology 
We conducted a remote, moderated, task-oriented usability study, using Zoom
- Participants logged into Zoom with their mobile device, shared their screen and opened up the prototype for us to observe their interaction.
- The participants had to imagine a couple of scenarios and were given tasks to perform within the prototype on their mobile phones.

The structure of the study:
- 2 minutes for introduction and helping participant to share their mobile screen on Zoom
- 2 minutes for warm-up questions 
- Approximately 20-30 minutes with usability tasks and questions
- 2-4 min for exit questions and wrap-up
