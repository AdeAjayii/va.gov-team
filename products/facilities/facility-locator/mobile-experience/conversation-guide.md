## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Laurel, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding vaccination information on the VA.gov website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to make sure that vaccination information is easy to find on VA.gov. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Now I'll give you a quick overview of today's session.
- First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started.

- After that I will send you a link to a mobile web page. On that page, I will...

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

    - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

- Can you tell me a little about your service history?

- Have you visited a VA Facility for healthcare in the past couple of years, or perhaps before the pandemic?
 

## Prototype - 35 minutes
<em>Zoom sharing set-up</em>

<em>zoom help - make participant the presenter and ask them to share their screen.</em>

At this point we're going to switch gears now and look at a website together. Before you share your screen, let's start by having you open a browser window, whatever you normally use to do searches on the internet. Let me know when you have one open.

Now I'd like you to go back to Zoom and find a "Share screen button" It's usually at the bottom of the screen within a row of buttons and sometimes disappears until you mouse over the bottom area of Zoom. 

Once you click the button, Zoom should ask you which window you'd like to share, it should give you small preview images of the open windows. Look for the browser window that I just had you open and click on it. You may have to click another button to start sharing.

I am going to send you a link, and we will go through the tasks I mentioned.
I will send it to you via the chat function within Zoom. The chat button is also usually within the bottom row of buttons as a button on its own, shown as chat or under a more button.
