# Research Plan: Facility Locator - Mobile Experience

## Goals
- Understand how Veterans expectations for Find a VA Location search results differ for mobile vs desktop users
- Understand how industry standards impact Veteran expectations for the Facility Locator search experience

## Background 

- In a mobile month study, veterans were not interested in using the map view of Facility Locator #14484
- In the mobile month study, veterans were not able to find the Facility Locator from the VA.gov homepage
- The Facility Locator search experience has not been approached from a mobile-first perspective
- Updates to the user interface to be tested include the implementation of two new features ("use my location" and "clear field") and the resolution of accessibility defects

## Hypotheses

- Veterans need to be able to enter data and clear field inputs easily
- Veterans searching for a VA location on a mobile device will want to view closest VA facilities in a list and on a map
- Veterans using the map view will know that by tapping on map pins, they will see facility information and location
- Veterans want to be able to opt-in to geolocation at search level, rather than via browser
- Veteran expectations of the Facility Locator need to be alined with other private industry map-based mobile search experiences

## Questions

**When searching on mobile device**

**Search box**
- Do participants understand how to enable their location?
- Do participants understand how to clear inputs?

**Search results** (Adjusting to be more precise with questions about design)
- What are Veteran expectations of Facility Locator mobile experience?
- Will Veterans notice/understand the Geolocatoin functionality?
- Do Veterans using a mobile device prefer to view results on the map or in a list?
- Do Veterans expect to find detailed information on the map view?
- Does the information presented for a given facility match expectations?
  -  Does the Veteran understand how to find more detailed information about the facilities returned?
- What online maps/searches do these participants find easiest to use/why?

Form top tasks around these questions
Can Veterans find the Facility Locator? Start them on the homepage and give them task to find facility locator (need optometrist, find one). This may not be needed since Mobile Month study already proved that users were struggling with finding this.

**Method**
- Sessions will consist of mobile device usability testing, with task analysis, of a high-fidelity, mobile prototype created in UXPin.
- Sessions will be remotely moderated via Zoom. 

## Risks and assumptions

This study:
- will not test screen reader, keyboard or other Assistive Technology use; findings may not reveal problems that users with these technological constraints may encounter.
- will use a prototype with a map that will differ in how a fully programmed website will behave when a user uses certain gestures to adjust the map. 

## Participants and Recruitment

- We will utilize the Perigean contract for **recruiting and notetaking**.
- We'd like to schedule 15 participants to reach our goal of observing **10 participants**.
