# Research Plan: Facility Locator - Mobile Experience

## Goals
- Understand how Veterans expectations for search results differ for mobile vs desktop users
- Understand how industry standards impact Veteran expectations for the Facility Locator search experience

## Background 

- In a mobile month study, veterans were not interested in using the map view of facility locator #14484
- The Facility Locator search experience has not been approached from a mobile-first perspective
- Planned changes include the implementation of two new usability features ("use my location" and "clear field") and the resolution of accessibility defects

## Hypotheses

- The FL search experience could be better for mobile users. It is not aligned with Veteran expectations or other private industry map-based mobile search experiences.
- Veterans want to see and use a list view for information on facilities.
- Veterans searching on Facility Locator on a mobile device will also want to view useful facility information displayed independently from the list view (map view):
  - Veterans using the map view will know that by tapping on map pins, they will see useful facility information.
- Veterans need to be able to clear field inputs
- Veterans want to be able to opt-in to geolocation at search level, rather than via browser.

## Questions

**When searching on mobile device**

**Search box**
- Do participants understand how to enable their location?
- Do participants understand how to clear inputs?

**Search results**
- Do Veterans using a mobile device prefer to view results on the map or in a list?
- How many results do Veterans expect?
- How do Veterans expect facility details to be presented?
- Does the information presented for a given facility match expectations?
  -  Does the Veteran understand how to find more detailed information about the facilities returned?
- What online maps/searches do these participants find easiest to use/why?

**Method**
- Sessions will consist of usability testing, with task analysis, of a high-fidelity, mobile prototype created in UXPin.
- Sessions will be remotely moderated via Zoom. 

## Risks and assumptions

This study:
- will not test screen reader, keyboard or other Assistive Technology use; findings may not reveal problems that users with these technological constraints may encounter.
- will use a prototype with a map that will differ in how a fully programmed website will behave when a user uses certain gestures to adjust the map. 

## Participants and Recruitment

- We will utilize the Perigean contract for **recruiting and notetaking**.
- We'd like to schedule 15 participants to reach our goal of observing **10 participants**.
