# README - Research: Facility Locator - Mobile Experience 

## Background 

- In a mobile month study, veterans were not interested in using the map view of facility locator #14484
- The Facility Locator search experience has not been approached from a mobile-first perspective
- Planned changes include the implementation of two new usability features ("use my location" and "clear field") and the resolution of accessibility defects
