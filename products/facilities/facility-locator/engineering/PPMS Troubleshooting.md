### PPMS is making a change to their API
#### How to update the VCR tapes
  SSH into a staging box, make note of the internal IP Address. As a non root user run the `vcr.rb` script with the `-R` record flag. It will create the vcr tapes and copy them into the `/tmp` directory of the staging box.

  After the script has finished running run the same script with the `-D` download flag, it takes the IP Address as an argument. The script will then download the the vcr tapes into the current directory with the following naming convention: `#{datestamp}-#{offset}-ppms.yml` I found that keeping the tapes so you can compare the results was helpfull when trying to track down a change.

  Once you have the vcr tape downloaded to you machine copy it into the `vets-api` repo and replace the current script. You can then run the `rspec` test suite and fix any issues due to the data changes.

### General Troubleshooting
  These are the tools that I have used to diagnose problems
   - Access to the VA network (GFE or Citrix)
     - You can only access PPMS API docs from the VA Network
   - Access to AWS
     - We store the API keys in the ParamStore
     - PPMS APIs can be accessed from the vets-api vms hosted by amazon
   - Monitoring tools
     - [Graphana](http://grafana.vfs.va.gov/d/000000048/facility-locator-ppms?orgId=1)
     - [Sentry](http://sentry.vfs.va.gov/organizations/vsp/issues/?query=is%3Aunresolved+FacilitiesApi&statsPeriod=14d)
   - Helpfull Scripts I've included
     - `vcr.rb` a single file bundler enabled app to generate vcr tapes outside `vets-api`
     - `request-to-curl` this is what I use to generate the `curl` command from any given url
   - Usefull things to know about `vets-api`
     - `FacilitiesApi::V1::PPMS::Configuration` includes some commented out Middleware
       - `curl` will log the request its attempting to make to `STDOUT`
       - `logger` logs the body of the response to `STDOUT`


### Requests to PPMS are Failing
  PPMS Requests are failing, You might notice then when monitoring Grafana, Sentry, or Datadog. These can be difficult to troubleshoot. You need to recreate the request and run it from a staging box. Remember to get the API keys from `ParamStore`. You can use the `vcr.rb` script to make some requests to PPMS and the bodies should help point you to the problem.

#### PPMS is returning a stack trace
  PPMS is having a major issue and `ppmsit@va.gov` needs to be notified ASAP.
  Make sure that the breaker isn't causing an issue (this is the reason we ratelimit requests from a given IP address)

#### PPMS is returning an empty body
  There are three things that may be having an issue.
  - PPMS
    - Does it work from the commandline (`curl`)?
    - Does it work from PPMSs SWAGGER page on the VA network?
      - you can't copy and paste into `citrix`
  - The Reverse Proxy
    - Check the request metrics in Grafana, do they seem normal?
    - Have there been any changes to the `ha-proxy` configs?

#### PPMS requests are timing out
  We have a really high timeout for a reason. But sometimes PPMS requests have taken over 2 minutes to return a response. When PPMS requests are timming out I recomend checking the Grafana Facilities dashboard. Is there a spike in response time? Do you have the same slow response if you make the request directly to PPMS without going through the reverse proxy? If you contact PPMS and they insist that the responses are fast on their end you may have an issue with the TIC. This has happened several times in the last two years and we haven't been able to get a consitant failure case to trouble shoot the problem.
