## VBA Services Discovery

Discovery for [issue #30836](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30836).

### Goals

To prepare for taxonomy work on Benefit services, we need to match patient friendly language which has already been discovered for Resources and support with the the service descriptions used by VBA. Language used in the Facility Locator service dropdown for benefit facilities may also be helpful.

- For each of the services listed above, discover Veteran-facing language in the Resources and Support hub which aligns. It may not be a 1:1 relationship
- Discover any additional services which appear to be offered at Benefit locations which could be mapped to "other services"

[Resources and support](https://www.va.gov/resources/)

### Background Research



### Method

Audit of [Resources and support](https://www.va.gov/resources/) hub to find relevant Veteran-facing language for each service, if present.
