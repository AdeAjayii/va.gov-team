## VBA Services Discovery - Resources and support

Discovery for [issue #30836](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30836).

### Goals

To prepare for taxonomy work on Benefit services, we need to match patient friendly language which has already been discovered for Resources and support with the the service descriptions used by VBA. Language used in the Facility Locator service dropdown for benefit facilities may also be helpful.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Benefit facilities - services data call:</strong></summary>
  
- Applying_for_Benefits
- Burial_Claim_assistance
- Disability_Claim_assistance
- eBenefits_Registration
- Education_and_Career_Counseling
- Education_Claim_Assistance
- Family_Member_Claim_Assistance
- Homeless_Assistance
- VA_Home_Loan_Assistance
- Insurance_Claim_Assistance
- IDES
- Pre_Discharge_Claim_Assistance
- Transition_Assistance
- Updating_Direct_Deposit_Informa
- Vocational_Rehabilitation_Emplo
- Other_Services
  
</details>

- For each of the services listed, discover Veteran-facing language in the [Resources and Support](https://www.va.gov/resources/) hub which aligns. It may not be a 1:1 relationship
- Discover any additional services which appear to be offered at Benefit locations which could be mapped to "other services"

### Background Research

[Discovery/research repo for the Learning center / Resources and support hub](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/69833737d9fe22b8990bb987e7c50de13205c5d5/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research)

**SME:** Danielle Thierry
- *Resources and support* questions and answers were determined based on SEO and contact center data
- *Resources and support* houses Tier 2 content, which is information-based (as opposed to Tier 1 content, which is action based)
- *Resources and support* is intended to provide more in-depth information/instructions around certain benefits and processes (both to provide the info and to lighten the content in the benefit hubs)
- *Resources and support* specifically addresses common issues such as signing in and verifying your identity

**SME:** Liz Lantz
- The "Learning center" is the same as the "Resources and support" hub, and they share the same [research repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/69833737d9fe22b8990bb987e7c50de13205c5d5/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research)
- [Resources and support card sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/69833737d9fe22b8990bb987e7c50de13205c5d5/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/resouces-and-support-card-sort-summary.pdf): user research determined the categorization of articles by topic
- Orginally two planned search methods: browse by topic, and browse by intended audience - only browsing by topic is currently available

### Method

Audit of [Resources and support](https://www.va.gov/resources/) hub to find relevant Veteran-facing language for each service, if present.

## Key Findings

1) **Most of what *Resources and support* offers does not align with *Facility Locator* benefits services**
    - *Resources and support* provides information on topics related to health care, personal information, and benefits. The *Facility Locator* lists benefit services: locations where Veterans can receive help with their benefits. While *Resources and support* contains step-by-step instructions for some actions, it rarely mentions how Veterans can receive help with performing any of the actions.

2) **A few "Other" benefits services are present under Resources and support**
  - A few services seem to be described in *Resources and support* articles that aren't captured by the *Facility Locator* list of services (see detailed findings), and they are:
    - Language and translation help
    - Help with changing your legal name
    - Help filing a discrimination claim

### Next Steps / Suggestions

- Consider revisiting the categorization of articles and topics, as some seem misplaced (ie. the "Health Care" topic only contains articles about travel reimbursement)
- Benefits services (ie. assistance with services, as opposed to information about those services) seems to be mostly out of scope for *Resources and support*. Consider creating a new topic category that includes benefits services.

## Detailed Findings

### Found some reference to:

#### Disability_Claim_assistance
- *Resources and support* references [filing a claim by mail or in person](https://www.va.gov/resources/your-intent-to-file-a-va-claim/) but does not mention any available assistance with filing or checking on the status of a claim.
#### eBenefits_Registration
  - (May not be directly related) [Help with upgrading to a premium account](https://www.va.gov/resources/get-a-premium-my-healthevet-account/): Veterans can get help upgrading to a premium account, in person, at VA health facilities.

- (May not be directly related) [Call for help with a late GI Bill payment](https://www.va.gov/resources/gi-bill-and-other-va-education-benefit-payments-faqs/): Veterans can call the listed number to speak to someone about a education payment they should have received
#### Updating_Direct_Deposit_Informa
- [Help with updating direct deposit information](https://www.va.gov/resources/direct-deposit-for-your-va-benefit-payments/)
  - Use of the phrase "Change your VA direct deposit information" as an alternative to "Updating..."
  - Veterans can update their information by phone or in person, but there is no direct reference to receiving assistance with this process
- (May not be directly related) [Help with opening a bank account](https://www.va.gov/resources/what-if-i-dont-have-a-bank-account-but-i-want-to-use-direct-deposit/)
  - References to the Veterans Benefits Banking Program (VBBP), which helps Veterans with banking actions
