# Research Plan - Non-Clinical Services Taxonomy

[Reviewed by Lauren Alexanderson on _____]

Research plan for [#XXX](URL)

## Background

In order to align the way services are presented to veterans across multiple pages in the Facilities Locator application, we are evaluating the current naming conventions of services. These services range from Homeless Assistance to Education Benefits (see the full list: [#32819](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/32819)). We will be evaluating the current taxonomy for ease-of-use.

## Research Goals

### Goals

Our main goals are:
- To determine how Veterans would categorize existing services
- Note any services that could benefit from updated plain language titles

### Research Questions

1) Do the existing categories accurately reflect Veteran expectations of where to find services on VBA Location pages?
2) Do Veterans commonly misunderstand any of the current labels?
3) Do existing category names cause confusion, or do they need to described using plainer language?

### Hypotheses

- Veterans will be able to find a VBA location that can help them with their desired services.
- Veterans will have trouble or lose confidence with the process
- Veterans will ask for clarification on the details of some labels
- Veterans will offer satisficing (suitable alternative routes) to achieving their desired tasks.

## Methodology

This study will be a moderated usability test featuring a scenario that pushes users towards VBA pages. Users will be allowed to talk about and expound upon alternative methods they would use to gather information around services, but they will eventually be asked to use a VBA Service details page to try and solve the problem.

## Recruitment and participants

Using Perigean recruiting, we would like to schedule **18 participants** to reach our goal of observing 10 participants. Participant criteria are as follows:

- **PRIMARY CRITERIA (must have)**
    - *Laptop or desktop computer only*
        - *For this study, mobile devices may introduce technical difficulties, or make it more difficult for participants to complete the task*
    - *Be able to screenshare via Zoom*
        - *Please confirm beforehand that participant is able to use Zoom, and is familiar with screen sharing*
    - *At least 2 participants under 35 years old*
    - *At least 2 participants over 55 years old*
    - *At least 1 participant with cognitive disabilities*
    - *At least 5 participants with no college degree or professional certificates*
    - *At least 3 participants of color*

- **SECONDARY CRITERIA (should have)**
    - *Mix of Veterans and Caregivers*
    - *All genders*
    - *A mix of rural and urban participants*

## Timeline and scheduling

**Pilot session:** January 13th, 3:00 PM EST

**Study dates:** January 17th - 28th

**Session length:** 1 hour, all times are EST

### Future research

- If participants struggle with any parts of the visual interfaces, we may want to dig into analytics to find similar patterns or follow-up with further usability studies.
