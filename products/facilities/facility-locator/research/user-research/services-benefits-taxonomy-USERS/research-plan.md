Research plan for #32819

## Background

In order to align the way services are presented to veterans across multiple pages in the
Facilities Locator application, we are evaluating the current naming conventions of services.
These services range from Homeless Assistance to Education Benefits (see the full list:
#32819). We will be evaluating the current taxonomy for ease-of-use.

## Research Goals

## Goals

*  Determine how the current categories are used by Veterans searching for services
*  Evaluate the usage of the service categories in the Filters list and Location Details pages
*  Note any services that could benefit from updated plain language titles

## Research Questions

1. Do the existing categories affect Veterans' ability to search for services?
2. Do existing category names cause confusion, or do they need to be described with more
    clear language?
3. How can the benefits services be best presented to Veterans?
4. What common knowledge or other strategies do Veterans utilize when searching for
    services?

## Hypotheses

*  Veterans will be able to find a VBA location that can help them with their desired
services.
*  Veterans will have trouble or lose confidence with the process
*  Veterans will ask for clarification on the details of some labels
*  Veterans will use satisficing (suitable alternative routes) to achieve their desired tasks.

## Methodology


This study will be a moderated usability test featuring a scenario that pushes users towards
VBA pages. Users will be allowed to talk about and elaborate on alternative methods they
would use to gather information around services, and they will eventually be asked to use a
VBA Service details page to try and solve the problem.

## Recruitment and participants


Using Perigean recruiting, we would like to schedule 18 participants to reach our goal of
observing 10 participants. Participant criteria are as follows:


### PRIMARY CRITERIA (must have)
*  Laptop or desktop computer only
*  For this study, mobile devices may introduce technical difficulties, or make it more difficult for participants to complete the task
*  Be able to screenshare via Zoom
*  Please confirm beforehand that participant is able to use Zoom, and is familiar with screen sharing
*  At least 2 participants under 35 years old
*  At least 2 participants over 55 years old
*  At least 1 participant with cognitive disabilities
*  At least 5 participants with no college degree or professional certificates
*  At least 3 participants of color

### SECONDARY CRITERIA (should have)
* Mix of Veterans and Caregivers
* All genders
* A mix of rural and urban participants

## Timeline and scheduling


Pilot session: January 20th, 3:00 PM EST

## Future research


*  If participants struggle with any parts of the visual interfaces, we may want to dig into
analytics to find similar patterns or follow-up with further usability studies.
