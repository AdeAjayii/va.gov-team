# Benefits Taxonomy Conversation Guide

[Reviewed by Lauren Alexanderson on ___]

## For note-takers

Complete verbatim transcripts may not be necessary for this study. The participants will be sharing a variety of unstructured information during the conversations that may be useful. This includes:

- Questions about the definitions of the benefits service categories
- Concerns about the clarity of language or visual elements they see on the page
- Confusion surrounding any navigation or wayfinding during the scenario
- Alternative routes they would take to find the requested information (other than Facilities Locator pages)

This information can be captured in short-form during the interviews and detailed from recordings during synthesis.

## Intro [5 minutes]

Hello, my name is Dave Sukharan and I'm a researcher with the VSA. We're hoping to make it easier for veterans and caregivers to find what they need and better understand the universe of services offered to them.  

Today, I'm going to have you walk-through a few scenarios as someone who is looking for help with services. During these scenarios, I can't emphasize enough how helpful it will to receive your honest and constant opinions. These are not a test of you, but of the 
resources that the VA offers. So, if you are confused, happy, surprised, or even irritated, please feel free to share.

- **This entire session is scheduled for 1 hour, but it may not take that long**.
- **There is no need to turn on your camera - if you prefer, audio only is fine**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
  - We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - [If yes]: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
  - [If no]: Alright, I will be writing or typing notes as we go.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

** **START RECORDING TO THE CLOUD** **

* **I have started recording.** 
  - I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?"

# Interview

## Warm-Up

1. For how long have you been out of active duty military?
2. Where, geographically, are you based right now?
3. How much experience do you have accessing your benefits and services with the VA?

## Main Interview

### Scenario 1 - General Wayfinding
Scenario Description: You are a veteran living in Washington D.C., you have a complicated question regarding your [college, house buying, diabetes care, career] needs. You've already done some research online, but still feel that you need help.

1. What are the next steps for you to find help? What first occured to you?
2. Have you taken similar steps in the past?

--- Redirect User if Necessary
Those are great solutions. For the purposes of this excercise, we are going to try and use the Facility Locator Tool to find a VBA location that would help with this service.
*Share Screen and display the Facility Locator Homepage*
Can you see the screen I have shared clearly?
**How would you find help with these services using this page?**

The "Correct" Path:
1. Enter Zip Code or City (20001, Washington D.C., prompt the user if necessary)
2. Choose Facility Type: VA Benefits
3. Choose Service Type: Education and Career counseling, or VA Home Loan Help, or IDES
4. View Locations
5. Stop the user there for Reflection Questions:
  1. What are you thinking as you go through these services?
  2. I saw you hesitate on XXXX, what does this service mean to you?
  3. Are there any categories that you wanted more clarity on?
  4. Were there any other categories that you were tempted to choose?

### Scenario 2 - Location Specific Page
Scenario Description: You are a veteran living in Washington D.C., you have a complicated question regarding your [college, house buying, diabetes care, career] needs. You've found a VBA location that seems like it can help with these questions and are now viewing their web page.

*Share Screen and display a specific facility details page*
Can you see the screen I have shared clearly?

**Can this location help with your request?**

1. On this page, are there any services that you find confusing or that require clarification?
2. You mentioned the XYZ service category, what does that label mean to you?
3. How confident would you be in the information provided on this page?
4. What other steps would you take to answer your questions after viewing this page?
