# Benefits Taxonomy Conversation Guide


[Reviewed by Lauren Alexanderson on ___]

# Pre-Interview

## For note-takers

```
Complete verbatim transcripts may not be necessary for this study. The participants will
be sharing a variety of unstructured information during the conversations that may be
useful.
```

This includes:
* Questions about the definitions of the benefits service categories
* Concerns about the clarity of language or visual elements they see on the page
* Alternative routes they would take to find the requested information (other than
Facilities Locator pages)


This information can be captured in short-form during the interviews and detailed from
recordings during synthesis.

# Introduction

```
Hello, my name is Dave Sukharan and I'm a researcher working with the VA.gov team.
We're hoping to make it easier for veterans and caregivers to find what they need and
better understand the universe of services offered to them.


Today, I'm going to have you walk-through a few scenarios as someone who is looking
for help with services. During these scenarios, I can't emphasize enough how helpful it
will be to receive your honest opinions often. These are not a test of you, but of the
resources that the VA offers. So, if you are confused, happy, surprised, or even irritated,
please feel free to share.
```

* This entire session is scheduled for 1 hour, but it may not take that long.
* There is no need to turn on your camera - if you prefer, audio only is fine
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
* We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions
accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and
none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
* [If yes]: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with
me recording this session once more.
* [If no]: Alright, I will be writing or typing notes as we go.

```
If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me
know.
```

**START RECORDING TO THE CLOUD**

```
I have started recording.
I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio
as we talk today?"

# Main Interview

## Warm-Up

1. For how long have you been out of active duty military?
2. Where, geographically, are you based right now?
3. Can you tell me about a time you’ve utilized a VA service? (Example: applied for
    a home loan, received education or medical benefits, etc.)
       a. Note: Potentially use this experience for the scenario
4. Are you familiar with VA.gov, and if so, what do you typically use it for?


## Scenario 1 - Search Page Evaluation

### Research Questions to Address

1. Do existing category names cause confusion, or do they need to be described with more
    clear language?
2. What common knowledge or other strategies do Veterans utilize when searching for
    services?

### Scenario Description:
```
You are a veteran living in Washington D.C., you have a complicated question
regarding your [college, house buying, diabetes care, career] needs.
You've already done some research online, but still feel that you need help.

What are the next steps for you to find help?
```
### Prodding Questions:
1. What first occurred to you?
2. Have you taken similar steps in the past?

_Give the user 3-5 minutes to walkthrough their thoughts. Redirect them if necessary._

```
Those are great solutions. For the purposes of this exercise, we are going to try and use the Facility Locator Tool to find a VBA location that would help with this service.

At this point, could you share your screen using Zoom? Please select the green icon at the bottom of this video call screen. Before you share, please make sure there is no sensitive information on your screen.
```

_Give the participant 5 minutes to complete their screenshare. If the participant cannot screenshare, share your screen instead and navigate to the Facility Locator portal. Allow the participant to “pilot” by giving you instructions on what they would do._

### The "Correct" Path:

1. Enter Zip Code or City (20001, Washington D.C., prompt the user if necessary)
2. Choose Facility Type: VA Benefits
3. Choose Service Type: Education and Career counseling, or VA Home Loan Help,
    or IDES
4. View Locations

#### Prodding Questions:
1. What are you thinking as you go through these services?
2. I saw you hesitate on XXXX, what does this service mean to you?
3. Are there any categories that you wanted more clarity on?
4. Were there any other categories that you were tempted to choose?


## Scenario 2 - Location Specific Page Evaluation

### Research Questions to Address

1. Do existing category names cause confusion, or do they need to be described with more
    clear language?
2. What common knowledge or other strategies do Veterans utilize when searching for
    services?

### Scenario Description:
```
You are a veteran living in Washington D.C., you have a complicated question
regarding your [college, house buying, diabetes care, career] needs.
You've found a VBA location that seems like it can help with these questions
and are now viewing their web page
```

_Ask participant to share their screen again, if necessary. Navigate them to the [Baltimore VA Regional Benefits Office](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_313) page._

**Can this location help with your request?**

### Prodding Questions
1. On this page, are there any services that you find confusing or that require clarification?
2. You mentioned the XYZ service name, what does that label mean to you?
3. How confident would you be in the information provided on this page?
4. What other steps would you take to answer your questions after viewing this page?


## Scenario 3 - Category Name Evaluation
_If time permits, take participants through a simple card sorting exercise._

### Research Questions to Address
1. Do existing category names cause confusion, or do they need to be described with more clear language?
2. How can the benefits services be best presented to Veterans?

_Ask participants to end their screenshare, if necessary. Navigate to the [Card Sort Page](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1641416955140/49022b3f69f3e814bf3e33cf24cdc2f02273db60). Share your own screen._

```
Can you see my screen alright? I’ll be walking us through a short activity to make sure
we’ve captured all of your thoughts on the names of these services.

On the left hand side, we have a list of terms, these are the names of services offered
by the VA. On the right hand side, we have three boxes labeled Clear, Neutral, and
Unclear. I’d like you to sort the terms into these three boxes based on whether you feel
like the service name is clear and easy to understand or unclear and difficult to
understand.

I will be doing the clicking and dragging, so please talk me through your decisions and
whether or not you have any questions along the way.
```

### Prodding Questions:
* Why did you categorize this service name here?
* Tell me more about that.
* What other terms have you heard to describe that service?
* What does that name tell you about the services offered?


# Closing

Thank you so much for your time and for your help today!

* Did you have any questions for the team?

We're excited to take this information into developing easier to use systems for veterans
everywhere.

* Did you have any resources or other contacts that you believe we should talk
with?

**STOP Recording**

* Was there anything you wanted to tell us about Benefits and services that we
didn't get to cover today?
