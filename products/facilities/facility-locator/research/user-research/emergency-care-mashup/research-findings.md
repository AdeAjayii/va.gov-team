## Research Goals 

The goal of this study is to validate the usability and design of the new facility locator emergency care search options and results:
 - Participants to understand all of the emergency care facility options available to them
 - Validate that the design sufficiently informs participants about community care emergency benefits
 - Participants to understand what "in-network" means in terms of VA and non-VA community partners

## Research Methodology 

A remote, via Zoom, moderated task-based usability study was conducted between May 17th - May 25th, 2021. Participants were asked to describe their thought processes during an open-ended facility locator search task. Participatants were also asked specific questions about individual search options and elements on the facility locator page. Note-takers and observers were also in attendance.

### Who we talked to

- 9 total participants
  - 8 Veterans
  - 1 Caregiver
  - 3 urban, and 6 rural participants
  - 1 transgender, 6 male, and 2 female participants
  - 4 age 35 - 44, 3 aged 55 - 64, 1 age 65 - 74, and 1 age unknown 

### Research Questions

- What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?
- What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?
- Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?
- Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?
- Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?
- What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?

## Key Findings

- Most participants expressed a desire for clear benefits information and procedures to be associated with search results.
  - A few participants expressed desire for an explicit list of available services per location in search results.
  - Some participants wanted search results to include all available (out-of-network) facilities, and emphasized proximity as the main factor in choosing a location, even if they were not in-network.
