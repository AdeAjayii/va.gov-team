## Research Goals 

The goal of this study is to validate the usability and design of the new facility locator emergency care search options and results:
 - Participants to understand all of the emergency care facility options available to them
 - Validate that the design sufficiently informs participants about community care emergency benefits
 - Participants to understand what "in-network" means in terms of VA and non-VA community partners

## Research Methodology 

A remote, via Zoom, moderated task-based usability study was conducted between May 17th - May 25th, 2021. Participants were asked to describe their thought processes during an open-ended facility locator search task. Participatants were also asked specific questions about individual search options and elements on the facility locator page. Note-takers and observers were also in attendance.

### Who we talked to

- 8 Veterans
- 1 Caregiver
- 3 urban, and 6 rural participants
- 1 transgender, 6 male, and 2 female participants
- 4 age 35 - 44, 3 aged 55 - 64, 1 age 65 - 74, and 1 age unknown 

### Research Questions

- What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?
- What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?
- Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?
- Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?
- Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?
- What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?

## Key Findings

**What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?**

- Most participants expressed a desire for clear benefits information and procedures to be associated with search results.
- Most participants emphasized the importance of finding the closest location.
- A few participants expressed desire for an explicit list of available services per location in search results.
- Some participant wanted search results to include all available (out-of-network) facilities,  and emphasized proximity as the main factor in choosing a location.

**What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?**

- Nearly all participants wanted clearer and more easily accessible information about their benefits at community partners to be present in search results.

**Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?**

- Most participants noticed the blue info alert associated with community partners, but it was unclear if they knew it was *only* associated with community partners.
- Some participants quickly distinguished between location types by noticing the blue info alert associated with community partner results, and the presence of "VA" in the title of VA facilities.

**Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?**

- Most participants understood that "in-network" meant VA and VA partner facilities, and that the search results reflected this.
- As a result of personal experience, most participants expressed awareness that they could visit any emergency facility.
- One participant expressed a desire for a more explicit "out-of-network" search option, to include non VA facilities.

**Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?**

- Only two participants out of eight clicked on the blue info alert.
- Most participants noticed the alert, but either did not intuitively recognize it as access to additional information about their benefits, or were simply unwilling to click it during the demo.

**What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?**

- Participants had a range of responses, including:
     - A clear understanding of services offered at the location
     - Clear and easily accessible benefits information
     - Clear and easily accessible information on the procedure for applying for benefits
     - Reviews of the facility
