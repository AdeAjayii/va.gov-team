## Research Goals 

The goal of this study is to validate the usability and design of the new facility locator emergency care search options and results:
 - Participants to understand all of the emergency care facility options available to them
 - Validate that the design sufficiently informs participants about community care emergency benefits
 - Participants to understand what "in-network" means in terms of VA and non-VA community partners

## Methodology 

A remote, via Zoom, moderated task-based usability study was conducted between May 17th - May 25th, 2021. Participants were asked to describe their thought processes during an open-ended facility locator search task. Participatants were also asked specific questions about individual search options and elements on the facility locator page. Note-takers and observers were also in attendance.

### Who we talked to

- 9 total participants
  - 8 Veterans
  - 1 Non Veteran caregiver
  - 1 with identified cognitive disabilities
  - 3 urban, and 6 rural participants
  - 1 transgender, 6 male, and 2 female participants
  - 4 age 35 - 44, 3 aged 55 - 64, 1 age 65 - 74, and 1 age unknown 

### Research Questions

a) What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?

b) What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?

c) Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?

d) Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?

e) Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?

f) What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?

### Hypotheses

i) Veterans want to search for a single list, containing both VA and community emergency care options.

ii) Veterans understand they can go to any local emergency room, not just those in the results list.

iii) Veterans understand that the Facility Locator list contains "in-network" VA and community care facilities, and is not comprehensive: it may not represent all emergency options available to them.

iv) The facility type label "In-network emergency care" does not introduce confusion about other facility types.

v) Veterans understand how to learn more about [community care emergency benefit](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/veterans/Emergency_Care.asp)

vi) Participants will understand what to do in case of emergency

## Key Findings

### Research Questions

a) Participants fell into three main categories: a desire for information about the specific services provided at each location, a desire to see the closest facility whether in-network or out-of-network, and a desire for more information about the benefits procedure at specific locations.

b) Most participants wanted clearer and more easily accessible information about their benefits at community partners to be accessible via search results.

c) It was unclear if most participants were able to quickly distinguish between VA locations and community partners in the results list. Some participants did note the distinction, based on the presence of the blue info alert for community partners, and the presence of "VA" in the title of VA facilities.

d) Most participants recognized that "in-network" search results contained only VA and VA partners, but it was unclear if most participants understood that "out-of-network" locations would not appear in the search results. Some participants were explicit about wanting to see "out-of-network" locations in the search results.

e) Only two participants clicked on the blue info alert present in search results. Most participants noticed the alert, but either did not intuitively recognize it as access to additional information about benefits, or were simply unwilling to click it during the demo.

f) Participants had a range of responses, the most notable included: a clear understanding of available services at the facility, clear and easily accessible benefits information, and the distance to the location.

### Hypotheses

i) Likely: most participants seemed to choose "All in-network" before other options, and some noted the usefulness of the VA and VA community partners distinction.

ii) Likely: from personal experience, most participants seemed to be aware of this, and not necessarily because of anything on the facility locator page.

iii) Likely: most participants recognized "in-network" as meaning only connected to the VA, including explicity VA facilities.

iv) False: it's presence in the "Facility type" and "Service type" dropdowns did introduce confusion.

v) Unlikely: while most participants noticed the blue info alert associated with community partners, only two out of eight clicked on the link. Some participants stated that they would call the facility or a patient advocate to learn more, and most did not seem to recognize access to more information present in the search results.

vi) True: from personal experience, and not necessarily information in the search results, most participants knew to immediately find medical attention.

## Details of Findings

### Research Questions Details

a) What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?

> [P1] "There should be an option that says, 'learn more about what the facility offers'...click on that to learn more"

> [P6] "It would be nice to have something to each with the services offered to be hyper linked to each one."

> [P4] "If I need emergency care then I may be willing to go somewhere that is out of network."

> [P11] "If someone is in an emergency then they may want to go to the closest place regardless of [it being] in VA's network"

> [P14] "I would look more at distance if it were an emergency."

b) What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?

> [P1] "How would I learn more about my benefits...I don't see a way to do that."

> [P5] "[You] can't go to them unless you are already authorized. [If you] believe you can go there directly you will get a bill."

> [P11] "I would also choose that to see if other community care providers are covered through the VA before traveling farther to another VA location."

c) Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?

> [P4] "I don't know why two of the results have [blue info alert] and the other two don't...I just realized the bottom two are VA."

> [P11] "It also says that the top two are in-network...if I were too far from a VA hospital then I could go to one of [these]."

d) Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?

> [P4] "It's weird there is only an in-network emergency care and not also out-of-network emergency care"

e) Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?

> [P2] "...[referencing info alert] seems more like an information section than an alert...seem[s] like somewhere you can go to get more info."

f) What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?

> [P6] "...services offered to by hyper linked on each one...I would like a link here."

> [P4] "I would do a quick search for review...I would rather go to a civilian hospital...normally better care."

### Hypotheses Details

ii) Veterans understand they can go to any local emergency room, not just those in the results list.

## Additional Insights

- Most partictipant's first choice during the open-ended search task was "Urgent Care" under the "Facility type" dropdown (5/9)
  - "VA Health" under the "Facility type" dropdown was the second most picked first-choice option (3/9)

## Recommendations

[Initial recommendations - may change]

- Change "In-network emergency care" to "Emergency care"
