## Research Goals 

The goal of this study is to validate the usability and design of the new facility locator emergency care search options and results:
 - Participants to understand all of the emergency care facility options available to them
 - Validate that the design sufficiently informs participants about community care emergency benefits
 - Participants to understand what "in-network" means in terms of VA and non-VA community partners

## Research Methodology 

A remote, via Zoom, moderated task-based usability study was conducted between May 17th - May 25th, 2021. Participants were asked to describe their thought processes during an open-ended facility locator search task. Participatants were also asked specific questions about individual search options and elements on the facility locator page. Note-takers and observers were also in attendance.

### Who we talked to

- 9 total participants
  - 8 Veterans
  - 1 Caregiver
  - 3 urban, and 6 rural participants
  - 1 transgender, 6 male, and 2 female participants
  - 4 age 35 - 44, 3 aged 55 - 64, 1 age 65 - 74, and 1 age unknown 

### Research Questions

a) What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?

b) What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?

c) Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?

d) Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?

e) Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?

f) What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?

## Key Findings

a) Most participants expressed a desire for clear benefits information. Most participants also emphasized the importance of finding the closest location, and some were explicit about wanting non-VA locations to be present in search results, in case they were closer than VA locations.

b) Most participants wanted clearer and more easily accessible information about their benefits at community partners to be present in search results.

c) It was unclear if most participants were able to quickly distinguish between VA locations and community partners in the results list. Some participants did note the distinction, based on the presence of the blue info alert for community partners, and the presence of "VA" in the title of VA facilities.

d) Most participants recognized that "in-network" search results contained only VA and VA partners, but it was unclear if most participants understood that "out-of-network" locations would not appear in the search results. Some participants were explicit about wanting to see "out-of-network" locations in the search results.

e) Only two participants clicked on the blue info alert present in search results. Most participants noticed the alert, but either did not intuitively recognize it as access to additional information about benefits, or were simply unwilling to click it during the demo.

f) Participants had a range of responses, the most notable included: a clear understanding of available services at the facility, clear and easily accessible benefits information, and the distance to the location.
