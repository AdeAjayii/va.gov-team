## Research Goals 

The goal of this study is to validate the usability and design of the new facility locator emergency care search options and results:
 - Participants to understand all of the emergency care facility options available to them
 - Validate that the design sufficiently informs participants about community care emergency benefits
 - Participants to understand what "in-network" means in terms of VA and non-VA community partners

## Research Methodology 

A remote, via Zoom, moderated task-based usability study was conducted between May 17th - May 25th, 2021. Participants were asked to describe their thought processes during an open-ended facility locator search task. Participatants were also asked specific questions about individual search options and elements on the facility locator page. Note-takers and observers were also in attendance.

### Who we talked to

- 9 total participants
  - 8 Veterans
  - 1 Caregiver
  - 3 urban, and 6 rural participants
  - 1 transgender, 6 male, and 2 female participants
  - 4 age 35 - 44, 3 aged 55 - 64, 1 age 65 - 74, and 1 age unknown 

### Research Questions

a) What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?
b) What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?
c) Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?
d) Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?
e) Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?
f) What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?

## Key Findings

a) Most participants expressed a desire for clear benefits information and procedures. Participants also emphasized the importance of finding the cloest location.
b) Most participants emphasized the importance of finding the closest available facility.
c) It was unclear if participants were able to quickly distinguish between VA locations and community partners in the results list.
d) It was unclear if participants recognized that the results list was not comprehensive.
- Most participants recognized that "in-network" meant VA locations or community partners, and that search results would reflect this.
- Most participants noticed, but did not click on, the community care benefits info alert present in search results.
