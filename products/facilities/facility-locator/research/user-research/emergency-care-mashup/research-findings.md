## Research Goals 

The goal of this study is to validate the usability and design of the new facility locator emergency care search options and results:
 - Participants to understand all of the emergency care facility options available to them
 - Validate that the design sufficiently informs participants about community care emergency benefits
 - Participants to understand what "in-network" means in terms of VA and non-VA community partners

## Methodology 

A remote, via Zoom, moderated task-based usability study was conducted between May 17th - May 25th, 2021. Participants were asked to describe their thought processes during an open-ended facility locator search task. Participatants were also asked specific questions about individual search options and elements on the facility locator page. Note-takers and observers were also in attendance.

## Research Findings

### Research Questions

a) What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?

  - Participants fell into three main categories: 
    - A desire for information about the specific services provided at each location
    - A desire to see the closest facility whether in-network or out-of-network
    - A desire for more information about the benefits procedure at specific locations.

b) What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?

  - Most participants wanted clearer and more easily accessible information about their benefits at community partners to be accessible via search results.

c) Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?

  - It was unclear if most participants were able to quickly distinguish between VA locations and community partners in the results list. 

d) Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?

  - Most participants recognized that search results only inlcluded in-network locations. 

e) Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?

  - Most participants did not click to learn more about community care benefits.

f) What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?

  - Participants had a range of responses, including: 
    - A clear understanding of available services at the facility
    - Clear and easily accessible benefits information
    - Distance to the closest location

### Hypotheses

i) Veterans want to search for a single list, containing both VA and community emergency care options.

  -  **True:** participants wanted to see as many options as possible (8/9 participants)

ii) Veterans understand they can go to any local emergency room, not just those in the results list.

  - **False:** this was not gleaned from search results, however participants knew this from personal experience (2/9 participants pointed out emergency alert)

iii) Veterans understand that the Facility Locator list contains "in-network" VA and community care facilities, and is not comprehensive: it may not represent all emergency options available to them.

  - **True:** most participants knew search results were in-network only (7/9 participants)

iv) The facility type label "In-network emergency care" does not introduce confusion about other facility types.

  - **False:** this label did introduce confusion (3/9 participants expressed confusion about facility types)

v) Veterans understand how to learn more about [community care emergency benefit](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/veterans/Emergency_Care.asp)

  - **False:** most participants did not see a way to learn more about their benefits (2/9 clicked on benefits link)

vi) Participants will understand what to do in case of emergency

  - **Mostly false:** this was not gleaned from search results, however participants knew this from personal experience (5/9 participants referenced previous experience)

## Details & Quotes

### Research Questions Details

a) What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?

- When seeking emergency care, participants wanted information about services offered, to see the closest available facilities, and clearer information about their benefits.

  - Most participants fell into these three main categories of need. Some participants expressed desire for a direct link to services offered to be present in the search results.
 
    > [P1] "There should be an option that says, 'learn more about what the facility offers'...click on that to learn more"
    
    > [P6] "It would be nice to have something to each with the services offered to be hyper linked to each one."

  - Rural participants were particularly conscious of distance, and participants seemed more willing to visit whichever locations was closest, even if it was not in VA’s network.

    > [P4] "If I need emergency care then I may be willing to go somewhere that is out of network."

    > [P10] "I live further away from the facilities...I need to figure out which is the closest."

    > [P11] "If someone is in an emergency then they may want to go to the closest place regardless of [it being] in VA's network"
    
    > [P14] "I would look more at distance if it were an emergency."

b) What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?

- When seeking emergency care at community partners, participants wanted clearer and more easily accessible benefits information.

  - Nearly all participants expressed frustration with the process of validating their benefits at community partners. 

    > [P2] "Sometimes I don't know what to tell non-VA centers except to bill it through Tricare."
    
    > [P5] "I did not know what was expected me, and I don't think the website [in general] addresses that."

  - Some participants also expressed a desire for direct link to benefits information to be present in search results.

    > [P6] "I would like a link here, 'in-network emergency care benefits'
    
    > [P1] "How would I learn more about my benefits...I don't see a way to do that."

c) Can Veterans distinguish between these location types in a single list?

- It was unclear if most participants were able to quickly distinguish between VA locations and community partners in the results list.

  - Some participants did note the distinction, and based it on the presence of the blue info alert for community partners, and the presence of "VA" in the title of VA facilities.

    > [P4] "I don't know why two of the results have [blue info alert] and the other two don't...I just realized the bottom two are VA."
    
    > [P11] "It also says that the top two are in-network...if I were too far from a VA hospital then I could go to one of [these]."

d) Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?

- Most participants understood that search results only included in-network locations.

  - Most participants seemed to realize that there were more locations available, and most understood “in-network” to mean only VA and VA partners.

    > [P2] "If I am on a VA website, it is anything that is covered by the government...not including third party facilities"

  - One participant expressed an explicit desire to have out-of-network results in the search list.

    > [P4] "It's weird there is only an in-network emergency care and not also out-of-network emergency care"

e) Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits?

- Most participants did not click to learn more about community care benefits.

  - Most participants noticed the alert, but either did not intuitively recognize it as access to additional information, or were simply unwilling to click it during the demo. Only two participants clicked on the blue info alert present in search results.

    > [P1] "How would I learn more about my benefits and the types of care that a facility offers...I don't see a way to do that"
    
    > [P2] "...[referencing info alert] seems more like an information section...seem[s] like somewhere you can go to get more info."
    
    > [P6] "I would assume if I clicked here...any of those would [point] me towards the facility...looks easy to click the benefit link"
    
    > [P10] "I just thought it was information, nothing that would give me [more] information"

f) What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?

- When preparing to go to an emergency facility, participants wanted a clear understanding of services offered, clearer information about benefits, and distance to the closest location.

  - Participants expressed similar desires to the question, “What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?” 

  - Two participants  expressed the desire to see the review of a facility before going there, noting that they had had better experiences at local community partners.

    > [P4] "I would do a quick search for review...I would rather go to a civilian hospital...normally better care."
    
    > [P5] "I would suggest having reviews of the facilities...maybe pros and cons. VA emergency care is an oxymoron, give me a break."

### Hypotheses Details

i) Veterans want to search for a single list, containing both VA and community emergency care options.

> [P6] "I don't know why I would exclude a VA facility...I don't know if I would go to the last one, because to get this info I would just click all in-network."

> [P2] "It seems like it's redundant, but for a specific purpose - you may not get many results if you chose third [in-network community care] option."

ii) Veterans understand they can go to any local emergency room, not just those in the results list.

> [P2] "...ER is still covered 100%...even if I'm not able to get to the VA."

iii) Veterans understand that the Facility Locator list contains "in-network" VA and community care facilities, and is not comprehensive: it may not represent all emergency options available to them.

> [P2]"If I am on a VA website, it is anything that is covered by the government...not including third party facilities."

> [P4] "I would assume that all results...would be in-network."

iv) The facility type label "In-network emergency care" does not introduce confusion about other facility types.

- Participants understood the specific phrase "in-network" but juxtaposed with other "Facility type" options, it introduced confusion.

> [P4] "I would change in-network to ER."

> [P5] "Does in-network mean Medicare and how does the VA dovetail?", "To me that was confusing...I don't know what that means. Does that only mean VA or you can go to the rural clinic but you have to call? That is not clear at all," "...in-network emergency care, to me that is a stumbling block...I would want to hit emergency care, then have the explanation."

> [P14] "I would probably be a little confused. Is it all together? Is it any VA facility choice program that will work with the VA?"

v) Veterans understand how to learn more about [community care emergency benefit](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/veterans/Emergency_Care.asp)

> [P1] "How would I learn more about my benefits and the types of care that a facility offers...I don't see a way to do that", ""I would just call...the patient advocate. They know what is offered at the center."

> [P2] "...it seem[s] like somewhere you can go to get more info."

> [P10] "I would call the number to talk to the person...I just thought it [blue alert] was information, nothing that would give me [more] information."

> [P11] "The blue info notice means I can go there...they will accept Veteran's insurance."

vi) Participants will understand what to do in case of emergency

> [P2] "...ER is still covered 100%...even if I'm not able to get to the VA."

> [P4] "But if I go to a non-VA center then I'm supposed to call ahead to get approval...unless it's life or death."

> [P6] "Common sense if you have an emergency, call 911."

> [P14] "I can always take him to the hospital, but there are issues..."

## Additional Insights

- Most partictipant's first choice during the open-ended search task was "Urgent Care" under the "Facility type" dropdown (5/9)
  - "VA Health" under the "Facility type" dropdown was the second most picked first-choice option (3/9)

- For most participants, the main distinction between "urgent" and "emergency" seemed to be non-life threatening out-patient emergencies, vs potentially life-threatening in-patient emergencies.
  
  > [P1] "Urgent care means you need care in that moment, but it's not a matter of life or death. Emergency care is a matter of life or death."

  > [P2] "I think the fine line difference is whether it's life or death."

- Very few participants pointed out the yellow emergency alert, and one participant stated that she noticed the blue info alert in the search results before the yellow.

  > [P5] "[referecing yellow alert]...it's fine, but the blue caught my eye faster."

## Recommendations

[Initial recommendations - may change]

- Change "In-network emergency care" under Facility type, to "Emergency care"
  - Veterans can choose VA or community partners under "Service type"
- Make the blue info link more recognizable as a call to action
  - Change text to "Learn more about your benefits"
- Change the yellow emergency alert to blue

## Next Steps

- Update design spec with recommendations
