## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! 
My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 
Today we're going to talk about finding healthcare on the VA.gov website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

* **This entire session should take about 45 minutes**.
* **First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started**.
* **Then, I'll be sharing a link to a prototype and ask you to share your screen. We'll look at a protoype together and I will ask you questions about it**.
  * This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect
  * Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. 
  * Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. 
  * We are not testing you, or your ability, instead, we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. 
  * You cannot do anything wrong. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
  * If no: *[TBD?]*
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

### START RECORDING TO THE CLOUD

* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions - 3 minutes

* Can you tell me a little about your service history?
* Have you visited the VA for healthcare in the past year?
    * If yes: can you tell me about that experience?

## Usability Test - 25 minutes

I'm going to share a link to a prototype here in the zoom chat window for you to click on. 
Then I'll want you to share your screen so that I can follow along and see what you see.

### MODERATOR SHARES LINK TO PROTOTYPE
[UXPin Link](https://preview.uxpin.com/8767aa9028468a26be090fd044d9ff26e40a8f95#/pages/138402705/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)

Since this is only a prototype some links and features will work but most won't. 
I ask that you think out loud as much as possible, as we go through the prototype.


### PROTOTYPE: Facility Locator
#### Questions:

- Are you familiar with, or have you ever used VA.gov's location finder? 
    - If yes: how long ago, what were you doing? What was that experience like?
    - If no: how do you go about finding information about VA locations?

- Have you ever visited an emergency care clinic in the past (VA or non-VA)?
    - If yes: can you tell me about that?
    - (VA/non-VA location? Why that one? How did you find it?)
    - (What is your understanding of your benefit coverge in the event of an emergency?)

### Scenario
#### Directions:

I'm going to walk us through a scenario and have you perform a couple tasks. 
Again, this is only a prototype so some things might not work as expected. 
As you work through the tasks I'd like you to think out loud and narrate what you see and what goes through your mind.

I'd like you to imagine that you live in Denver, CO. You are coming to this site because you would like to learn more about the closest locations that offer emergency care services.

### Task 1

#### PROTOTYPE: Open-ended search results
#### Questions:

Perform a search for nearby locations that have emergency care services.
  - (Point out steps, probe throught process):
  - Can you walk me through that process?
  - Tell me about what you see in this results list.

Based on the results of your search, what is important to you when choosing a location from this list?

Let's say you want to search for [All / VA / Community locations] in your area.
  - (Point out steps, probe throught process):
  - Can you walk me through the process?
  - Tell me about what you see in this results list.
  - Does the distinction between this results list, and the previous results list, matter to you?

### Task 2

#### PROTOTYPE: User understands the different search options
#### Questions:

What does the distinction between 'Facility type' and 'Service type' mean to you?

For this task, under the 'Facility type' menu, I'd like you to choose 'In-network emergency care'.
  - When you see the phrase 'In-network', what does that mean to you?
  - When you see "emergency care", what kinds of facilities might you expect to see in the search results?

Open the 'Service type' menu, talk me through what the different options mean to you.
   - What does 'All in-network emergency care' mean to you?
   - What does 'VA emergency care' mean to you?
   - What does 'In-network community emergency care' mean to you?

Does the distinction between 'Service type' options matter to you?
   - What matters about the distinction?

### Scenario

Here's one more scenario: [TBD - actual emergency?]

#### PROTOTYPE: 
#### Questions:


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

I have just a couple more questions before we finish up:

- Can you think of anything that would make this website easier for you to use next time?
- Is there anything that I haven't asked you that you think that I should know?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. 
Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
