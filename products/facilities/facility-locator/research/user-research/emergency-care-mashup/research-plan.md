# Research Plan: Emergency Care Mashup Study 

## Goals
The goal of this study is to validate the usability and design of new facility locator search result cards which combine VA emergency care and community emergency care service types.

#### Hypothesis

- Veterans want to search for a single list, containing both VA and community emergency care options
- Veterans understand they can go to any local emergency room, not just those in the results list
- Veterans understand that the Facility Locator list contains "in-network" emergency care facilities, rather than a comprehensive list 
- The facility type label "In-network emergency care" helps Veterans understand the results list is not comprehensive
- The facility type lable "In-network emergency care" does not introduce confusion about other facility types
- Veterans understand how to learn more about community care emergency benefit (explained elsewhere)

#### Research questions

- What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking emergency care?
- What information do Veterans need/want for community emergency care (in VA network) locations?
- Can Veretans distinguish between these location types in a single list?
- Do Veterans understand that there are more locations available, than are present in the "in-network" results list?
- Would Veterans click to learn more about community emergency care benefits? 
- Do Veterans find labels such as those indicating emergency care service/facility type helpful when finding/selecting an emergency care location?
- What information does a Veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a emergency care facility?

## Method

Remote, moderated usability testing will be used to gain feedback on the design of facility locator search result that will combine cards for VA emergency care and community emergency care. The study will validate that the new designs will allow:
 - participants to understand all of the emergency care facility options available to them.
 - validate that the new design would sufficiently inform them about emergency care benefits.

We will be testing a [UXPin prototype] via Zoom. These sessions will include a short interview with the participant.

## Participants and recruitment

We will utilize the Perigean contract recruiting. We'd like to schedule 15 participants to reach our goal of observing **10** participants.

Participant Criteria:

- All genders
- A mix of rural and urban

- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person with cognitive disabilities
- Laptop or desktop computer
- Be able to screenshare via Zoom. Please confirm with them that they have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screenshare.
