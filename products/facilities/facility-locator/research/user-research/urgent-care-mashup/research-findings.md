# Research Findings: Urgent Care Mashup Study
**Digital Services Veterans Affairs (DSVA), VSA, Facility Locator**<br>

## Research Goals 

Today, when a Veteran uses VA.gov's Facility Locator to find urgent care locations, they must choose between 'VA urgent care' or 'Community urgent care providers (in VA’s network)' individually to see all of the options available to them. When users choose 'Community urgent care providers (in VA’s network)', the page displays an alert banner notifying them about VA's community urgent care benefit. 

The tool will be adding an 'All urgent care' default option to the 'Choose a service type' menu so that users can see all options available to them in one list simultaneously. In making this change, the page will need to find a new way to alert users of VA's community urgent care benefit.

The goal of this study was to: 
- Understand how an 'All urgent care' option might influence the way a user searches for urgent care
- Determine whether or not the new design support users in understanding all of the urgent care options available to them

Prior to the study, we hypothesized that:
- Veterans will understand how to find an urgent care location.
- Veterans will want to filter urgent care locations by facility type, va/non-va to inform their decision.
- Veterans will understand how to prepare for a visit to an urgent care facility.

## Research Methodology 

Remote, moderated sessions were conducted via Zoom and included a combination of usability testing and generative questioning.

### Who we talked to

8 Participants:
* 6 Veterans, 2 Caretakers, 1 Veteran/Caretaker 
* Ages ranges; 1-(45-64), 5-(55-64), 1-(65-74), 1(undisclosed)
* 4 Rural, 3 Urban, 1 undisclosed
* 3 participants with cognitive disabilities
* Educational backgrounds ranged from high school diploma to master's degree

### Research Questions

- What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking urgent care?
- What information do Veterans need/want for community urgent care (in VA network) locations?
- Do Veterans need/want to distinguish between these location types in a single list?
- Do veterans want to filter by facility type, va/non-va?
- Would veterans click to learn more about community urgent care benefits?
- Do veterans find labels such as those indicating urgent care service/facility type helpful when finding/selecting an urgent care location?
- What information does a veteran find helpful in preparing to go to a urgent care facility?


## Findings

### Findings by Hypothesis

* Veterans will understand how to find an urgent care location.
  * Finding: 
* Veterans will want to filter urgent care locations by facility type, va/non-va to inform their decision.
* Veterans will understand how to prepare for a visit to an urgent care facility.

### Key Findings

1. 7 out of 8 Participants did not know about the Community urgent care benefit.
2. Participants understood “Urgent care benefit information” is something they should click. 
3. Facilities with statuses stating "Limited services and hours” were interpreted as being less available or having fewer services than those with “Call for services and hours”.
4. Veterans use “in network”, “outside” and “civilian” to describe VA and non-VA options.
5. Veterans don’t believe it's up to them to decide where to go for urgent care. 
6. ½ of all participants filtered urgent care options by “VA health”. 
7. Close proximity is a crucial factor when choosing urgent care.
8. Lack of visual affordances impacts how users perceive page data and functionality. 
9. Veterans did not seek out labels like “Retail” or “VA health” to identify the facility type. 
10. Two Veterans specifically asked for wait times to be surfaced in search results.

### Details of Findings

**1. 7 out of 8 Participants did not know about the Community urgent care benefit.**<br> 
3 participants expressed strong emotions in just learning that this benefit was available to them, all adding that they wished that they had received an email about it. One suggested using "marketing schemes" to educate veterans about the benefit. By the end of each session, all would consider going to Community urgent care if it made sense in their situation.

>  P3(AI-get exact quote) "User was frustrated that info on CC was never shared. She heard 'you can look it up' but wasn't instructed how. Wishes VHA had emailed her to tell her about CC with a link to this. When she went to the VA she says nobody gave her a list of providers or explained how to find out."

>  P8 (AQ) "just glad to know this website is here". Would use this (instead of Google) because of the knowledge about VA. Will share with friends in her care group where she learned about previous Community Care benefits"

> "Notifications would be good. Individuals like myself that have emails. Alot of websites have notifications about whatever marketing scheme they're running so why wouldn't it be good for the VA to notify Veterans about this website and how it can assist me and others?"

##### Participants generally understood "Urgent care benefit information" is something they should click.

> "When I see something like that, I would like to click on it to see if it's something I need to know before even thinking about going there". 

However, some Veterans apply previous understanding of benefits to new programs and sometimes make assumptions. Most confused the Community urgent care benefit with other programs. Even after clicking through the link users may remain skeptical.

> "before you go, you have to call this number and we have to authorize that you're even allowed to go in for your sprained ankle." 

This particular user was on the Community urgent care information page for **two full minutes refusing to read** the information saying, 

>"To me, it's another one of those VA blah, blah, blah screens that's all words that's not going to get me any answers and it's going to steer me rrrright back to the home page. To me, there's a lot of these pages that are just fluff and get me no place." 

**3. Facilities with statuses stating "Limited services and hours” were interpreted as being less available or having fewer services than those with “Call for services and hours”..**<br> A yellow warning style status was used for both facility types. However, when users compared the two, "Call for services and hours" that was used on Community urgent care facilities, was interpreted as less limiting and more of an invitation to call. 

> "I would trust the VA knowing it's a bigger place. The hardest part when you click to the VA is it says "Limited services and hours". That might deter me from going there because maybe they are an 8-5.. The one up above "Call for services and hours" with COVID makes perfect sense".

**4. Veterans use "in network", "outside" and "civilian" to describe VA and non-VA options.**<br> Throughout the studies 5 participants used the term in network to describe facility options that would be covered by insurance. Three participants used the word "outside" and two used the word "civilian" to describe non-VA facilities or providers.

> "Means that you can go to a civilian provider that the VA would pay for"

**5. Veterans don't believe it's up to them to decide where to go for urgent care.**<br>
Veterans understand that they occasionally get "sent" to non-VA providers in certain circumstances but it is not something that they think they can choose on their own.

> "I didn't realize, I thought you had to get sent to these, most of the outside providers. I hadn't heard of these urgent providers in-network, like you just walk in. That's something new to me. Usually I call the VA. Normally, they'd send me somewhere if they couldn't see me in a reasonable amount of time. They would send an authorization. They have an office and they would call me and tell me which doctor to go to and it would all be taken care of... I wouldn't just choose something on my own because I'm not familiar with that at all within the VA healthcare system."

**• ½ of all participants filtered urgent care options by "VA health".**<br>
These same users lacked awareness of the Community urgent care benefit. By the end of each session, these participants felt that the new understanding of the additional options could impact their ultimate choice. Most said that they would still call to verify.

**7. Close proximity is a crucial factor when choosing urgent care.**<br>
Long travel and wait times compound existing factors that Veterans face such economic hardships and managing symptoms of cognitive disabilities under stressful situations.

> "I'm probably going to start using option A [community urgent care] regardless, because I don't drive. I use public transportation. It saves money. And I catch the bus probably 10 miles across town to get to my VA when there's a doctor's office, a 1/4 of a mile away. That's better for me."

A caretaker explaining a past experience with her Veteran husband,

>  "if he's having a bad day because fireworks go off the night before, he's agitated and his anxiety is high, taking him to the VA knowing he'll sit there for 6 hours, like issues we've had in the past, it's better to skip that anxiety and escalation, and pay out of pocket"

**8. Lack of visual affordances impact how users perceive page data and functionality.**<br>
Half of users only noticed the first two listings and most didn't scroll to see more. Those that did try scrolling, would try to scroll the page level scrollbars to see more which don't affect the list of results. These users were on modern browsers where system scrollbars were comprised of very thin graphics that only appeared on hover.  Those with browsers that displayed thicker looking scrollbars, that stayed on screen, scrolled the list on their own without being prompted. 
> "Oh, ok, I see you gotta drag the little line between the map and the other thing"..."If this is a prototype, there should be some arrows or something" "I tried to move [scroll] the entire screen..."

Another user didn't see the search functionality until being prompted to scroll down the page because it was below the paragraphs of text and looked like the end of the page.

**9. Veterans did not seek out labels like "Retail" or "VA health" to identify the facility type.**<br>
Participants did, however, want a label or designation to know if a non-VA location was "military cultured" which for this caretaker meant, 
> "providers that have training and understanding of Veteran's mental health needs, i.e. how a patient with PTSD's needs under a stressful sprained ankle situation".  
Another caretaker echoed similar needs that some Veterans have, 
> "If they have an outburt, where the VA will understand that they happen. The VA handles it a lot easier. They [non VA] would want to tie him up and stuff so he doesn't hurt himself. The VA doesn't do that stuff."

**10. Two Veterans specifically asked for wait times to be surfaced in search results.**

> "What would be nice is if you had current wait times, is it 15 min, 30 min, an hour... Our hospital here posts their wait times on their FaceBook page. If I have two places and one has a 15 min wait and one has an hour wait, I'm going to the one with the 15 min wait. I don't want to wait an hour to see a doctor."

> "Yeah, because I know with some VAs you can call and try to get an appt. It might take you a month to get one. Whereas with this other urgent care, it might not take that long, so it's possible that you could get an appt that same day."

## Additional Insights

1.  Calling is the easiest way for Veterans to navigate their healthcare. By the end of each session, most participants expressed that they would still likely call the VA to clarify benefit uncertainty or to verify hours and services. 

2.  Veterans like clicking links that directly take them to directions or to make a call, especially when on a mobile device.

3.  Veterans may not distinguish between urgent and emergency care. When asked about past or theoretical urgent care experiences and situations, participants would often describe emergency room visits or emergency situations as they thought through what they did in the past or what they might do in the future.

4.  Veterans have favorable opinions of "The Nurseline".

5.  One Veteran asked if there was a place to submit feedback to the VA on the website. When directed to the feedback button on the Facility Locator page, the participant was disappointed in seeing a star rating as his only option. He expected a freeform field where he would be able to type in his feedback.

## Recommendations

1.  Since Veterans do not currently know of Community urgent care benefits, remove the "VA health" preselection under "Choose a VA facility type". This would allow Veterans to see "Urgent care" as an option instead of influencing the more likely path of "VA health" / "Urgent care" which limits the total choices available to them.

2.  Do not style "Call for services and hours" as a status - use a more subtle treatment. 

3.  Proceed with the linkable info status styling to communicate Community urgent care benefits information.

4.  Use language that mirrors how Veterans understand and communicate benefit and facility terminology and highlight "what's in it for them".

 - On Community care listings, use words that Veterans use like 'in-network' to communicate that a location will be covered by insurance.

 - On the Community Care urgent care information page, lead with the benefit that is new or differentiate how it differs from other programs with a similar name. Eg, "Urgent Care Closer to Home" or "More Urgent Care Options". Add a timestamp or explanation, "As of..you can now.." to make clear that this is different from previous programs.

5. Add more visual affordances to page functionality. 

 - Reduce the amount of copy the precedes search functionality on the "Find VA Locations" to allow the gray box to appear "above the fold" at high zoom levels. 

 - Add the number of listings to the results line of text that appears above the listings and map. Move "Can't find what you're looking for?.." to a less prominent location and to give the results copy line the proper hierarchy.

 - Use consistent typographic styling for results between VA and non-VA location listings so that important differences appear more salient. 

 - An area to watch or study further: Since the results list relies on system scrollbars, consider forcing wider or persistent scrollbars or a secondary way of moving results listing up and down, e.g. arrows.
