# Research Plan for Urgent Care Mashup - July 2020

## Goals
The goal of this study is to validate the usability and design of new facility locator search result cards which combine VA urgent care and community urgent care service types.

#### Research questions
- What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking urgent care?
â€“ What information do Veterans need/want for community urgent care (in VA network) locations?
- Do Veterans need to distinguish between these location types in a single list?
- Do Veterans know about the community care urgent care benefit?
- How should the community care urgent care benefit be presented? 
- Are labels necessary? 

#### Hypothesis 
- Veterans don't know that they can get urgent care in their community outside of a VA urgent care facility.
- Veterans don't need to know what kind of facility they are choosing (VA vs community urgent care).
- Veterans don't know that they should present an Urgent Care Assistance Card when visiting a community urgent care provider. 

## Method

Remote, moderated usability testing will be used to gain feedback on facility locator results designs. The tests will guage participants' understanding of all urgent care facility options available to them and how they would go about claiming community urgent care benefits.

We will be testing a [UXPin prototype] via Zoom. These sessions will include a short interview with the participant.

## Participants and recruitment

We will utilize the Perigean contract to reach our goal of observing **10** participants.

Participant Criteria:

- All genders
- A mix of rural and urban
- Veterans & Caregivers
