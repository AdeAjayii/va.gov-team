# Research Plan for Urgent Care Mashup Study 

**July 2020 Discovery**<br>

## Goals
The goal of this study is to validate the usability and design of new facility locator search result cards which combine VA urgent care and community urgent care service types.

#### Research questions
- What information do Veterans need/want from the Facility Locator search results when seeking urgent care?
â€“ What information do Veterans need/want for community urgent care (in VA network) locations?
- Do Veterans need to distinguish between these location types in a single list?
- Do Veterans know about the community care urgent care benefit?
- How should the community care urgent care benefit be presented? 
- Are labels indicating urgent care service/facility type necessary when a Veteran chooses an urgent care location? 

#### Hypothesis 
- Veterans will understand that they can get urgent care in their community outside of a VA urgent care facility.
- Veterans don't need or want to know what kind of facility they are choosing (VA vs community urgent care).
- Veterans will understand that they should present an Urgent Care Assistance Card when visiting a community urgent care provider. 

## Method

Remote, moderated usability testing will be used to gain feedback on the design of facility locator search result that will combine cards for VA urgent care and community urgent care. The study will validate that the new designs will allow:
 - participants to understand all of the urgent care facility options available to them.
 - validate that the new design would suggiciently inform them about community urgent care benefits.

We will be testing a [UXPin prototype] via Zoom. These sessions will include a short interview with the participant.
