## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding urgent care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** 
- **First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started.**
- **Then, I'll be share a link to a prototype and ask you to share your screen.** We'll look at a protoype together and I will ask you questions about it.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you, instead we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

- Can you tell me a little about your service history?
- Have you ever needed or looked for Urgent care (VA or non-VA)?
    - If yes, can you tell me about that?


## Usability Test - 25 minutes

I'm going to share a link to a prototype and ask that you to share your screen.

###### MODERATOR SHARES LINK TO PROTOTYPE
[UXPin Link]

 Since this is only a prototype some links and features will work but most won't. I ask that you think out loud as we go through the prototype.

###### Prototype: VA.gov main
#### Question:
- Are you familiar with VA.gov's location finder? 

###### Prototype: User clicks on 'Find a VA Location'
#### Questions:
- Have you had a reason to use it recently? 
    - If yes, what were you doing? What was that experience like?
    - If no, how do you go about finding information about VA locations?
- Have you ever needed or looked for Urgent care on this website?

### Scenario

I'm going to walk us through a scenario: You are coming to the site because you need to visit an Urgent Care location. You have a sore throat and you'd like to rule out strep throat. You live in Denver, CO.

### Task
#### Questions:
- Talk me through how would you go about finding Urgent care on this page?
- Can you try to do that? Again, this is only a prototype so some things might not work as expected.

###### Prototype Page: User performs search
- Talk me through what you see on this page?
- What can you tell me about the location options?
- How would you go about choosing a location on this screen?
- Are the types of location options available all the same or are they different?

###### (Prototype Page: User points out status and info link)
- What does the [status] mean to you?  
- What does "[link on card verbiage]" mean to you? What do you think you will find when you click it?
- What would be your next step?

###### Prototype Page: User clicks on info link (community care/ urgent care)
- Talk me through what you see on this page?
- What is this page trying to communicate to you?
- What can you tell me about urgent care benefits?
- What would be your next step?

###### Prototype Page: User goes back to search results page

Let's imagine now that you called and confirmed that all of the locations are open and can treat your sore throat. 
- How would you go about choosing a location on this screen?
- What can you tell me about urgent care benefits as they relate to the urgent care location options available to you?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Are there any urgent care websites that you have used in the past? what was that experience like?
- Is there anything that I haven't asked you that you think that I should know?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
