## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding healthcare on the VA.gov website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** 
- **First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started.**
- **Then, I'll be sharing a link to a prototype and ask you to share your screen.** We'll look at a protoype together and I will ask you questions about it.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you, instead we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

- Can you tell me a little about your service history?
- Have you visited the VA for healthcare in the past year?
    - If yes, can you tell me about that?


## Usability Test - 25 minutes

I'm going to share a link to a prototype and ask that you to share your screen.

###### MODERATOR SHARES LINK TO PROTOTYPE

Since this is only a prototype some links and features will work but most won't. I ask that you think out loud as we go through the prototype.

###### PROTOTYPE: VA.gov main
#### Question:
- Are you familiar with VA.gov's location finder? 
Go ahead and click 'Find a VA location' for me.

###### PROTOTYPE: User clicks on 'Find a VA Location'
#### Questions:
- Have you ever used this page? 
    - If yes, how long ago, what were you doing? What was that experience like?
    - If no, how do you go about finding information about VA locations?

### Scenario
#### Directions:
I'm going to walk us through a scenario and have you perform a couple tasks. Again, this is only a prototype so some things might not work as expected. As you work through the tasks I'd like you to think out loud and narrate what you see and what goes through your mind.


I'd like you to imagine that you are coming to this site because you think you might have sprained your ankle. You don't want to go to an emergency room because you don't think it's quite that serious. You live in Denver, CO.

### Task 1
#### Questions:

###### PROTOTYPE: User performs search

For your first task I'd like you to:

- Talk me through how you would go about finding care on this page.
    - Go ahead and try that now? 
    
I see you've selected [] 
- Can talk me through why you chose those particular options?
- What would be your next step?

[click 'search button']

###### PROTOTYPE: Search results
- Talk me through what you see on this page?
- What is your thought process for choosing an urgent care location in this scenario? 
- What is important to you when choosing from this list?

### Task 2

I'm going to have you do a second task. For this task, under the 'Choose a VA facility type' menu, I'd like you to choose 'Urgent care'.

#### Questions:

- Talk me through what the different options mean to you in the 'Choose a service type' menu?
   - What does 'Community urgent care providers (in VA's network)' mean to you?
   - What does 'VA urgent care' mean to you? 
- Does this distinction matter to you? 
   - What matters about the distinction?

### Scenario
In this next scenario, I'd like you to imagine that you are considering the two closest locations. 
Go ahead and click the blue 'Search' button for me.

#### Questions:
- What would be important to you in comparing these two options.
- If you chose A, how would you prepare to visit this location?
    - What does "[link on card verbiage]" mean to you? What do you think you will find when you click it?
        - [user clicks community care page]
    - Briefly, what is this page trying to communicate?
    
Let's go back to the search results page. As you're comparing,

- If you chose B, how would you prepare to visit this location?
    - What does the [status] mean to you?  
- What would be your next step?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

I have just a couple more questions before we finish up:

- Have you ever visited an urgent care clinic in the past (VA or non-VA)?
    - If yes, can you tell me about that?
- Can you think of anything that would make this website easier for you to use next time?
- Is there anything that I haven't asked you that you think that I should know?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
