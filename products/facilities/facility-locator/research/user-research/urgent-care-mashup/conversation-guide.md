## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding urgent care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** 
- **First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started.
- **Then, I'll be sharing my screen.** We'll look at a protoype together and I will ask you questions about it.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you, instead we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

- Can you tell me a little about your service history?
- Have you ever used the VA for urgent care?


## First Task: [REVIEW LOCATION FINDER] - 5 minutes

For our first exercise, I'd like for us to look at VA.gov website together, so that I can point out the area that we'll be talking about. I have a few questions before we begin.

I'm going to walk us through a scenario:

You are coming to the site because you need to visit an Urgent Care location in Denver, CO. You enter the location and click the search button and you come to this page.

- What can you tell me about the location options?
- How would you go about choosing a location on this screen?
- What information do you need to make a selection?
- What would be your next step?
- What does "link verbiage" mean to you? What do you think you will find when you click it?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
