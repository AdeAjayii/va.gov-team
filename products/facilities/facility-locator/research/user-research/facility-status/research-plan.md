# Research Plan for Facility Operating Status - June 2020

## Goals
There is no standard way to define the current facility operating statuses provided on the Facility Locator. This leads to inconsistencies when relaying information to Veterans.

#### Research questions
- What terminology is helpful for Veterans to understand a facility's operating status?
- What events impact a facility's status?
- How do Veterans understand the current messaging/categorization of statuses?
- How do Veterans categorize various events that affect a facility's operating status?
- How might we create consistent messaging to Veterans across VA (VHA, Vet Centers, etc.)?

#### Hypothesis 
- Veterans will not understand what service/access they can receive through the current status messaging
- Veterans want a clear understanding of a facility's operating status
- Veterans will only want to know when a facility's normal operation is impacted, regardless of facility type
- Veterans want to know what service/access they can receive upon viewing a facility's operating status

## Method
TBD
