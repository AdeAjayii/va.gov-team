# Research Plan for Facility Operating Status - June 2020

## Goals
There is no standard way to define the current facility operating statuses provided on the Facility Locator. This leads to inconsistencies when relaying information to Veterans.

#### Research questions:
- What terminology is helpful for Veterans to understand a facility's operating status?
- What events impact a facility's status?
- How do Veterans understand the current messaging/categorization of statuses?
- How do Veterans categorize various events that affect a facility's operating status?
