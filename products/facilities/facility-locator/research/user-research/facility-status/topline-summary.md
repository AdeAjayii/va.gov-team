This topline summary is a result of the synthesis that happens after conducting/observing research sessions. This is a high level summary of trends and analysis, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data


## Introduction
----------------

In general, participants categorized events and information that affect the status of a facility into two main categories; information that lets them prepare for their visit in advance and information that needs to be communicated more expeditiously. The delivery mechanism was also implied in the way users categorized, expecting to be informed about the more urgent information. 

Information that was more temporary in nature would expire and be noted with timeframes.

More findings will follow this topline summary upon deeper synthesis  of the research.

## Research Questions & Answers
--------------------------------

**How do people currently get information on facility operating hours/status?**

 - Most participants had used the facility locator tool but only on a couple of occasions explaining that they only used it initially to find their VA location or when travelling or moving. 

 - Many participants mentioned calling the phone number for more information but some expressed frustration in having to call multiple times to get through, unanswered messages, and long wait times, exacerbating the need for accurate information on the website.

 - Some participants expressed bypassing the facility locator altogether, using Google to get to the facility's website directly. 

**How do Veterans understand the current messaging/categorization of statuses?**

 - When shown in isolation of other statuses or messaging, all participants understood "Facility Closed" to mean that the physical building was closed and no services, neither in person nor virtual, would be available to them. Some participants interpreted the status to mean the facility is permanently closed.

 - When shown in isolation of other statuses or messaging, "Facility Notice" had the broadest interpretation, covering any information useful to a participant regarding a visit, like wearing a mask or a change in regular hours and services.

 - When shown in isolation of other statuses or messaging, participants understood "Limited Services" to mean that not all doctors nor services would be available, hours may be shortened and perhaps only emergency services would be available.

 - "Limited Services" was the most consistently interpreted status for any deviation from normal operating hours and services. However, it was extremely important for participants to extrapolate from the website which services would be available to them. 

**How do Veterans categorize various events that affect a facility's operating status?**

 - When given a COVID 19 scenario, (where a facility is only offering virtual services) and the option to assign from the three current statuses, 62.5% participants chose "Limited Services", 37.5% chose "Facility Notice", and 0% participants chose "Facility Closed".

 - Some participants created a unique category for weather related conditions that affect a facility's operating status, using words like weather or emergency to name or define the category.

**How might we create consistent messaging to Veterans across VA (VHA, Vet Centers, etc.)?**

 - All participants were influenced by how COVID has changed the nature of their healthcare and understood that most facilities would be operating under somewhat limited conditions, therefore "Facility Closed" should be used sparingly, as many participants assume that they will not be able to conduct any degree of healthcare at that facility and will 'move on to the next facility' in their search.

## Hypotheses & Answers
------------------------

**Veterans will not understand what service/access they can receive through the current status messaging**

True.

 - The use of a 'Facility Closed' in cases where virtual services could still be accessed, would cause users to bypass the facility altogether and seek out an open facility as they would assume their service is completely unavailable. 

**Veterans want a clear understanding of a facility's operating status**

True.

 - Generally, users did not want information "buried" in many clicks and expected accurate hours and services information surfaced at the search results screen. Participants made suggestions like, 'hover over icon for more information', 'add a bullet', and 'add a drop down' to get specific explanations about each status.

**Veterans will only want to know when a facility's normal operation is impacted, regardless of facility type**

True.

 - However, participants expect and/or desire to be notified of changes that would impact them. They would not think to seek this information out on their own. They assume someone will call them or a text will alert them of a change.

**Veterans want to know what service/access they can receive upon viewing a facility's operating status**

True.

 - Participants expressed trusting the information on the website and expect to see an accurate account of the services that would be available to them. This is very important for them to be able to plan their visit or choose a VA location. 

## Other Findings
------------------

**Colors, symbols and location impact the participants ability to correctly interpret a status.** 

 - Participants pointed out that the bolder red used on the facility detail page stood out more to them versus the subtle pink used in the results screen

> "if the facility is truly closed, make it red. You know how it's pink? Make it RED. That's a STOP"

> "That color blends into the map for me."

**Time sensitive information needs to be communicated to the user.**

 - Most of the participants mentioned getting notifications via text, a call or email to communicate time sensitive information that would impact their visit.

> "Maybe if you have an appointment that day, a text is sent to your phone? To give you the status of the facility. For example, say, you have an appointment and mask are required, they can send a quick text, maybe the day before your appointment, so you know to take your mask with you."

> "I enjoy now getting text notifications from different companies and service sites that I utilize. To me, it lessens the amounts of notifications..."

**Users understand 'virtual services' and 'telehealth' can be used interchangeably.**

 - With the recent changes in healthcare delivery, due to Covid 19, users understand services may be delivered in new ways, but they expect to find clear details about what services will be available and in which manner.

> "My doctor was offering Telehealth, but how do you do labs? Why would I want to just talk to you if I still have to come in to do labs?"

> "If there is a list of services, it would say, these are the services and we can do through Telehealth. I guess it could just be a dropdown from limited services with a list."

**Timestamps deepen a user's trust that the information presented on a website is accurate.**  

 - When information is of a temporary nature, specify a time range.

 - When there are changes to normal operating conditions, users like seeing an explicit date of when the website was last updated/reviewed.

> "Oh, it hasn't been updated in a year so it might not be as accurate vs. being updated yesterday so it should be accurate."

> "Missing the year would make me wonder if this is an old notice. If you see it in that manner I do not know if this is new or old, not having the year associated would make me question it."
