# Notetaking template for Moderated Card Sort - Facility Locator, Operating Status

**June 2020 Discovery**<br>


## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Shawna and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA.gov website and the information you see on those location pages. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** 
- **First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started.
- **Then, I'll ask you to share your screen.** This will allow us to follow along with you. I'll send you a link and we'll look at the location finder together and I'll ask you a few questions about it.
- **You'll be participating in four exercises.** I will send you a link to a different website for that. 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you, instead we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

[Start recording]

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

**Moderator:** Can you tell me a little about your service history?

I haven't been in the military, I"m the spouse of a retired veteran.

Are you his caregiver?

Yes

**Moderator:** Have you visited a VA location recently? 

I haven't visited it on my own. He gets into the sites, I help him sometimes if he doesn't understand what he's doing. 

**Moderator:** So mostly he does it himself, but you just help?

Yes exactly

**Moderator:** What reasons do you visit VA locations?

For medications, I am looking for different things for me - I'm in college so I'm looking for things or benefits for me.

**Moderator:** Oh, interesting


## First Task: [REVIEW LOCATION FINDER] - 15 minutes



**Moderator:** I'd like us to look at the website together, so that I can point out the area that we'll be talking about. I'm going to share a link and ask you to share your screen so that I can follow along.

(Struggling to share screen - moderator updates settings. Participant can't share - Moderator shares own screen and will talk through things)

[QUESTIONS]

**Moderator:** Are you familiar with VA.gov's location finder?

I've seen that on his stuff, yes. 
 
**Moderator:** Have you had a reason to use it recently? 

Yes, when we look for different facilities wherever we have travelled or whatever.

**Moderator:** Can you remember a specific instance?

We have a cabin about 3 hours from our home, we've looked up facilites to see if there is one close by. We're up in state college right now. 

**Moderator:** Got it.  How did you get information about location hours and covid stuff?

That's why we're at the cabin, we don't have anybody around us. 

**Moderator:** So you would typically just call?

MMhmm. 

**Moderator:** I'm going to do a little search now, let's pretend the cabin is near this zip code. You did this search and you saw this stuff on the left here.  What do you think is going on here?

That there, the government closed a facility or something because of COVID. I would find the next closest facility.

**Moderator:** How trustworthy would you feel like that was?

Um. Because the first facility was closed, I would call the next one to see if it was open.

**Moderator:** So you would just trust that this one is closed and you'd move to the next one?

Yep.

**Moderator:** Got it. 

##Second Task: [DEFINE CURRENT STATUSES] - 5 minutes

**Moderator:** We're going to move onto the next exercise. So, I'm going to share a link for you to click on.  

I would say the facility is closed, they weren't open at all. They are closed for a specific reason, they didn't list it. I would move on to another facility.

**Moderator:** What about this one? (Faciity Notice) What are you thinking?

I would think something is going on and they're figuring it out with a date to be determined and I'd call to see if we're still able to go.

**Moderator:** So to you, it wouldn't necessarily mean that things are closed....

That something might be going on there and they haven't disclosed what it is yet. For example, our drug store was just closed downtown due to an employee coming in that had COVID and they had to close down to disinfect. 

**Moderator:** So you might think, this could mean that it was closed but you weren't sure so you would call. What about this one? (Limited services)

That they were only open to emergency services.

**Moderator:** What would you do?

I would call and find out what the limited service is for.

**Moderator:** Do you mean why? or what services they offer?

What services they offer.

**Moderator:** Do you care about why these things might be occuring?

It doesn't matter to me. They have their specific reasons. To me... it affects me but then it doesn't affect me.  They have reasons for it.

**Moderator:** What do you mean... what doesn't matter?

They have their reasons for it. I can't change their mind for it regardless.

**Moderator:** Got it. Yeah. Great. Okay, so let's look at this potential scenario "The evanston clinic...."


## Third Task: [MULTIPLE CHOICE - CHOOSE A STATUS]  - 5 minutes
 
[Multiple choice activity]

**Moderator:** Now, i'd like you to read over this blurb and choose which status you think it should have.

Give me a second to re-read it.

**Moderator:** If none of these things fit...

I'd say the telehealth is limited services... they're still able to help you. That's what I Think it would be.

**Moderator:** Okay perfect. 

## Fourth Task: [CARD SORT 2 - OPEN SORT OF SCENARIOS] - 10 minutes

[Card Sort]

**Moderator:** Now we're going to look at a number of different scenarios that can impact a VA facility's hours and services. I'd like you to review them and sort them in categories that makes the most sense to you. You can create and name the categories in whatever way makes the most sense to you. Given what's important for you to know when visiting VA locations, how would you sort and categorize these scenarios?

(Participant will direct moderator since screensharing didn't work. Participant is looking over cards)

P: The flu season... can you make that another column?

**Moderator:**  Yep.

P: The mask in the second one... The traffic one in another one. No that's right. The president one in the third.  The doctor, where your hand is now, can you make that a fourth column. The bad weather one, column four. The construction one in the third. The facility is open to employees - make that in the fifth one, no actually the first one. Yeah. The facility is open in the first one. The facility is closed - put that on in the first on. The chemical spill on in the fourth one. The active shooter I'd say in the fourth.  The holiday one in the first.

**Moderator:** Okay, so what are these categories to you?

The first one is re-scheduling appointments and telehealth. The second one is Wear mask, no extra people due to people being sick.  The fourth one is parking... err not the fourth one the third one is for parking and traffic patterns.  And the fifth (fourth) one is also... I guess that could part of the first one. 

**Moderator:** Do you want to re-think these two categories?

I'd say all them can go into the first one. That's how I would see them.

**Moderator:** So for the scheduling and telehealth... if you looked up the location on the finder...

What I've been seeing with the vets and the doctors, that's basically what they're doing is the telehealth and you have to wear a mask and don't bring anybody else with you.

**Moderator:** Should we put a second one or should we put a new one?  So this is more like giving specific instructions.

I guess this should be on it's own.   Maybe we could re-word that one (second one). I guess it could be Rules. or Instructional.

**Moderator:** Got it, that makes sense.  Do you want to move any of these other ones? Or are these all right at this point?

The facility is closed... Nah I think they're good. 

**Moderator:** Okay! Now let's take your categories and think about what we were looking at before... Let's go back to search.  So we looked at the facility closed, and the other three as well.  Do you feel like... What do you feel like the three that you looked at before vs the categories that you just made?

I think they fit in there pretty well... I think they follow suit with what's being said.

**Moderator:** Do you feel like... they're more or less useful than the other three that we looked at?

I think it helps describe the possibilities of what's going on.

**Moderator:** Got it. Is that useful to you?

MMhmm. mmhmm.

**Moderator:** Umm, alright. Let me check if I have any last questions. I'll stop sharing my screen. I just have one last question. Has there ever been a time when you've been to a facility and they've had different operating hours?

No.

**Moderator:** Has there ever been a time that you've used the facility locator tool and had issues with it?

No.  He was hospitalized and I thought I couldn't get in at a certain time... but I was wrong. There was a part of the hospital that we couldnt' get into. The hospital he generally uses... the way I get in to see him... I didn't know it was open during the day.  

**Moderator:** So that would have been useful to know?

I thought I wouldn't be able to see him on a sunday, but I could. I thought it was closed.  I just thought it was closed because the clinic was closed.

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Any questions for me? 

No. I hope I was helpful.

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

Bye
