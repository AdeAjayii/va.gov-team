# Notetaking template for Moderated Card Sort - Facility Locator, Operating Status

**June 2020 Discovery**<br>


## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA.gov website and the information you see on those location pages. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** 
- **First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started.
- **Then, I'll ask you to share your screen.** This will allow us to follow along with you. I'll send you a link and we'll look at the location finder together and I'll ask you a few questions about it.
- **You'll be participating in four exercises.** I will send you a link to a different website for that. 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you, instead we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

[Start recording]

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

**Moderator:** Can you tell me a little about your service history?

I was in the US army from 2008 - 2011. Deployed to Afganistan in 2010. I was homoraly discharged... considered medically discharged now.

**Moderator:** Have you visited a VA location recently? 

Not since the pandemic, no ma'am... before the pandemic I was going to see my mental health provider... he was a very thorough doctor. I go for neurology, physical therapy every once in awhile. Cardiology... I'm at a loss for words.

Why is my brain shutting down on me... that's the reason I go.

**Moderator:** What reasons do you visit VA locations?


## First Task: [REVIEW LOCATION FINDER] - 15 minutes

I'd like us to look at the website together, so that I can point out the area that we'll be talking about. I'm going to share a link and ask you to share your screen so that I can follow along.

[QUESTIONS]

**Moderator:** Are you familiar with VA.gov's location finder?

When my wife and I first started going to the VA back in 2012, we just kind of Googled where they were... kind of got lost a couple times.

**Moderator:** How are you currently getting information on location hours, closures, etc.?

I call and hope I get through to somebody
 

[MODERATOR SHARES SCREEN & PULLS UP LOCATION FINDER]
https://www.va.gov/find-locations/ 

**Moderator:** I'm going to walk us through a scenario. Imagine you are planning a trip and you’d like to know what the closest VA facility would be from where you’ll be staying.

**Moderator:** If you were in this situation, what information would you need when preparing to visit to a facility?

So my wife and I are actually going to be moving to [Redacted State] and I would be using this... I would type in the city and... and I see it shows where you can choose a facility type so would it be a hospital? 

**Moderator:** What information would be useful?

How far away is it going to be from where I'm moving? What type of services do they offer? What I need to do to switch over, stuff like that

**Moderator:** What can you tell me about the hours and services at the location?
**Moderator:** What would be your next step?

The facility is closed. So since it's a suite I would assume that they don't have a lot of services... the hours I don't see, it just says it's closed. Can I interact with this? I would want to figure out when they are open if I could call and see what services they would offer. 

## Second Task: [DEFINE CURRENT STATUSES]  - 5 minutes

We're going to move onto the second exercise.

[PULLS UP OPTIMAL SORT]

**Moderator:** Today, when a location is not operating with normal hours and services, we display 1 of 3 possible statuses. On the following screens, we’re going to look at these statuses and I’d like you to tell me how you interpret each of them.

    - Facility Closed
    - Facility notice 
    - Limited services

    
**Facility closed**
That they are closed... I won't be able to get in contact with anybody if I try calling anyone. I wouldn't say permanently... it just says... right now I would assume that they're closed because of the COVID-19 stuff going on. 

I would probably wait until the next day to see if it opens back up... unless there was something else specifically saying that they are closed for good.

**Facility notice**
There may have been some changes to the hours and services so I need to look at their website. Again, with what's going on right now I'd probably call ahead before I went to an appointment there to see if I need to take any extra precautions like wear a mask. 

**Limited service**
speaks for itself, they are only oferring certain services like maybe they are oferring mental health appointments over the phone but not doing anything in the office... but if they are doing things in the office they may not be oferring everything. Maybe not physical therpay because of close contact.

**Moderator:** How do you think about the difference between these three?

The first one I'd probbaly add more to it, like a bullet underneath, like if they are closed for the duration and you could still contact them or permanently closed... or they switched locations. It would be good to make them seperate (permanently closed versus not) 


## Third Task: [MULTIPLE CHOICE - CHOOSE A STATUS]  - 5 minutes
 
[MULTIPLE CHOICE ACTIVITY]

**Moderator:**  On this third exercise, I'd like you to read over the blurb of text and choose which status you think it should have.

limited services, because they are not closed. You are still able to use... talk to your doctors. I do, I talk to my mental health provider every month still. So I'm still being provided services by the VA and meeting my appontments.

I guess it could fit under facility notice. an email or mass text to send everyone...   

**Moderator:** What are your thoughts overall about these three statuses for labels on facilities (Facility closed, Facility notice, Limited services)? Do you feel like they are distinct and make sense? Are any parts confusing? What do you like about them?

Now that you and I have talked about it, no... if I were to kind of glance at it, if I was another person who hadn't taken part in a survey or really questioned what it meant, maybe [it would be confusing]... The facility closed, not sure if I can still contact my doctors kind of thing... everything else is pretty obvious I guess.

## Fourth Task: [CARD SORT 2 - OPEN SORT OF SCENARIOS] - 10 minutes

[CARD SORT PREP]

**Moderator:**  This is the 4th and final exercise.

We just went over three possibilities for statuses that you could see on a facility, "Facility closed," "Facility notice," and "Limited services."  

you mentioned those labels were confusing in **x ways** previously so we think you might have a different idea about how you might name them.

The white boxes contain various events that could affect facility hours and services and currently could result in seeing statuses like the ones we saw earlier. I’d like you to consider each event and sort them into categories. I’ll move them for you.

Afterwards you can create "statuses" that make sense to you. You could use the statuses we’ve already seen or create new statuses.

[CARD SORT]

**Feel free to think out loud as you work through the exercise.**

I'm trying to base it off the 3... 

He's struggling with putting things in the 3 categories... he's trying to stick to the 3 but not having an easy time of it... 

how do people know whether or not they should show up?



[AFTER CARD SORT]

[QUESTION]

**Moderator:**  Ok, looking at theses categories, do you feel like they work for you?

**Moderator:**  Can you talk me through how these categories might work as more useful statuses on the VA locations pages? You can rename them if you like. 

**Moderator:**  Can you take a look at these specific cards and double check that the categories you've made are correct for them? If not feel free to make new categories or move things. 
   - "The facility is open"

 Since the facility is open still, they can still go in. It doens't say that it's closed... it just says they are urged to reshedule... 
 
 If it's closed to patients... employees can still go in and do what they do... 
 
 If they are still oferring services, just not all their services, than the services are limited in what they are doing... (so virtual services mean that the facility is not completely closed).
 
The president one, I wasn't sure if it was closed or not... are they wanting people to call and reschedule? I feel like there was a couple that could have been both... like notice and closed... because you need to let people know... the other two closed are good where they are at. You could probably put the social unrest one over there on the right as well.

Some things I would hope they would call me... what if I don't get on the website between now and then

They could be like two things... facility open to patients but urged to reschedule that could be both notice and limited services

Instead of just limited service, say what's limited about it... and say what the notice is in the bullet instead of just having to go in and look at what the notice is or whatever. For all of them, including facility closed.
   
**Moderator:**  How do you think these categories you made compare to the three statuses we looked at before? (Facility closed, Facility notice, limited services)?

**Moderator:**  You saw that in some of these cards, facilities were closed physcially but still oferring virtual services. What status would best fit that in your estimation?

[MODERATOR PULLS UP LOCATOR BRIEFLY TO REFRESH PARTICIPANT’S MEMORY]

(optional) [MODERATOR CLICKS INTO LOCATION ON LAMAR, CO]

**Moderator:**  What about now? What can you tell me about the hours and services at this location?
**Moderator:**  What would make you trust that the information on the listing/result is accurate?
**Moderator:**  Can you think of a time when the information on a facility was unhelpful or inaccurate and affected your visit?

Facility closed limited services... they are still doing virtual care, telehealth things like that... it says visit the website 

Over on the right, I don't know if those are updated hours or those are normal hourse... (he's confused that it says facility closed but then it still has hours open)

**Moderator:** Have you ever gone to 

Im sure you can tell I get confused pretty easily... when I walk into my VA there's a gentleman that can tell you how to access the website



## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

**Moderator:**  what's the most important things for you to know when looking at a facility with these notices  

If there's a reason I need to call ahead... if there is a walk in notice...

And how long am I going to have to wait or should I start looking elsewhere, maybe for a facility further away... 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
