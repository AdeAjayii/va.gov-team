### Background

Research plan for [#31626](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/31626)

#### Related Research

- [Previous user research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research) done for the [VA.gov resources and support page](https://www.va.gov/resources/) determined the current categorization of the available benefits information. The study used a [card sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-summary.md) (via [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/)) to determine how Veterans and other SMEs would categorize benefits information by intended audience, and by topic.
