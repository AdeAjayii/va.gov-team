# Research Plan - Non-Clinical Services Taxonomy

Research plan for [#31626](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/31626), and for non-clinical services taxonomy audit [#30839](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30839).

## Background

As part of the effort to align benefits and services across VAMC pages, we need to determine how Veterans expect services to be categorized. This study is seeking validation for existing services and their categories, as well as for potential new services identified in [previous services taxonomy audits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/services-taxonomy/taxonomy-research-2021).

### Related Research

- [Previous user research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research) done for the [VA.gov resources and support page](https://www.va.gov/resources/) determined the current categorization of the available benefits information. The study used a [card sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-summary.md) (via [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/)) to determine how Veterans and other SMEs would categorize benefits information by intended audience, and by topic.
    - The study used an unmoderated hybrid card sort, open to participants for 2 weeks
    - 39 Veterans, and 9 SME/content authors, for a total of 48 participants
    - The study compared participant categorization with hypothesized categories, and found they were mostly in alignment

## Research Goals

### Goals

This research has two main goals:
- To determine how Veterans would categorize the available services
- To determine how Veterans expect to find information about these services while navigating the VA.gov site

### Hypotheses



### Research Questions

1) **How would Veterans categorize the services currently found under "Social programs and services"?**
2) **Where do Veterans expect to find the following new services?**
    - Support groups
    - Workshops and classes
    - Veteran connections
3) **How do Veterans expect to find the following existing (non-clinical) services? (name and heading)**
