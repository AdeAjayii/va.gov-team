# Research Plan - Non-Clinical Services Taxonomy

Research plan for [#31626](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/31626), and for non-clinical services taxonomy audit [#30839](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30839).

## Background

As part of the effort to align benefits and services across VAMC pages, we need to determine how Veterans expect services to be categorized. This study is seeking validation for existing services and their categories, as well as for potential new services (rather tasks, as opposed to official VHA services) identified in [previous services taxonomy audits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/services-taxonomy/taxonomy-research-2021).

### Related Research

- [Previous user research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research) done for the [VA.gov resources and support page](https://www.va.gov/resources/) determined the current categorization of the available benefits information. The study used a [card sort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/tier-2-content-IA-and-design/learning-center-mvp/discovery-and-research/card-sort/card-sort-research-summary.md) (via [Optimal Workshop](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/)) to determine how Veterans and other SMEs would categorize benefits information by intended audience, and by topic.
    - The study used an unmoderated hybrid card sort, open to participants for 2 weeks
    - 39 Veterans, and 9 SME/content authors, for a total of 48 participants
    - The study compared participant categorization with hypothesized categories, and found they were mostly in alignment

## Research Goals

### Goals

Our two main goals are:
- To determine how Veterans would categorize existing and newly identified services
- To determine how Veterans expect to find information about these services while navigating VAMC pages

### Research Questions

1) Do the existing categories accurately reflect Veteran expectations of where to find services on VAMC pages?
2) Will Veterans create additional categories for existing services?
3) Will Veterans create additional categories for new services?
4) Are there services that are confusing, or need to be described using plainer language?
5) Do existing category names cause confusion, or do they need to described using plainer language?

### Hypotheses

- Veterans will associate most services with existing category headings.
- Veterans will create new categories for some of the existing services.
- Veterans will create new categories for some of the new services.
- Some of the existing, and new, services will cause confusion, and may require plainer language.

## Methodology

This study will utilize a moderated card sort and tree test, using [Optimal Workshop's](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/) UX research tools. The tree test allows us to see if Veterans want to create new service categories, and the card sort allows them to create those categories.

[!!! THIS TREE TEST MAY NEED TO BE REMOVED FOR THIS STUDY & CARD SORT EXPANDED]

- **TASK 1:** Participants will perform a tree test with new and existing services, with the currently existing category headings.
    <details>
    <summary>Tree test headings "tree"</summary>
    
        - Primary care
        - Mental health care
        - Specialty care
        - Social programs and services
        - Prepare for your visit
        - ("Another category not in this list")
    
    </details>

        - Telehealth
        - Veteran connections
        - Women veteran care
        - Workshops and classes

    </details>

- **TASK 2:** Participants will perform a hybrid card sort for a list of new and currently existing services. The categories will include existing health services headings ("Primary care", "Mental health care", etc.), new suggestions, as well as the option to add additional categories.

### Future research

- If participants create any new categories (headings) during the card sort, it could be beneficial to run another tree test that includes the newly defined categories.
