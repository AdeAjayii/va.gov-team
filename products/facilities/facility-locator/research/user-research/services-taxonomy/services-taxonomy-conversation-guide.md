## Intro [5 minutes]

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Nick, I'm a designer working on the VA.gov site, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today you are helping us simplify how Veterans find services on the VA.gov site. 

- **Do you have any questions before we get started?**

Before we get to the tasks you are helping us with today, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session is scheduled for 1 hour, but it may not take that long**.
- **There is no need to turn on your camera - if you perfer, audio only is fine**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. 
  - We are not testing you, or your ability, instead, we are finding out if the website meets your needs. 
  - You cannot do anything wrong. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
  - We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - [If yes]: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
  - [If no]: Alright, I will be writing or typing notes as we go.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

** **START RECORDING TO THE CLOUD** **

* **I have started recording.** 
  - I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"

## Warm-up [5 minutes]

- **Have you ever helped out a designer at the VA before, in any way?**
- **Today you're helping us out with one main task; it's called a *card sort*.**
  - Have you ever heard of these before, or done one in the past?
- **In order to help us out today, you will need to share your screen - are you comfortable doing that today?**
  - Before you do so, please make sure there is no personal information visible on your sreen, like email, Facebook, etc.
  - [Work out any technical difficulties - worst case, run tasks on my screen while explaining them]

## Usability tasks [~ 35 minutes]

### Task: card sort

- **First I'll explain how the card sort works**
  - On the left side of your screen, there is a list of services that are offered at VAMC facilities.
  - On the right side of your screen, are different ways to categorize those services.
  - You can drag items from the list of services on the left, into any category you choose, on the right.

***RUN CARD SORT***

## Closing [5 minutes]

### Post-research follow-up questions

[TBD]

### Thank you and closing

Thank you! Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Lastly, if you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session, our team can send you an email with a little description that you can pass along.

Thank you again, and enjoy the rest of your day.
