## Intro

Thank you for joining us today! My name is [TBD], I'm a designer working on the VA.gov site, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. 
Today you are helping us simplify how Veterans find services on the VA.gov site.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes**.
- **There is no need to turn on your camera - audio only is fine**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. 
  * We are not testing you, or your ability, instead, we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. 
  * You cannot do anything wrong. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

*START RECORDING TO THE CLOUD*

* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"

### Thank you and closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
