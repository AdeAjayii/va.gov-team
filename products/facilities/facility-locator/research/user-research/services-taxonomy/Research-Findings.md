# Research Goals

As part of the effort to align benefits and services across VAMC pages, we need to determine how Veterans expect services to be categorized. This study is seeking validation for existing services and their categories, as well as for potential new services (tasks, rather, as opposed to official VHA services) identified in [previous services taxonomy audits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/services-taxonomy/taxonomy-research-2021).

# Research Questions

1. Do the existing categories accurately reflect Veteran expectations of where to find services on VAMC pages?
2. Will Veterans create additional categories for existing services?
3. Will Veterans create additional categories for new services?
4. Are there services that are confusing, or need to be described using plainer language?
5. Do existing category names cause confusion, or do they need to described using plainer language?

# Methodology 

This study will utilize a moderated card sort, via [Optimal Workshop's](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/) UX research tools. The card sort allows participants to arrange services into the categories they think fit them best, or, to create new categories if the existing categories aren't a good fit.

- Participants will perform a hybrid card sort for a list of new and currently existing services. The categories will include existing health services headings ("Primary care", "Mental health care", etc.), new suggestions, as well as the option to add additional categories.

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

*("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”; “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”)*

1. Veterans will associate most services with existing category headings.
    - **Definitely true:** Some participants created new categories, but even they sorted the large majority of services into the predetermined categories. Most participants did not create new categories, and they sorted new and existing services into the predetermined categories.
2. Veterans will create new categories for some of the existing services.
    - **Likely true:** Some participants did create new categories for existing services, and gave their reasoning for why those categories were a better fit. There was alignment across participants related to why new categories were created - that said it is likely that more information is needed before making a determination about adding specific new categories.
3. Veterans will create new categories for some of the new services.
    - **Maybe true:** Some participants did create new categories for the new services, and gave their reasoning for why they were a better fit. It is likely that more information is needed before making a determination about new categories.
4. Some of the existing, and new, services will cause confusion, and may require plainer language.
    - **Maybe true:** Almost all participants asked for at least one service to be explained to them, and most participants asked about the same few services.

# Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)

1. **Most participants found the pre-determined categories adequate.**
    - **8 of 14 participants** sorted all of their services into the pre-determined categories. Of this group, the general sentiment was that the predetermined categories were sufficient for organizing the available services, and that they did not need to be changed (described differently, or re-worded) in any way.
2. **All participants utilized the new "Administrative" category.**
    - **14 of 14 participants** added services to the "Administrative" category. For the most part, participants were in the greatest alignment for the servies they added to this category. Participants seemed to have the easiest time identifying which services belonged in this category; this is the only category were there was total alignment for one service in particular, and it seemd like the overall sentiment was that administrative services were obviously and intuitively "administrative".
3. **Some particpants suggested new categories for existing services.**
    - **6 of 14 participants** chose to add existing services to new categories. There was definite similarity to the newly created categories: most involved the process of leaving active service, and entering civilian life and/or the VA health care system. Other new categories were more varied.
    - **New categories for existing services, related to leaving active service:**
        - "Onboarding", "Incoming Veterans", "Transition", and "Post-service (aka I'm out - what now?)"
    - **Other new categories for existing services:**
        - "Financial", "Dietary Improvement", "Substance abuse", and "Vocation Rehabilitation & Employment"
4. **A small number of participants suggested new categories for new services.**
    - **2 of 14 participants** chose to add new services to new categories.
    - **New categories for new services:**
        - "Substance abuse," and "Post-service (aka I'm out - what now?)"
5. **There were services that needed plainer description, and/or additional explanation.**
    - **13 of 14 participants** had questions about services, and most of the questions asked were about the same few services. By far, the most confusing/asked about service was "Registry exams", with **13 of 14** requiring a definition.
    - **Services requiring more than one explanation, across participants:**
        - "Registry exams", "Veteran connections", "Returning service member care", "Whole health", "Library services", "Advice nurse", "My HealtheVet Coordinator", and "Privacy office"
6. **How service categorization was distrbuted across participants:**
    - **The "Administrative" category had the most consistent alignment** across participants: participants agreed the most about which services belonged in this cateory.
    - **Some services were much more likely to grouped together** in the same category. For example:
        - "Billing insurance" and "Medical records"
        - "Freedom of Inforation Act requests" and "Privacy office"
        - "Minority Veteran care" and "LGBTQ+ Veteran care"
        - "MOVE! weight management" and "Nutrition, food, and dietary care"
    - **The most popular categories were:**
        - "Administrative", "Social program and services", and "Specialty care"
    - **The least popular categories were:**
        - "Prepare for your visit" and "Mental health care"

# Further research needed

_If there are demographics that were not included in this study or you discovered that more research should be done, make note of that here._

- **More participants needed in general**
    - Certain statistical analysis methods (such as the "Actual agreement dendrogram") provided by Optimal Workshop and used to analyze the card sort data, work best with at least 30 participants. With card sorts, the more participants, the more accurate the data, and I believe this study would benefit from a larger number of participants.
- **LGBTQ+ participants needed**
    - We did not have any identified LGBTQ+ participants, and multiple participants stated that they did not feel qualified to categorize the "LGBTQ+ Veteran care" service. In order to better understand where LGBTQ+ Veterans would categorize services designed for their health care needs, it would be beneficial to to speak with LGBTQ+ Veterans to hear their suggestions.
- **More participants who identify as minority Veterans and/or people of color**
    - While this study had a few participants that identifed as people of color, it was mostly made up of white/caucasian participants. It would be beneficial to speak to more minority Veterans in order to hear more suggestions on how to categorize the "Minority Veteran care" service.
