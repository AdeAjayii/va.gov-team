# Research Goals

As part of the effort to align benefits and services across VAMC pages, we need to determine how Veterans expect services to be categorized. This study is seeking validation for existing services and their categories, as well as for potential new services (tasks, rather, as opposed to official VHA services) identified in [previous services taxonomy audits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/services-taxonomy/taxonomy-research-2021).

# Research Questions

1. Do the existing categories accurately reflect Veteran expectations of where to find services on VAMC pages?
2. Will Veterans create additional categories for existing services?
3. Will Veterans create additional categories for new services?
4. Are there services that are confusing, or need to be described using plainer language?
5. Do existing category names cause confusion, or do they need to described using plainer language?

# Methodology 

This study will utilize a moderated card sort, via [Optimal Workshop's](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/) UX research tools. The card sort allows participants to arrange services into the categories they think fit them best, or, to create new categories if the existing categories aren't a good fit.

- Participants will perform a hybrid card sort for a list of new and currently existing services. The categories will include existing health services headings ("Primary care", "Mental health care", etc.), new suggestions, as well as the option to add additional categories.

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans will associate most services with existing category headings.
    - **Definitely true:** Only some participants created additional categories - most participants sorted new and existing services into the pre-determined categories provided.
2. Veterans will create new categories for some of the existing services.
    - **Maybe true:** Some participants did create new categories for existing services, and gave their reasoning for why those categories were a better fit.
3. Veterans will create new categories for some of the new services.
    - **Maybe true:** Some participants did create new categories for the new services, and gave their reasoning for why they were a better fit.
4. Some of the existing, and new, services will cause confusion, and may require plainer language.
    - **Likely true:** Most participants asked for at least one service to be explained to them, and most participants asked about the same few services.

# Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)

1. **Most participants found the pre-determined categories adequate.**

2. **All participants utilized the new "Administrative" category.**

3. **Some particpants suggested new categories for existing services.**

4. **Some participants suggested new categories for new services.**

5. **There were services that needed plainer description, and/or additional explanation.**

# Next Steps

# Further research needed

_If there are demographics that were not included in this study or you discovered that more research should be done, make note of that here._

- **LGBTQ+ participants needed**
    - We did not have any identified LGBTQ+ participants, and multiple participants stated that they did not feel qualified to categorize the "LGBTQ+ Veteran care" service. In order to better understand where LGBTQ+ Veterans would categorize services designed for their health care needs, it would be beneficial to to speak with LGBTQ+ Veterans to hear their suggestions.
- **More participants who identify as minority Veterans and/or people of color**
    - While this study had a few participants that identifed as people of color, it was mostly made up of white/caucasian participants. It would be beneficial to speak to more minority Veterans in order to hear more suggestions on how to categorize the "Minority Veteran care" service.
