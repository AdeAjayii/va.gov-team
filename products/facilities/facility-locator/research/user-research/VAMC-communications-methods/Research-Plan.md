# VAMC Communication Methods - Research Plan

## Background

[#34431 - Methods for contacting VAMCs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/34431)

Unauthenticated VAMC site pages give Veterans multiple methods for contacting their doctors, patient advocates, and other members of their broader health care team. The variety of communication methods, and their placement on VAMC site pages, needs to be validated with Veteran feedback in order to determine which methods Veterans find the most useful, where it is most useful to Veterans to place this information on site pages, and how Veterans actually go about searching for this information in general.

### OCTO Objectives 

[TBD]

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

### Veteran Journey

[TBD]

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

## Research Goals	

[3 MAIN GOALS IS IDEAL, THINK ABOUT FUTURE RESEARCH FOR MORE THAN 3]

**The main goals of this study are:**
1) To identify where Veterans expect to find methods of contacting their health team.
2) To validate the labels and sub-labels used to describe the communication methods found on VAMC pages.
3) To identify why a Veteran would chose one particular communication method as opposed to another (under what circumstances).

**Secondary goals include collecting supplemental feedback:**
- What is confusing?
- What do they expect?
- What changes or additional things do they suggest?

### Outcome

Currently, not all communication methods available to Veterans are present on each VAMC page. This study will determine which VAMC pages should have what communication methods, and how those communications methods should be described and labled. This usability study will directly inform upcomign design changes VAMC pages.

### Research questions

[BUCKET UNDER GOALS, REORGANIZE?]

1) Where do Veterans expect to find each of the different methods of communication?
	- VA Health Chat
	- Secure messaging
	- VA health connect phone number
	- VA telehealth
	- General phone numbers
2) How do Veterans expect communications methods to labeled/described? 
3) Under what circumstances do Veterans choose a particular communications method?
4) Which communication methods do Veterans prefer, and how does this impact their elevation/placement on VAMC pages?

### Hypotheses

[FOCUS AND CLEAN UP; BUCKET UNDER RESEARCH QUESTIONS, REORGANIZE]

1) Most participants will want additional methods of communication on specific facility health care pages.
2) Most participants will prefer methods of communication *other* than phone numbers.
3) Most participants will find phone number labeling adequate.
4) Most participants will prefer at least one page that list all available communication methods (ie. on the Contact Us page, or something)
5) Most participants will have similar use cases for particular communication methods (ie. secure messaging for appointments)
6) The more top-level the starting point (facility locator, system level, facility level) the more difficult it will be to find a list of communication methods.
7) Most participants will not even know about VA Health Chat.

## Method	

This is a list of the research methods this study will utilize, along with a description of how these methods impact the goals of this study.

**1) Usability testing**

[Usability testing will use staging/production sites as appropriate]

- Method
	- Task flow from specific starting points:
		- VA.gov
		- System-level health care page
		- Facility-level health care page
- Goals
	- Gives us data on how Veterans search for communication methods on VA.gov, where Veterans generally expect to find this information, and their overall impressions of this experience.

**3) Tree test**

[Tree testing via Optimal Workshop]

- Method
	- A tree test using system-level health care links/headings
	- A tree test using facility-level health care links/headings
- Goals
	- Gives us specific data on where Veterans feel communiction methods should be located on VAMC pages, based on side navigation links, and page headings.

**4) Contexual inquiry**

[Bespoke Mural, prototype, A/B testing, etc. as appropriate]

- Method
	- Asking questions about specific page elements, including labels, headings, Veterans general expectations per-page, and lesser-known communications methods like VA Health Chat.
- Goals
	- Gives us feedback on communications elements themselves, as opposed to where they are located. This is also a chance to capture general feedback and suggestions that may not have come up in previous tasks.

### Location

Remote usability testing will be conducting via Zoom.

### Research materials

- [Link to prototype](url goes here) [TBD - may use staging/production & bespoke tree test/prototype]
	
## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

Using Perigean recruiting, we would like to schedule **20 participants** to reach our goal of observing 10 participants.

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- *Must be enrolled in VA healthcare*
- *Laptop or desktop computer only*
	- *For this study, mobile devices may introduce technical difficulties, or make it more difficult for participants to complete the task*
- *Be able to screenshare via Zoom*
	- *Please confirm beforehand that participant is able to use Zoom, and is familiar with screen sharing*
- *At least 2 participants under 35 years old*
- *At least 2 participants over 55 years old*
- *At least 1 participant with cognitive disabilities*
- *At least 5 participants with no college degree or professional certificates*
- *At least 3 participants of color*

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
- *Mix of Veterans and Caregivers*
- *All genders*
- *A mix of rural and urban participants*

## Timeline

[TBD]

If you are using Perigean to recruit please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote research, 2+ weeks for in person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions

[TBD]

### Length of sessions

Scheduled session should be for **1 hour** with the expectation they take around 45 minutes to complete.

### Availability

[TBD]
