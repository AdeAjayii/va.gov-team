# VAMC Communication Methods - Research Plan

## Background

[#34431 - Methods for contacting VAMCs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/34431)

Unauthenticated VAMC site pages give Veterans multiple methods for contacting their doctors, patient advocates, and other members of their broader health care team. The variety of communication methods, and their placement on VAMC site pages, needs to be validated with Veteran feedback in order to determine which methods Veterans find the most useful, where it is most useful to Veterans to place this information on site pages, and how Veterans actually go about searching for this information in general.

### OCTO Objectives 

[TBD]

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

### Veteran Journey

[TBD]

Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

## Research Goals	

[3 MAIN GOALS IS IDEAL, THINK ABOUT FUTURE RESEARCH FOR MORE THAN 3]

**The main goals of this study are:**
1) To identify where Veterans expect to find methods of contacting their health team.
2) To validate the labels and sub-labels used to describe the communication methods found on VAMC pages.
3) To identify why a Veteran would chose one particular communication method as opposed to another (under what circumstances).

**Secondary goals include collecting supplemental feedback:**
- What is confusing?
- What do they expect?
- What changes or additional things do they suggest?

### Outcome

Currently, not all communication methods available to Veterans are present on each VAMC page. This study will determine which VAMC pages should have what communication methods, and how those communications methods should be described and labled. This usability study will directly inform upcomign design changes VAMC pages.

### Research questions

[BUCKET UNDER GOALS, REORGANIZE]

1) Where do Veterans expect to find each of the different methods of communication?
	- VA Health Chat
	- Secure messaging
	- VA health connect phone number
	- VA telehealth
	- General phone numbers
2) How do Veterans expect communications methods to labeled/described? 
3) Under what circumstances do Veterans choose a particular communications method?
4) Which communication methods do Veterans prefer, and how does this impact their elevation/placement on VAMC pages?

### Hypothesis

[BUCKET UNDER RESEARCH QUESTIONS, REORGANIZE]

1) Most participants will want additional methods of communication on facility health care pages.
2) Most participants will find it confusing/unintuitive to locate certain existing methods of communication.
3) 

What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so donâ€™t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Method	

[POSSIBLE METHODS]

- Usability testing
	- Task flow from specific starting points
- Tree test
	- Health care system level links/headings
	- Facility level links/headinds
- Contexual inquiry
	- Labels & sub-labels
	- Expectations per page
	- General experience and preferences

### Location

Remote usability testing will be conducting via Zoom.

### Research materials

- [Link to prototype](url goes here) [TBD - may use staging/production & bespoke tree test/prototype]
	
## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach

Using Perigean recruiting, we would like to schedule **20 participants** to reach our goal of observing 10 participants.

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
- *Must be enrolled in VA healthcare*
- *Laptop or desktop computer only*
	- *For this study, mobile devices may introduce technical difficulties, or make it more difficult for participants to complete the task*
- *Be able to screenshare via Zoom*
	- *Please confirm beforehand that participant is able to use Zoom, and is familiar with screen sharing*
- *At least 2 participants under 35 years old*
- *At least 2 participants over 55 years old*
- *At least 1 participant with cognitive disabilities*
- *At least 5 participants with no college degree or professional certificates*
- *At least 3 participants of color*

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
- *Mix of Veterans and Caregivers*
- *All genders*
- *A mix of rural and urban participants*

## Timeline

[TBD]

If you are using Perigean to recruit please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote research, 2+ weeks for in person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions

[TBD]

### Length of sessions

Scheduled session should be for **1 hour** with the expectation they take around 45 minutes to complete.

### Availability

[TBD]
