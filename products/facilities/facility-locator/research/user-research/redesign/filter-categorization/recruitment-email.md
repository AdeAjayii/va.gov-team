**Subject:** VA.gov invites you to participate in card sorting exercise and earn [$XX]

Hello, 

The VA.gov team is running a card sorting exercise for the Facility Locator portion of the website. In an effort to improve the website and understand how to organize information on the tool, we are looking for Veterans who may be interested in giving input on how to organize the way location services are shown. 

**What will I be doing in this session?**
You will be sent a link asking you to organize services provided by VA facilities into categories and then name each group in a way that describes the content. 

**How long is a session?**
The session is self guided and should take you 10-15 minutes to complete.

**Interested in participating?**
Please write back to obtain a link to the study and a code in order to get a thank you gift card.
