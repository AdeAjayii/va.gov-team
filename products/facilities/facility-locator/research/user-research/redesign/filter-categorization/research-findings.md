# Facility Locator Filter Card Sorting WIP
May 2020

## Methodology
We launched an unmoderated self-guided card sort exercise and sent it via link to Veterans using our Perigean contract.

## Summary


Of the participants, these are the high level numbers:
- 44 participants completed the study
- 28 participants abandoned
- 98% located in the United States
- Median of 5 categories created (277 total categories created)
- Average time to complete was 16 minutes 33 seconds 

## Themes

**Cemetery and burial cards were most often grouped together**

**Veterans grouped all medical services together and often created a "medical specialty" or similar category.**

**Cards were often grouped together by similar name or context.**

**Participants had dificulty classifying some services** and created new categories for them or listed them as "other".

## Detailed Findings
The participants created a total of 277 unique categories. The following categories are what we combined them into **(need to reword this)**

| Category      | Cards                     |
| ------------- |:-------------------------:|
| Category name | card, card, card, card, card
