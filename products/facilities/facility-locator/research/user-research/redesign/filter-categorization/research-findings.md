# Facility Locator Filter Card Sorting WIP
May 2020

## Methodology
We launched an unmoderated self-guided card sort exercise and sent it via link to Veterans using our Perigean contract.

## Summary


Of the participants, these are the high level numbers:
- 44 participants completed the study
- 28 participants abandoned
- 98% located in the United States
- Median of 5 categories created (277 total categories created)
- Average time to complete was 16 minutes 33 seconds 

## Themes

**Cemetery and burial cards were most often grouped together** and usually had the most category names. The most popular category names contained the terms "after-life" "burial" or "death" 

**Veterans grouped all medical services together and often created a "medical specialty" or similar category.**

**Cards were often grouped together by similar name or context.**

**Participants had dificulty classifying some services** and created new categories for them or listed them as "other". This could be due to the name of the service being ambiguous. For example, Infectious Disease.

## Detailed Findings
The participants created a total of 277 unique categories. Below is a summarized version, created by grouping like categories together:

| Category      | Contents                  |
| ------------- |:------------------------- |
| Admin and Benefits | Most cards sorted into these categories pertain to benefits assistance, including education and employment help. |
| Burial, cemetery, end of life | All cemeteries or lots were sorted into these categories. 3 participants also include bereavement counseling |

| Community-based | Community urgent care, community outreach and education, and homeless assistance were sorted by 3-4 participants, |
| Counseling | These categories differ from mental health in that participants sorted these by name. Every card including the term "counseling" was sorted into these categories. |
| Disability | card |
| Education or Employement | 3 to 6 Veterans sorted cards containing the terms "education" or "employment" into these categories |
| Emergency/Immediate | VA urgent care, urgent care, emergency care, and community urgent care were sorted into these categories by 7 participants. 3 participants also included Critical Care specialty cards |
