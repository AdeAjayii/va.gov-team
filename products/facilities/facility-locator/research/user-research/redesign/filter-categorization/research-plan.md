# Research Plan for Facility Locator, May 2020

## Goals	
The goal of this study is to understand how Veterans would expect the facility locator location services to be organized when filtering their search results. 

**Research questions**
- How will Veterans want to organize the filter contents?
- Will the current services taxonomy be validated?

**Hypothesis**
- line item

## Method	
1.	We will be sending a link to Veterans to participate in an unmoderated card sorting activity.	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	

## Participants and Recruitment	
- At least 30 card sort particpants of all ages. (Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

**Recruitment strategy** 
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact UX lead.)	

## When? 	
Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
- The card sorting exercise should take participants 10-20 minutes to complete.

Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	

## Team Roles	
Since this is an unmoderated study, there will be no team members present for the sessions.
