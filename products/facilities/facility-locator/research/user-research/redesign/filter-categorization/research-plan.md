# Research Plan for Facility Locator, May 2020

## Goals	
The goal of this study is to understand how Veterans would expect the facility locator location services to be organized when filtering their search results. 

**Research questions**
- How will Veterans want to organize the filter contents?
- Will the current services taxonomy be validated?
- How do Veterans expect to search for facilities?
- How would Veterans organize/cateogorize services relative to facilities?
- Which filters would Veterans use to refine their searches and why?
- How should filters/services change for Veterans depending on the facility type?

**Hypothesis**
- Veterans will group services together that are not currently listed in the same categories
- Veterans will group services by function over title/name
- New groups/categories will emerge that do not currently exist (i.e a "Mental Health" category)

## Method	
We will be sending an OptimalSort link to Veterans to participate in an unmoderated card sorting activity.	This method will help us answer our research questions by providing Veterans the opportunity to complete the study in their own time without influence.

## Participants and Recruitment	
We will recruit 30-60 participants representing a population under age 40 yrs and over 60 years, preferably with a mix of urban/rural locations.

**Recruitment strategy** 
TBD

(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact UX lead.)	

## When? 	
Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
- The card sorting exercise should take participants 10-20 minutes to complete.

The card sort link will be tested by a member of the Facility Locator team prior to sending it out.	

## Team Roles	
Since this is an unmoderated study, there will be no team members present for the sessions. 

## Resources
