This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research is to establish foundational knowledge of Veterans' Facility Locator search experience while using assistive technology on desktop and mobile devices. Understanding how Veterans, with low to no vision, who use keyboard, voice and/or other assistive technology, try to complete facility search tasks will help us plan future product improvements so that all Veterans can easily perform a search and consume results.

In this research study, participants were asked to describe how they use their assistive technology to search for location information online. They were also asked to perform three facility search tasks to guage high level usability of the tools while using assistive technology.

 - Find your nearest VA
 - Find a dermatologist a dermatologist at your nearest VA
 - Find the closest VA hospital to where you'll be staying in preparation for an upcoming trip


## Participants
We talked to **7 Veterans**, if differing levels of vision, each of whom used a unique combination of devices and assistive technology and displayed varying degrees of experience using their assistive technology. 

Due to technical issues, not all participants were able to share their typical combination of AT in its entirety via Zoom. Therefore, some aspects were not able to be observed by researchers during testing. Technologies not observed during testing are noted as follows:

§ Audio not shared during testing
† Video not shared during testing
¶ Other assitive tech not observable during testing

# | VISION | DEVICE | ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY | EXPERIENCE LEVEL
---|-----------------------|--------------|------------------|------------
P1 | Completely blind | Desktop | † JAWS screen reader | Advanced |
P2 | Completely blind |  Desktop |  §† JAWS screen reader | Advanced |
P4 | Cognitive & Dyslexia | mobile iPhone | §† iOS dictation | Beginner |
P6 | Low vision | mobile iPhone | § magic keyboard | Beginner on iOS |
P7 | Completely blind |  Desktop | JAWS screen reader | Advanced |
P9 | Low vision |  Desktop | ¶ ZoomText screen reader | Intermediate |
P0 | Low vision |  Desktop | ¶ Fusion (JAWS + ZoomText) | Beginner |
