This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research is to establish foundational knowledge of Veterans' Facility Locator search experience while using assistive technology on desktop and mobile devices. Understanding how Veterans, with low to no vision, who use keyboard, voice and/or other assistive technology, try to complete facility search tasks will help us plan future product improvements so that all Veterans can easily perform a search and consume results.

In this research study, participants were asked to describe how they use their assistive technology to search for location information online. They were also asked to perform three facility search tasks to guage high level usability of the tools while using assistive technology.

 - Find your nearest VA
 - Find a dermatologist a dermatologist at your nearest VA
 - Find the closest VA hospital to where you'll be staying in preparation for an upcoming trip


## Participants
We talked to **7 Veterans**, if differing levels of vision, each of whom used a unique combination of devices and assistive technology and displayed varying degrees of experience using their assistive technologies. 

P# | LEVEL OF VISION | DEVICE | ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY | EXPERIENCE LEVEL
---|---------------------|--------------|------------------|------------
P1 | Completely blind | Desktop | JAWS screen reader † | Advanced |
P2 | Completely blind |  Desktop | JAWS screen reader §† | Advanced |
P4 | Cognitive & Dyslexia | mobile iPhone | iOS dictation §† | Beginner |
P6 | Low vision | mobile iPhone | magic keyboard § | Beginner on iOS |
P7 | Completely blind |  Desktop | JAWS screen reader | Advanced |
P9 | Low vision |  Desktop | ZoomText screen reader ¶ | Intermediate |
P0 | Low vision |  Desktop | Fusion (JAWS + ZoomText) ¶ | Beginner |

Due to technical issues, not all participants were able to share their typical or preferred combination of AT in its entirety via Zoom. Therefore, some aspects were not able to be observed by researchers during testing. Technologies not observed during testing are noted as follows:

 - § Audio not shared during testing
 - † Video not shared during testing
 - ¶ Other assitive tech not observable during testing

## Initial Findings

### User context and behavior while using assistive tech

- Veterans with low to no vision use many different types of assistive technologies for navigating websites and the information that they encounter on them. What they choose to use and how they use it can vary widely and spontaneously depending on their context and/or immediate situation.

  - P1: Navigates quickly through pages with JAWS and may miss key content that isn't optimized for screen readers, e.g. 'skip to content' on VA.gov. 
  - P4: Post retirement diagnosis of Dyslexia means college graduation and endless bookists that can be tackled audibly on iPhone/iPad. Heavy reliance on dictation (spelling is challenging) with mic fearure on OS. Easier than Dragon. Now Siri.  _"I finally started using Siri, my grandson taught me this."_
   - P6: Dictating to Siri on iPhone while out and about > JAWS at home on desktop 
   - P7: JAWS on desktop at home. Navigates for wife who's driving by memorizing directions or playing back dictation from his Victor Reader Stream. Liks VoiceOver but not comfortable using mobile with "all of the small taps".
   - P9: ZoomText to magnify content on websites can't locate items on a page when laid out far apart. Uses a high contrast keyboard to type.
   - P10: Starts with mobile, will transition to desktop for more involved tasks. Uses ZoomText with familiar websites and JAWS when unfamiliar. _"When I’m looking up a location a phone is more convenient and easier...The search feature, I don’t have to wait for it to boot up. Siri is there. Then I looked at it on my desktop computer to Google events." "JAWS can go through everything and it’s easier to find stuff if I’m unfamiliar with the website or the content. It helps me find things quicker."_

- Assistive technology users may be advanced users of one device and novice users of another where their knowledge limits them to a small handful of features and functionality. Manipulating the 'Service type' combo box on Facility locator using an iPhone was difficult and unfamiliar to one user who was more skilled at using JAWS on desktop.
- Orienting oneself on a website can be unpredictable, cumbersome and very time consuming for users with low to no vision. Participants used various methods to figure out what page they were on, what a page is about and what they can do on it. We observed JAWS users:
  - List all the headings on the page (Insert + F6) 
  - List all the links on a page (Insert + F7), 52 links on the homepage
  - Navigating to the next edit box on a page i.e. input fields (global search didn't appear as an edit box)
  - List all buttons (if you know to look for one)

 > P2: "You know... when I go to a new page... it takes me maybe 10 or 15 minutes to get familiar with the page and what's on it ok? I like to experience all the elements on the page... you know... how many checkboxes there are... how many headings, how many radio buttons... I like to go through that. So I just get an idea on what that page is about."


### Searching for location information online and on VA.gov

1. Veterans are more likely to rely on VA location information provided by search engine results than seek out information on VA.gov. (Participants use Google, Siri/safari, Bing, DuckDuckGo)
2. 4 Veterans had a hard time finding Facility Locator.
3. 4 participants were able to easily complete a search on Facility Locator.
4. 3 Veterans used the 'use my location' but some Veterans were hesitant, one mentioning "big brother".
5. When a search produces no results, screen reader users are not alerted which is confusing.
6. 4 Veterans used global search to find a location or dermatologist. Some participants didn't think to look for healthcare in a location finder.
7. "Get directions" was not audible or decipherable for (3) JAWS screenreader users. 
8. Phone numbers that lack labels can confuse screenreader users. One participant interpreted a phone number as GPS coordinates becasue it was read directly following "Get directions".
9. Results listing letter and mileage combination was confusing for one user. User hears "A1.5 heading level 3 Memphis Vah Medical Center" not understanding that it was the first listing and is 1.5 miles away from the searched location.  
10. Map view was hidden for most users and not tested with screenreaders
