This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research is to establish foundational knowledge of Veterans' Facility Locator search experience while using assistive technology on desktop and mobile devices. Understanding how Veterans, with low to no vision, who use keyboard, voice and/or other assistive technology, try to complete facility search tasks will help us plan future product improvements so that all Veterans can easily perform a search and consume results.

In this research study, participants were asked to describe how they use their assistive technology to search for location information online. They were also asked to perform three facility search tasks to guage high level usability of the tools while using assistive technology.

 - Find your nearest VA
 - Find a dermatologist a dermatologist at your nearest VA
 - Find the closest VA hospital to where you'll be staying in preparation for an upcoming trip


## Participants
We talked to **7 Veterans**, if differing levels of vision, each of whom used a unique combination of devices and assistive technology and displayed varying degrees of experience using their assistive technologies. 

P# | LEVEL OF VISION | DEVICE | ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY | EXPERIENCE LEVEL
---|---------------------|--------------|------------------|------------
P1 | Completely blind | Desktop | JAWS screen reader † | Advanced |
P2 | Completely blind |  Desktop | JAWS screen reader §† | Advanced |
P4 | Cognitive & Dyslexia | mobile iPhone | iOS dictation §† | Beginner |
P6 | Low vision | mobile iPhone | magic keyboard § | Beginner on iOS |
P7 | Completely blind |  Desktop | JAWS screen reader | Advanced |
P9 | Low vision |  Desktop | ZoomText screen reader ¶ | Intermediate |
P0 | Low vision |  Desktop | Fusion (JAWS + ZoomText) ¶ | Beginner |

Due to technical issues, not all participants were able to share their typical or preferred combination of AT in its entirety via Zoom. Therefore, some aspects were not able to be observed by researchers during testing. Technologies not observed during testing are noted as follows:

 - § Audio not shared during testing
 - † Video not shared during testing
 - ¶ Other assitive tech not observable during testing

## Initial Findings

### Behavior and lifestyle using assistive tech

1. Veterans with low to no vision use many different types of assistive technologies for navigating websites and the information that they encounter on them. What they choose to use and how they use it can vary widely and spontaneously depending on their context and/or immediate situation.

 - P6: Dictating to Siri on iPhone while out and about > JAWS at home on desktop 
 - P7: JAWS on desktop at home. Navigates for wife who's driving by memorizing directions or playing back dictation from his Victor Reader Stream. 
 - P9: ZoomText to magnify content on websites can't locate items on a page when laid out far apart. Uses a high contrast keyboard to type.
 - P10: Starts with mobile, will transition to desktop for more involved tasks. Uses ZoomText with familiar websites and JAWS when unfamiliar.
 > "When I’m looking up a location a phone is more convenient and easier...The search feature, I don’t have to wait for it to boot up. Siri is there. Then I looked at it on my desktop computer to Google events. 
 > JAWS can go through everything and it’s easier to find stuff if I’m unfamiliar with the website or the content. It helps me find things quicker.

2. Veterans are more likely to rely on VA location information provided by search engine results than by using facility locator (participants use Google, Siri/safari, Bing, DuckDuckGo). 
3. Beginner to intermediate users of assistive technology may only leverage a small handful of features on their assistive technology devices.
