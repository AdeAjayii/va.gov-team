# Homepage research findings from Facility Locator - Assistive Technology Discovery and Usability Study

## Key Findings

### Different navigation methods produce inconsistent user experiences, page hierarchy and content perceptions of the VA.gov homepage.

-   Browsing by heading - A lack heading level hierarchy creates an inaccurate and confusing representation of the content available on the homepage. The user hears that there is one H1 (Access and manage your VA benefits and health care).  H2s are sometimes links and sometimes groups of links but there is no content categorization. A user hears that there are 80+ links but no way to know that over half of them are footer links that they might be able to ignore on a second listen.

-   Skip to content - using this method drops a user at the "Service member benefits" link, bypassing the "Top 4" boxes. This confused one user who later returned to the homepage, who proceeded to navigate by heading level and then experienced a completely different set of information. Leaving him convinced that he'd never been to the homepage before.

-   Regions - the lack of delineated regions means users perceive all footer links as part of the page content links forcing them to hear all 46 of them each time when they navigate by 'reading page', element by element which is slow and cumbersome, but likely behavior when all else fails. This added to the cognitive overload of orienting themselves as they had to process all pieces of information when completing their first task.

-   Using global navigation menu - [Preface: Two desktop JAWS users in the study size down their browser viewports when navigating websites. This created a hybrid desktop/mobile experience for one user where they got the mobile version of the global menu button while on desktop.] This component was difficult to manipulate for both desktop and mobile users. It is unclear to them that this is a main global menu because it is not labeled as expected nor does it announce its current state consistently.

-   Find - this method was more successful for users in this study. Some users easily found Find a VA Location when using a keyword like 'location', some locating it in the footer only.

-   Edit box - when arriving at the homepage, JAWS announces that there is no edit box. The expectation is that a search box would appear as an edit box. Most participants used the search box once they knew it was available including for location searches, even after having used Facility Locator in a previous task.

### 4/7 Veterans had difficulty finding Facility Locator from VA.gov.

-   P1: Three failed attempts created an unpredictable, confusing, and frustrating user experience. The linked figures below detail this user's wayfinding attempts and illustrate how difficult it was for this user to orient himself along the way. [[See case study](#case-study-p1)]

-   1\. First, user tries "skip to content" on VA.gov homepage and is taken to the 'Service member benefits' H2 . From this point, the user was mentally stuck trying to complete the task within a 'benefits' section that would apply to him [[Figure P1-1](#figure-P1-1)] 

-   2\. Second, navigates homepage by headings from Service member benefits  [[Figure P1-2](#figure-P1-2)] 

-   3\. Third, navigates homepage by headings from the top of the page, and thinks that he is on a new page.  [[Figure P1-3](#figure-P1-3)]

-   4\. Moderator prompts user to try links list but still runs into issues [[Figure P1-4](#figure-P1-4)] 

-   5\. Moderator prompts user to try using the global nav menu  [[Figure P1-5](#figure-P1-5)]  This user experienced the mobile version of the menu and when he used JAWS 'Find' to type 'F' for 'Find a VA Location' he did not notice it until he repeated this method later while the global nav menu was in its expanded state.

-   P2:  1. Tries "L" for location within headings list, 2. Links list, finds "Find a VA Location"

-   "So its 'Find a location.' So, first letter navigation [tried L] probably wouldn't help me too much because I would think of it as 'Locations' vs 'Find a Location'."

-   P6:  [Inexperienced Safari/iPhone user who had never been on VA.gov, (normally relies on Siri but unable to during the session), used a mix of gestures and magic keyboard] 1. Navigates by "Reading page" from top to bottom, finds the global search field easily.

-   Types in "Mental clinic" in global search which does not give him location related results.

-   P10: Tries many methods because she ran into a number of technical issues with her A.T. Would have preferred to use Siri but was unable to. 

### 4/7 Veterans used global search to find a location or dermatologist.

## Exhibits

### Case Study P1

#### Completely blind participant navigating VA.gov homepage using JAWS

Three failed attempts created an unpredictable, confusing, and frustrating user experience. The linked figures below detail this user's wayfinding attempts and illustrate how difficult it was for this user to orient himself along the way. [**Note:** To understand how other navigation methods may or may not work for this user, the moderator directed the user for attempts 4 and 5]

P1. used, ‘Skip to content’ on VA.gov homepage, on his first of three failed attempts to complete task number two (looking for a Dermatologist near you). The participant is taken to the ‘Service member benefits’ H2. From this point, the user was mentally stuck on trying to complete the task within a ‘benefits’ category that would apply to him. Notice the user’s scanning behavior, as he listens to elements on the page multiple times to understand where he is, what the page is about and where he should go next. This attempt took two minutes and fifteen seconds. On his third attempt, the participant tries to navigate by listening to the headings on the page from the top. Since he did not use ‘skip to content’, this time the homepage appeared to have completely different content than on his first visit.

##### P1, Attempt #3, starts at the top of the page navigating via headings

[Moderator restates the task of finding a Dermatologist.  User explains that it would be a subset of health benefits. Starts to browse the page for the third time, using headings but this time from the top of the page. This time, he does not skip to content.]

1\. Goes to top, [its unclear what user clicked]\

10\. Advances, hears "Schedule and manage health appointments"\
11\. Advances, hears "View your lab and test results"\

  > "It's like it skipped me to myHealtheVet"

[stops]

  > "Do you understand one thing I said? I typed in VA.gov a while ago and this is not the page that it took me to. So, I went back a page. I don't know what you see but according to my screen reader, I haven't been to this page before. I didn't hear any of this stuff previously"

  > ... "Why in heaven's name did it take me to the middle of the page?"

##### P1, Attempt #4.

[User is prompted to use links list]

  > "I really dislike the lists link; it doesn't always put everything in the list. That's the last thing I would do... See, this particular way, right here, to me, maybe I don't do it because it's like a 'blind only' thing and I rather navigate the page like everybody else does."

[Does not find "Find a VA Location" in the list using 'F']

...

[Later, user opens links list while global menu is open and does encounter 'Find a VA location']

  > "see, that links list thing doesn't work because it's in a menu."

##### P1, Attempt 5.

[User is prompted to use global menu]

"menu button [can] be a great thing but its new that a screen reader will actually read it. On a lot of web pages that link will drive you crazy because..." [navigates to menu] 

1\. Menu button is focused\
2\. Hears, "Search button collapsed",  activates button\
[menu is now expanded]\

15\. Advances, hears "Visited link home"\
16\. Advances, hears "VA Benefits and Health care"\
17\. Advances, hears "About VA"\
18\. Advances, hears "Find a VA Location"

   > "Right there" 

[Mod:Tell me about that menu]

   > "Well, first of all, I wasn't even sure it was reading the menu because the screen will change. That's why I arrowed back up. It's usually helpful, if when I hit the menu and the menu dropped down, and I arrowed back up, it would at least say 'menu open' so I know when the menu started because right now I'm assuming this is under that menu but it doesn't really tell me, or say 'menu'."

[Later] 

> "Closed button collapsed. What does that mean?"

#### Figure 2

Two JAWS users, whose tech we were able to see and hear, shared a similar behavior of minimizing windows not in use and scaling down the size of their browser viewports. This can create a hybrid mobile/desktop experience for some users.
