## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Leyda. Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with there being a notetaker and two of my teammates assisting me on this call including an accessibility specialist [name] should you need any help with technology during the session. I can tell you a little more about who we are and what we’re doing before we go any further.

I'm a website designer and researcher and as a team we work on making improvements to VA's websites. We reach out to Veterans from time to time to get their input to make sure we're on the right track with the web pages that we're building. Today, we want to learn how we can improve VA.gov for blind Veterans and Veterans with low vision.

- **Are you comfortable proceeding with this session?**
    - If no:
    - Is there anything we can do to make you feel more comfortable?

*get verbal confirmation or end session
    - If yes:

Thank you, we’re excited to talk with you today.

I want to give you an idea of what this call will be like:

- The entire session should take between an hour and a half.  I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic. Feel free to let me know if you need a break at any time.
- We'll start the session with a couple warm up questions.
- Then, we'll be reviewing parts of the VA.gov website together.
- Throughout the session, I may ask you about your thoughts and opinions about the pages or features but there are no right or wrong answers. We're not testing you. We're actually testing the website to see how we can make it better for all Veterans. So, I welcome your honest and candid feedback but if at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can simply move on to the next question.
- In this session, I'll be having you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along and I'll help you through that.
- Note to moderator: [If sending links during the session, ask before recording begins to avoid capturing PII information:] 
    - We may send you links to go to during the session. Do you have a communication preference? (if desktop, email/zoom chat; if mobile, email/text -- Zoom chat not recommended since it’s a bit unwieldy on a screen reader, especially for mobile users) 
- Finally, this session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. I personally destroy this recording after I analyze it, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

## Recording permission

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**
    - If yes:
     - Once I start recording, I will ask you once again so that the confirmation is captured in the recording.

[Start recording to the Cloud]

- I have started recording. So, I'd like to confirm:
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"

## Tech set-up

Next, I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. 
- Did you receive the checklist for our session from Shannon or Brian? 
- We will quickly run through that right now.

Checklist:
- Are you using a computer or mobile phone during our session today? 
- Mac or Windows? 
- iOS or Android?
- Do you have Zoom installed? 
- Are you wearing headphones today? If so, would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? I'm asking so that I can hear your screen reader during the session.
- What browser are you using today?
- Do you have a screen reader on this device?
- What kind of screen reader do you use?
- How long have you been using it?
- Are you using a screen magnifier today?
- Are there any other assistive technologies that you use?
- Do you know your screen reader's verbosity setting? High, medium, low?

## Warm-up Questions 

Thank you for working through that with us.

So, to get us started and to get to know each other a little bit, again I'm a website designer and researcher. I'm trying to learn how best to improve websites when used with screen readers. And I'll be honest, this is new territory for me. So, I may ask some dumb questions at times but I'll do my best.  

- Can you tell me briefly about yourself, anything you’d like me to know is fine.
- Can you describe to me how you use your screen reader?"

Thank you for sharing that.


Thanks for sharing that. 

## TASKS


## Post-Task Interview

Those are all the questions that I had for you today. 

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?


## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
