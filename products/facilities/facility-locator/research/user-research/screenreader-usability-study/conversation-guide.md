## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Leyda. Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with there being a notetaker and two of my teammates assisting me on this call including an accessibility specialist [name] should you need any help with technology during the session. I can tell you a little more about who we are first too if you'd like.

I'm a website designer and researcher and as a team we work on making improvements to VA's websites. We reach out to Veterans from time to time to get their input to make sure we're on the right track with the pages we're building. Today, we want to learn how we can improve VA.gov for blind Veterans and Veterans with low vision.

Before we get started, I want to give you an idea of what this call will be like:

- This entire session should take about an hour and a half.
- We'll start the session with a couple warm up questions.
- Then, we'll be reviewing parts of the VA.gov website together.
- Throughout the session, I'll be asking you about your thoughts and opinions about the information and content on the pages but there are no right or wrong answers. We're not testing you. We're actually testing the designs and the information contained on the pages to see how we can make them better for Veterans. So, I welcome your honest and candid feedback but if at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can simply move on to the next question. 
- You also have the right to leave this session at any time should you feel uncomfortable with continuing.
- In this session, I'll be having you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along and I'll help you through that. 
- First, I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. 
- Can you confirm for me what type of device you'll be using today?
[CHOOSE PATH]
    - Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.
- To confirm, were you able to download and set up the Zoom application on your phone ahead of this meeting?

_For iPhone:_
**For those joined by iPhone and Zoom already**
- OK great. 
- Do you normally use this device for browsing the internet with a screenreader?

**If YES**
[SKIP TO SCREEN SHARE INSTRUCTIONS]

**NO: Still needs to join by device with screenreader**
- We'd like to send you a zoom link for you to open on your phone so you can join this meeting. We can send this to you by email [read email] or by text. Do you have a preference?  
- [Send through Veteran's preferred communication channel]
- When you open the link, you should be taken to the Zoom application automatically. Zoom will ask for access to your microphone and video. We only need your audio for this session, so please tap "Allow" for the microphone prompt. Feel free to tap "Don't Allow" for video permissions if you are not comfortable having your face on camera.
- You will then be asked to join audio. Please tap "Join audio."
- Once you're in the call...

_SCREEN SHARE INSTRUCTIONS_
- please find the "Share content" button. It will be at the bottom center of your app. Double tap that button and then double tap "Screen." Then, find the "Start Broadcast" button and double tap it. You'll hear a counter "3, 2, 1" and the screen share will begin.
- Great, now I can see your phone screen!
- If you need to stop sharing during this session you can click 'Stop Broadcast'

- **If no, go to backup plan**

_For Android:_ **Needs custom accessibility script**
- OK great. When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll want to tap on the phone screen, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe)

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**
- [Instructions on talk out loud activity, we need to rely on the participant to explain what is happening and what their pain points are]


## Recording permission

[USER IS SHARING]

Great! Thanks for working through that with me. 

Finally, this session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after the call is analyzed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 

 - If yes: 
 
**Once I start recording, I will ask you once again so that the confirmation is captured in the recording.** 

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- **I have started recording.** So, I'd like to confirm:

Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions 

So, to get us started and to get to know you a little bit,

- How would you introduce yourself to a friend of a friend?

Thanks for sharing that.
