## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Leyda. Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with there being a notetaker and two of my teammates assisting me on this call including an accessibility specialist [name] should you need any help with technology during the session. I can tell you a little more about who we are first too if you'd like.

I'm a website designer and researcher and as a team we work on making improvements to VA's websites. We reach out to Veterans from time to time to get their input to make sure we're on the right track with the pages we're building. Today, we want to learn how we can improve VA.gov for blind Veterans and Veterans with low vision.

Before we get started, I want to give you an idea of what this call will be like:

- This entire session should take about an hour.
- We'll start the session with a couple warm up questions.
- Then, we'll be reviewing parts of the VA.gov website together.
- Throughout the session, I'll be asking you about your thoughts and opinions about the information and content on the pages but there are no right or wrong answers. We're not testing you. We're actually testing the designs and the information contained on the pages to see how we can make them better for Veterans. So, I welcome your honest and candid feedback but if at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can simply move on to the next question. 
- You also have the right to leave this session at any time should you feel uncomfortable with continuing.
- In this session, I'll be having you share your Zoom screen so that I can follow along and I'll help you through that. 
- First, I want to make sure your technology is ready to go for this session. Can you confirm for me what type of device you'll be using today?
    - Great, that helps me troubleshoot with you if we run into any problems.

_For iPhone:_

- OK great. To confirm, were you able to download and set up the Zoom application on your phone ahead of this meeting?

- **If yes**
- We'd like to send you a zoom link for you to open on your phone so you can join this meeting. We can send this to you by email [read email], by text, or through zoom's built in chat feature. Do you have a preference?  
- [Send through Veteran's preferred communication channel]
- When you open the link, you should be taken to the Zoom application automatically. Zoom will ask for access to your microphone and video. Since you have already joined by video, feel free to tap "don't allow" for both. You will then be asked to join audio. Please tap "No audio."
- Once you're in the call, please find the "Share content" button. It will be at the bottom center of your app. Double tap that button and then double tap "Screen." Then, find the "Start Broadcast" button and double tap it. You'll hear a counter "3, 2, 1" and the screen share will begin.
- Great, now I can see your phone screen!
- If you need to stop sharing during this session you can click 'Stop Broadcast'
- We'll send links to your preferred [email or text] for the websites we'll be asking you to visit.

- **If no, go to backup plan**

_For Android:_ **Needs custom accessibility script**
- OK great. When you are inside the Zoom application on your phone, you'll want to tap on the phone screen, you'll see a few buttons at the bottom. For instance, Share and three dots over to the right. If you tap on those dots, you'll also see a function called "Chat". If you don't tap the screen for a while, the icons at the bottom will hide. You can tap anywhere on the screen to get them to show. The ones that will be important for us today are "chat" and "share." Any questions?
- Tap "Share"
- Tap "Screen"
- May give a "sensitive info" alert
- May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
- Tap "Start now" (maybe)

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**
- [Instructions on talk out loud activity, we need to rely on the participant to explain what is happening and what their pain points are]


## Recording permission

[USER IS SHARING]

Great! Thanks for working through that with me. 

Finally, this session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after the call is analyzed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 

 - If yes: 
 
**Once I start recording, I will ask you once again so that the confirmation is captured in the recording.** 

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- **I have started recording.** So, I'd like to confirm:

Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 


## Warm-up Questions 

So, to get us started 

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

Thanks for sharing that. 

### Counseling service familiarity

For the purpose of this session, we'll be mostly focused on 
  
  - Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:
  - can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?
  - have you participated in any of these services?
  
Thank you for sharing that. 
  
### Internet search scenario questions
 
I'm going to give you a scenario to consider. 

I'd like you to imagine that you've been going through a rough time. You're considering talking to a professional, maybe for some one on one counseling or maybe group counseling. In this scenario, imagine that this is something that you haven't done before so you're not really sure what type of resources are available to you. You decide to start your search on the internet.

Imagining this situation,

 - Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?
 - Where would you search?
 - What words would you use to get you this type of information?
 
 Ok, thank you for considering that. I'd like you to keep this scenario in mind for the next part.
 
 ## Task #1 - Find Individual counseling services
 



#### Scenario Set up

**Josh: This script should be updated to match a real web page, not a prototype** As I mentioned before, it's going to look like a real web page but its actually just a prototype of a website. And because it is just a prototype, it may not function quite as a normal website would.

Building on the scenario that I just gave you. Let's imagine that as you're searching, you land on a website [this prototype] that looks promising and you want to dig a little deeper to see if this website has what you need. Also, for purposes of this session, I'd like for you to imagine that you live in Orlando, Florida.

I'll give you a second to take the page in. [limit to a quick scan] **Josh: folks may naturally scan the page as screen reader users via the rotor or elements list. We'll need to give them more than a second to take it in and not make this a time-based activity**

#### TASK 1a - one-on-one


Given this scenario, imagine that you're 

- Can you tell me if that type of care or service is available here at the Orlando Vet Center?
- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of care?
- If you wanted more information what would be your next step?

[narrate what the user did]

- Tell me what's going through your mind
- If yes, 
   - How did this line up with your expectations 
- If no,    
   - Would it go by any other name?
- What could be improved about the way this information is presented?



#### Things to watch for:

- Where does the participant first click?

- Does the participant know they can expand the accordions?
 

 ## Task #2 - Understanding alternative locations

For the next task I'd like for you to imagine that you say you're curious to know if the Orlando Vet Center has other locations.

- What would your guess be based on the information provided?
- Talk me through where you would expect to see that type of information?

[Prompt user to navigate to the locations page if user has not navigated on their own]

- In your own words, how would you describe the relationship between...

 ## Task #3 - Navigating back to main

Let's imagine that you're interested in one of the services at the main location. 

**Prompt:**  Go ahead and navigate to the main page for me.

#### Things to watch for:

• How does the participant navigate? Back button, breadcrumb, Linked location name?

**Ready to visit?**

Imagining that you're interested in one of the services at this location:

- What would be your next step?

 

## General website questions

We're almost done. I just have a few more questions left.

 - In your own words, how would you describe 
 
## Task #4 - Navigating to VA.gov

Lastly, let's imagine that you wanted to look up some other information on VA.gov's homepage.

- How would you do that?

#### Things to watch for:
• 
 
## Post-Task Interview

Those are all the questions that I had for you today. 

- Do you have any questions for me or is there anything else that you think that I should know?


## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
