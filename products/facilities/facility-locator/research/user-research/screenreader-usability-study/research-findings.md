## Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to establish foundational knowledge of Veterans' Facility Locator search experience while using assistive technology on desktop and mobile devices. Understanding how Veterans, with low to no vision, who use keyboard, voice and/or other assistive technology, to try to complete facility search tasks will help us plan future product improvements so that all Veterans can easily perform a search and consume results.

## Methodology
We conducted two hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on June 8-17, 2021. Participants were asked about their assistive technology usage, how they perform location search tasks online, and were given some common Veteran location search tasks to accomplish using their preferred method, VA.gov homepage and Facility Locator. 

## Research Questions
- What assistive technologies are Veterans using?
- How does a Veteran, using assistive technology:
  - find location information online, for a place that they need to visit physically?
  - find location information using VA.gov?
  - find location information using Facility Locator?
- For Veterans using assistive technology:
  - How do mobile vs desktop experiences differ?
  - What features are useful or not useful?
  - What are the pain points?
- Does Facility Locator need to change or evolve in order to offer an equitable experience to Veterans using assistive technology?

## Who we talked to

We talked to **7 Veterans:** 

Participant demographics:
- Education: Some college (3), Associate's degree (1), Bachelor's degree (1), Master's degree (1), Doctorate degree (1)
- Geographic location: Urban (4), Rural (3)
- Ages: 55+ (6), 35-44 (1)
- Female: 2 
- Cognitive disability: (1)
 
### Underserved groups in research
![MVS-checker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4960080/125621453-2dd373d2-d126-4f50-bd21-5d6d44f7bf1a.png)

This research may not meet the needs of the following underserved Veteran communities, as the focus was primarily on recruiting Veterans with assistive technologies: Veterans with cognitive disabilities (only 1 Veteran disclosed having a learning disability, Veterans with other than honorable discharge, Veterans with immigrant origins, Latinx, Biracial, Asian, and Native Veterans, LGBTQ+ Veterans.

## Level of vision and assistive technology used:
Participants in this study had differing levels of vision, unique combinations of devices and assistive technology and displayed varying degrees of experience using their assistive technologies.

P# | LEVEL OF VISION | DEVICE | ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY |EXPERIENCE LEVEL
---|-----------------|--------|------------------------|--------------
P1 | Completely blind | Desktop | JAWS screen reader † | Advanced
P2 | Completely blind | Desktop | JAWS screen reader §† | Advanced
P4 | Cognitive Disability,  Dyslexia | mobile iPhone | iOS dictation §† | Beginner
P6 | Low vision | mobile iPhone | magic keyboard § | Beginner on iOS
P7 | Completely blind | Desktop | JAWS screen reader | Advanced
P9 | Low vision | Desktop | ZoomText screen reader ¶ | Intermediate
P10 | Low vision | Desktop | Fusion (JAWS + ZoomText) ¶ | Beginner


### Technical limitations

Due to various technical issues, not all participants were able to share their typical or preferred combination of assistive technologies in their entirety via Zoom. Therefore, some aspects were not able to be observed by the researchers during testing. Technologies not observed during testing are noted in the table above as follows:

- § Audio not shared during testing
- † Video not shared during testing
- ¶ Other assistive tech not observable during testing

Magnification software was not able to be observed during testing. More research is required to understand this type of assistive technology.

Technical limitations also prevented testing with Veterans who use switch devices and braille readers as captured in the recruitment checker.

## Hypotheses

### Using Facility Locator and assistive technology:
#### Veterans can easily perform a search.

**LIKELY UNTRUE:** Even when participants were able to successfully complete a search, it was not easy. Most expressed dissatisfaction with the experience, confusion with terms used and usability issues with some of the interactions encountered. 
 
#### Veterans can easily consume results.

**LIKELY UNTRUE:** Results listings are perceived inconsistently across users of different assistive technologies. Many key features and information were missed by screen readers, making the experience confusing for many.
 
## Key Insights
### Findings section 1 - Navigation Assistive Technology
As a Veteran who uses assistive technology, orienting myself on websites is often unpredictable, cumbersome and time-consuming

- 1.1 - I need to have multiple ways to accomplish online tasks but have my preferences
- 1.2 - I keep my desktop clean to not confuse my screen reader
- 1.3 - I make my viewport small so I may get a mobile experience on desktop
- 1.4 - I am new at using Siri but want to keep learning new ways of dictating my needs
- 1.5 - It’s easy for me to make spelling mistakes

### Findings section 2 - Online search behavior
When I look for location information for a place that I need to visit physically, I use my search engine either by dictating or typing in my search parameters…

- 2.1 - I already know my VA so I would likely only do this for unfamiliar locations
- 2.2 - I prefer to dictate location searches on my phone because it’s quicker and easier
- 2.3 - I use JAWS on my desktop for more complex searches or tasks
- 2.4 - Search engine results info is usually all I need, next I call or get directions
- 2.5 - I trust a search engine result when I hear VA.gov is the source
- 2.6 - I wish I could see hours and services of VA facilities on Google search results
- 2.7 - Sometimes I do see hours but they don’t make sense to me

### Findings section 3 - Using VA.gov
When I search for things on VA.gov, I have trouble finding what I am looking for... 
- 3.1 - The homepage is difficult to navigate and I can’t orient myself easily 
- 3.2 - Global searches don’t produce relevant results
- 3.3 - I get routed to too many different pages
- 3.4 - If I find something useful, I don’t know how to retrace my steps later
- 3.5 - I encounter too much information and I get overwhelmed
- 3.6 - Location searches [teamsite] result in a list that I have to Google individually

### Findings section 4 - Facility Locator searches
I didn’t know Facility Locator existed, but now that I do, I encounter some obstacles that would deter me from wanting to use this tool for searching…
- 4.1 - There are too many things to listen to before I can start my search
- 4.2 - There are too many requirements to fill in
- 4.3 - I don’t know what the requirements mean
- 4.4 - I didn’t put in the right requirements, so it tells me there’s an error
- 4.5 - I want to choose by something that I’m familiar with, like clinics or hospitals
- 4.6 - The service type combo box doesn’t work
- 4.7 - If I’m in a crisis, I won’t want to struggle with this page
- 4.8 - I prefer to just enter searches into one simple search box

### Findings section 5 - Facility Locator results
Consuming Facility Locator search results was also tricky…

- 5.1 - I did a search but the screen reader didn’t tell me that there weren’t results
- 5.2 - I got results but I don’t know what the letter and number combination means
- 5.3 - I don’t hear a way to get directions to these locations
- 5.4 - It not clear to me what is a phone number or other piece of information
- 5.5 - I don’t know what ‘limited services and hours means’
- 5.6 - I didn’t realize that I was being taken to Google Maps, I like to know this
- 5.7 - If I leave VA.gov I expect to go to a different tab, otherwise don’t open a new tab
- 5.8 - I didn’t see a map but I usually don’t use them because they aren’t accessible

## Recommendations
Overall, some things that would improve my experience would be to…
1. Establish a page hierarchy for pages and ensure that top navigation methods follow it 
2. Tell me what a page is about with a clear heading 1 level when navigating between pages
3. Group links and content with logically ordered  heading levels to create an understandable hierarchy of the page
4. Create regions on every page so that I can navigate quickly between areas
5. Make sure ‘skip to content’ takes me to the main content on the page
6. Give me an edit box that is easy to find because I like an easy way to search
7. Provide the purpose and destination in link text  so that I know what to expect when I click on a link
8. Name buttons and links with the keywords that I’m likely to search for like ‘menu’, ‘locations’.
9. Name states of components with descriptions like ‘menu open’ so I don’t waste time listening for clues of what just happened
10. Don’t make me know how to spell things
