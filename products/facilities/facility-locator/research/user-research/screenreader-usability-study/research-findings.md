## About the research

### Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to establish foundational knowledge of Veterans' Facility Locator search experience while using assistive technology on desktop and mobile devices. Understanding how Veterans, with low to no vision, who use keyboard, voice and/or other assistive technology, to try to complete facility search tasks will help us plan future product improvements so that all Veterans can easily perform a search and consume results.

### Methodology
We conducted two hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on June 8-17, 2021. Participants were asked about their assistive technology usage, how they perform location search tasks online, and were given some common Veteran location search tasks to accomplish using their preferred method, VA.gov homepage and Facility Locator. 

### Research Questions
- What assistive technologies are Veterans using?
- How does a Veteran, using assistive technology:
  - find location information online, for a place that they need to visit physically?
  - find location information using VA.gov?
  - find location information using Facility Locator?
- For Veterans using assistive technology:
  - How do mobile vs desktop experiences differ?
  - What features are useful or not useful?
  - What are the pain points?
- Does Facility Locator need to change or evolve in order to offer an equitable experience to Veterans using assistive technology?

### Who we talked to

We talked to **7 Veterans:** 

Participant demographics:
- Education: Some college (3), Associate's degree (1), Bachelor's degree (1), Master's degree (1), Doctorate degree (1)
- Geographic location: Urban (4), Rural (3)
- People of color: Black (3)
- Ages: 55+ (6), 35-44 (1)
- Female: 2 
- Cognitive disability: (1)
 
#### Underserved groups in research
![MVS-checker](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4960080/125621453-2dd373d2-d126-4f50-bd21-5d6d44f7bf1a.png)

This research may not meet the needs of the following underserved Veteran communities, as the focus was primarily on recruiting Veterans with assistive technologies: Veterans with cognitive disabilities (only 1 Veteran disclosed having a learning disability, Veterans with other than honorable discharge, Veterans with immigrant origins, Latinx, Biracial, Asian, and Native Veterans, LGBTQ+ Veterans.

### Level of vision and assistive technology used:
Participants in this study had differing levels of vision, unique combinations of devices and assistive technology and displayed varying degrees of experience using their assistive technologies.

P# | LEVEL OF VISION | DEVICE | ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY |EXPERIENCE LEVEL
---|-----------------|--------|------------------------|--------------
P1 | Completely blind | Desktop | JAWS screen reader † | Advanced
P2 | Completely blind | Desktop | JAWS screen reader §† | Advanced
P4 | Cognitive Disability,  Dyslexia | mobile iPhone | iOS dictation §† | Beginner
P6 | Low vision | mobile iPhone | magic keyboard § | Beginner on iOS
P7 | Completely blind | Desktop | JAWS screen reader | Advanced
P9 | Low vision | Desktop | ZoomText screen reader ¶ | Intermediate
P10 | Low vision | Desktop | Fusion (JAWS + ZoomText) ¶ | Beginner


### Technical limitations

Due to various technical issues, not all participants were able to share their typical or preferred combination of assistive technologies in their entirety via Zoom. Therefore, some aspects were not able to be observed by the researchers during testing. Technologies not observed during testing are noted in the table above as follows:

- § Audio not shared during testing
- † Video not shared during testing
- ¶ Other assistive tech not observable during testing

Magnification software was not able to be observed during testing. More research is required to understand this type of assistive technology.

Technical limitations also prevented testing with Veterans who use switch devices and braille readers as captured in the recruitment checker.

## Hypotheses

### Using Facility Locator and assistive technology:
#### Veterans can easily perform a search.

**LIKELY UNTRUE:** Even when participants were able to successfully complete a search, it was not easy. Most expressed dissatisfaction with the experience, confusion with terms used and usability issues with some of the interactions encountered. 
 
#### Veterans can easily consume results.

**LIKELY UNTRUE:** Results listings are perceived inconsistently across users of different assistive technologies. Many key features and information were missed by screen readers, making the experience confusing for many.
 
## Key Insights
### Findings section 1 - Navigation Assistive Technology
As a Veteran who uses assistive technology, orienting myself on websites is often unpredictable, cumbersome and time-consuming

- 1.1 - I need to have multiple ways to accomplish online tasks but have my preferences
- 1.2 - I keep my desktop clean to not confuse my screen reader
- 1.3 - I make my viewport small so I may get a mobile experience on desktop
- 1.4 - I am new at using Siri but want to keep learning new ways of dictating my needs
- 1.5 - It’s easy for me to make spelling mistakes

### Findings section 2 - Online search behavior
When I look for location information for a place that I need to visit physically, I use my search engine either by dictating or typing in my search parameters…

- 2.1 - I already know my VA so I would likely only do this for unfamiliar locations
- 2.2 - I prefer to dictate location searches on my phone because it’s quicker and easier
- 2.3 - I use JAWS on my desktop for more complex searches or tasks
- 2.4 - Search engine results info is usually all I need, next I call or get directions
- 2.5 - I trust a search engine result when I hear VA.gov is the source
- 2.6 - I wish I could see hours and services of VA facilities on Google search results
- 2.7 - Sometimes I do see hours but they don’t make sense to me

### Findings section 3 - Using VA.gov
When I search for things on VA.gov, I have trouble finding what I am looking for... 
- 3.1 - The homepage is difficult to navigate and I can’t orient myself easily 
- 3.2 - Global searches don’t produce relevant results
- 3.3 - I get routed to too many different pages
- 3.4 - If I find something useful, I don’t know how to retrace my steps later
- 3.5 - I encounter too much information and I get overwhelmed
- 3.6 - Location searches [teamsite] result in a list that I have to Google individually

### Findings section 4 - Facility Locator searches
I didn’t know Facility Locator existed, but now that I do, I encounter some obstacles that would deter me from wanting to use this tool for searching…
- 4.1 - There are too many things to listen to before I can start my search
- 4.2 - There are too many requirements to fill in
- 4.3 - I don’t know what the requirements mean
- 4.4 - I didn’t put in the right requirements, so it tells me there’s an error
- 4.5 - I want to choose by something that I’m familiar with, like clinics or hospitals
- 4.6 - The service type combo box doesn’t work
- 4.7 - If I’m in a crisis, I won’t want to struggle with this page
- 4.8 - I prefer to just enter searches into one simple search box

### Findings section 5 - Facility Locator results
Consuming Facility Locator search results was also tricky…

- 5.1 - I did a search but the screen reader didn’t tell me that there weren’t results
- 5.2 - I got results but I don’t know what the letter and number combination means
- 5.3 - I don’t hear a way to get directions to these locations
- 5.4 - It not clear to me what is a phone number or other piece of information
- 5.5 - I don’t know what ‘limited services and hours means’
- 5.6 - I didn’t realize that I was being taken to Google Maps, I like to know this
- 5.7 - If I leave VA.gov I expect to go to a different tab, otherwise don’t open a new tab
- 5.8 - I didn’t see a map but I usually don’t use them because they aren’t accessible

## Recommendations
Overall, some things that would improve my experience would be to…
1. Establish a page hierarchy for pages and ensure that top navigation methods follow it 
2. Tell me what a page is about with a clear heading 1 level when navigating between pages
3. Group links and content with logically ordered  heading levels to create an understandable hierarchy of the page
4. Create regions on every page so that I can navigate quickly between areas
5. Make sure ‘skip to content’ takes me to the main content on the page
6. Give me an edit box that is easy to find because I like an easy way to search
7. Provide the purpose and destination in link text  so that I know what to expect when I click on a link
8. Name buttons and links with the keywords that I’m likely to search for like ‘menu’, ‘locations’.
9. Name states of components with descriptions like ‘menu open’ so I don’t waste time listening for clues of what just happened
10. Don’t make me know how to spell things

## Recommendations for Facilities Team

### On Facility Locator - Short term

1. Establish a page hierarchy for Facility Locator, detail and product pages and assess how they follow this between different navigation methods
    1. All facility detail and product pages need to manage focus so that when a screen reader navigates by heading level, H1 is the first item announced.
2. Make ‘Skip to content’ link go to the page H1	
    1. On Facility Locator, Skip to content goes to the page breadcrumb which causes a screen reader user to have to manually skip over less important content before starting their search.
3. Move the COVID content and links into an alert region that can be announced as such. This will allow a screen reader to read the page more efficiently. 
4. Work with accessibility specialists to assess the location input to ensure the label and edit box combination make sense on a screen reader. For example, is the ‘Use my location’ input interrupting the expected flow for users? 
    1. Consider a new placement for ‘Use my location’
5. Service type combo box:
    1. Update the hint text to accurately describe the action a user must need to take
    2. Consolidate service type options so that selections are easier to make
    3. Consider creating subgroupings
    4. Work with accessibility specialist to assess how improvements will work with assistive technology
6. Restore results text when no results are found after a search
    1. Work with accessibility specialists to assess the appropriate type of announcement so that users are more likely to hear this information.
7. Fix “Get directions” and ‘phone’ links
    1. Work with accessibility specialists to assess the current problems with ‘Get directions’ and ‘phone’ links and propose new text, labels, and link text
8. Make listing letter and mileage improvements
    1. Work with accessibility specialists to assess the current problems with the letter and mileage combination and suggest improvements.
     - Would numbered listings be more natural to hear when announced by a screen reader?
     - Mileage could be better labeled and described by screen readers 
     - Is the placement of these elements optimal? 

### On Facility Locator - Medium term


9. Add ‘Google as the front door for Facility Locator and facility product pages’ as a use case to solve for and create an action plan.
    1. Assess keyword searches for top facility types on VA.gov and incorporate those terms into the product
     - E.g. Multiple users mentioned searching for burial and cemetery information and urgent care. Top terms could be surfaced in the page description.
    2. Start experimenting with structured content for location addresses and hours to see how changes could positively affect search engine search results
    3. Investigate how structured health data reconciles with current health taxonomy
10. Assess and incorporate keywords. Veterans don’t think to look for a facility locator and are likely to use global search when looking for a facility. Work with other teams to:
    1. Assess keyword searches for top facility types on VA.gov and incorporate those terms into global search best bets
    2. Experiment with patterns that exist within popular search tools like ‘hospitals near me’, ‘urgent care near me’ that could appear in type ahead global searches to connect users from the homepage to Facility Locator.

### On Facility Locator - Long term (Hypotheses to test)

11. Reassess what is the most important information to deliver on Facility locator. Veterans in this study, who use assistive technology, expressed similar information preferences as those who don’t use assistive technology as observed in past studies. In fact, this study just highlighted the need to deliver the most important information as efficiently as possible as problems experienced by sighted users are felt even more acutely by those using assistive tech. Consider improvements that would help all users.
    1. Is a map delivering value to Veterans? Veterans use other means to map directions later in their decision-making journey and it is unlikely that they would come to Facility Locator to do that. Could the mileage data point and ‘Get directions’ be enough without displaying a map or perhaps reducing its screen allocation (e.g. ⅓  vertical strip like Yelp or AirBnb)? If so, part or all of this real estate could be better allocated to information that would be more useful to Veterans when comparing between facilities.
    2. List hours over facility status alerts. An alert like ‘Limited hours and services’ does not provide enough information to help a Veteran choose a facility and instead compels a Veteran to call. Knowing a facility's operating hours would. 
    3. Does it have an ER with 24/7 care? This should be a data point that gets surfaced when available.
    4. Services; how might we display just enough service information to give Veterans a quick understanding of the type of facility to answer, “is this just a little clinic?”
    5. Assess repeated links that don’t provide facility specific information. We learned how important it is to reduce the number of elements that a user has to hear.  
     - Consider a different way to provide access to general benefit information

12. Redesign search. Veterans want an easier way to search. In this study, participants didn’t want to mess with all the “requirements” and their expectations were heavily influenced by their search engine searches. 
    1. Consider a set of exposed filters in a left rail with default selections in place so that users only have to enter in their location 
    2. Reassess the language used on Facility Locator. ‘Facility type’ and ‘Service type’ were not easily understood and it annoyed users to have to parse their meaning.
13. Give Veterans a way to quickly assess facilities at a glance. When Veterans search for VAs for long term planning like for travel or moving they are cognizant of the stark variations between size and scope of facilities across the country but they have no way of distinguishing them easily. For example, they want to know when a facility is a small clinic with limited services, if they can use it for their common primary care needs, or if there is 24/7 ER availability which is crucial in an emergency situation.
    1. Consider creating meaningful tags, or categories to assign to facilities. 
    2. Consider creating a key with explanations for terms that may be confusing or link to another page for more information.
14. Improve discoverability of facility information available to them. Veterans are unaware of the different facility types that they can find using Facility Locator. Consider a more discoverable way of browsing. 
    1. For example, a set of exposed filters in a left rail could surface facility types, like cemeteries, that might be unknown but useful to more Veterans. Two Veterans in this study described recent searches for burial and cemetery information.
