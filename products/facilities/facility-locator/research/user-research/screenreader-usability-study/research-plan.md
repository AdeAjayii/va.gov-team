# Facility Locator Screenreader Usability Study 
## Research Plan - Draft
#### April 2021 Discovery 

Background 

The Facilities team wants the Facility Locator to be easy to use with assistive technology so the search experience is an equitable experience for all Veterans. Recent changes have been made to resolve accessibility defects and implement two new usability features ("find my location" and "clear field"). 

## Goals

- Establish foundational knowledge of Veterans Facility Locator search experience while using assistive technology on desktop and mobile
- Understand how industry standards impact Veteran search experience expectations
- Understand how search experience expectations might differ on mobile vs desktop
- Identify pain points for Veterans using assistive tech to search for facilities
- Validate recent keyboard navigation and voiceover changes
 
## Research Questions 

Can Veterans, with low to no vision, who use keyboard, voice and/or other assistive technology, successfully complete facility search tasks?

- Do they have access to all functionality?
- Can they distinguish the interactive elements?
- What are the pain points?

#### Search box

- Is the search box easy to navigate? 
  - (Forward and back, no keyboard traps)
- How could the typeahead search field be improved? 
  - (Facility type = Community care providers)
- Do they understand how to enable their location?
- Do they understand how to clear inputs?
- Do error messages provide adequate support? 
  - (in particular, when searches return no results due to the radius limit)

#### Map

- Do they want to interact with the map?
  - If so, can they interact with the map easily?
- Are the context changes clearly communicated?
- Do the pins provide adequate information about the location?
- Can the map be navigated in a logical order?

#### Search results

- How many results are expected?
- For searches with a high number of results (ie: community pharmacy), is the number of tab stops/information presented appropriately?
- Are results presented in logical reading order?
- Can the result list be navigated in a logical order?
- Can the Veteran navigate easily between the results and map?
- Do Veterans using assistive tech on a mobile device prefer to view results on the map or in a list?
- Does the information presented for a given facility match expectations?
- Does the Veteran understand how to find more detailed information about the facilities returned?
- What online maps/searches do these participants find easiest to use/why?

## Method 

Sessions will combine: 

- Directed interviewing to understand participant's context and experience with assistive technology and other websites that they use currently
- Usability testing with task analysis of searches conducted on Google and Facility locator.
- 1-hour sessions will be remotely moderated via Zoom.
- Participants will share their phone or desktop screen.
