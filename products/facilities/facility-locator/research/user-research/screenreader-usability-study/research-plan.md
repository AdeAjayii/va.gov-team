# Facility Locator Screenreader Usability Study 
## Research Plan
#### May 2021 Discovery 

Background 

The Facilities team wants the Facility Locator to be easy to use with assistive technology so the search experience is an equitable experience for all Veterans. Recent changes have been made to resolve accessibility defects and implement two new usability features ("find my location" and "clear field"). 

## Goals

- Establish foundational knowledge of Veterans Facility Locator search experience while using assistive technology on desktop and mobile
- Understand how industry standards impact Veteran search experience expectations
- Understand how search experience expectations might differ on mobile vs desktop
- Identify pain points for Veterans using assistive tech to search for facilities
- Validate recent keyboard navigation and voiceover changes
 
## Research Questions 

Can Veterans, with low to no vision, who use keyboard, voice and/or other assistive technology, successfully complete facility search tasks?

- Do they have access to all functionality?
- Can they distinguish the interactive elements?
- What are the pain points?

#### Search box

- Is the search box easy to navigate? 
  - (Forward and back, no keyboard traps)
- How could the typeahead search field be improved? 
  - (Facility type = Community care providers)
- Do they understand how to enable their location?
- Do they understand how to clear inputs?
- Do error messages provide adequate support? 
  - (in particular, when searches return no results due to the radius limit)

#### Map

- Do they want to interact with the map?
  - If so, can they interact with the map easily?
- Are the context changes clearly communicated?
- Do the pins provide adequate information about the location?
- Can the map be navigated in a logical order?

#### Search results

- How many results are expected?
- For searches with a high number of results (ie: community pharmacy), is the number of tab stops/information presented appropriately?
- Are results presented in logical reading order?
- Can the result list be navigated in a logical order?
- Can the Veteran navigate easily between the results and map?
- Do Veterans using assistive tech on a mobile device prefer to view results on the map or in a list?
- Does the information presented for a given facility match expectations?
- Does the Veteran understand how to find more detailed information about the facilities returned?
- What online maps/searches do these participants find easiest to use/why?

## Method 

Sessions will combine: 

- Directed interviewing to understand participant's context and experience with assistive technology and other websites that they use currently
- Usability testing with task analysis of searches conducted on Google and Facility locator.
- 1-hour sessions will be remotely moderated via Zoom.
- Participants will share their phone or desktop screen. 


## Participants and Recruitment 

- We will utilize the Perigean contract for recruiting and notetaking.
- We'd like to schedule 16 participants to reach our goal of observing 7-10 participants.

### Primary participant criteria:

**MUST:** 

(All) Participants must:

- Primarily use a screen reader to interact with websites as specified by the following:
  - Built-in voice over provided by mobile phone, tablet or desktop computer device
  - 1 JAWS user
  - 1 NVDA user
  - 1 TalkBack (Android) user
 
[**Note for Perigean:** ]
 - Please ask participant what screen reader technology they will use for the session and include in participant tracker
 - Please get participant acknowledgement that there may be up to 4 off-camera, observers present during the research session, including the facilitator. 

AND

- Have the low to no vision as specified by the following
  - At least 4 participants have an acquired vision-related disability
  - At least 1 participant has a congenital vision-related disability
  - At least 1 participant has low vision (not complete blindness)
  - (4) Participants must have a mobile phone device and be willing to be complete the test on said device

**Definition of low vision:**  For purposes of this study we define low vision to mean ranging from having a small amount of functional vision e.g. the ability to see a box on the screen to being being what is referred to in the blindness community as "high partial," which is legally blind but having considerable usable vision, maybe they are a user of screen magnification software and only use a cane at night. 

#### Technical requirements

[**Note for Perigean:** ]
 - Please ensure participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
 - Please ensure participants are willing and prepared to screenshare

### Secondary criteria / would like to have -

At least:

- 2 females
- 2 participant of color
- 1 participant 35 or under
- 1 participant 36 - 45
- 1 participant 46 - 55

- 1 participant that does not have a college degree
- 1 participants living in a rural or remote area
- 1 participant living in a major metropolitan area
- 1 participant living in an urban area
