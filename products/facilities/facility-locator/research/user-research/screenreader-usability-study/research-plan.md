# Facility Locator - Screen reader, Usability Test
## Research Plan - May 2021 Discovery 

#### Background 

The Facilities team wants the Facility Locator to be easy to use with assistive technology so the search experience is an equitable experience for all Veterans. Recent changes have been made to resolve accessibility defects and implement two new usability features ("find my location" and "clear field"). 

## Goals

- Establish foundational knowledge of Veterans Facility Locator search experience while using assistive technology
- Understand how search experience expectations might differ on mobile vs desktop
- Identify pain points for Veterans using assistive tech to search for facilities
- Validate recent keyboard navigation and voiceover changes
 
## Research Questions 

- Can Veterans, with low to no vision, who use keyboard, voice and/or other assistive technology, successfully complete facility search tasks?
  - Can they easily perform a search?
  - Can they easily consume results?
  - Does Facility Locator need to be change or evolve to offer an equitable experience? If so, how?
  

## Method 

Sessions will combine: 

- Directed interviewing to understand participant's context, experience with assistive technology and other websites that they use currently.
- Usability testing with task analysis of searches conducted on Facility locator and their preferred search tool.
- 2 hour sessions will be remotely moderated via Zoom. Extended session length allows for technical difficulties and more time consuming task completion via screen reader.
- Participants will share their device's screen. 


## Participants and Recruitment 

- We will utilize the Perigean contract for recruiting and notetaking.
- We'd like to schedule 16 participants to reach our goal of observing 7-10 participants.

### Primary participant criteria:

**MUST:** 

(All) Participants must:

- Primarily use a screen reader to interact with websites as specified by the following:
  - 1 VoiceOver macbook or mac user
  - 1 VoiceOver iPhone or iPad user
  - 1 JAWS user
  - 1 NVDA user
  - 1 TalkBack (Android) user

AND

- Have the low to no vision as specified by the following
  - At least 4 participants have an acquired vision-related disability
  - At least 1 advanced screen reader user and 1 beginner screen reader user
  - At least 1 participant has a congenital vision-related disability
  - At least 1 participant has low vision (not complete blindness)
  - (4) Participants must have a mobile phone device and be willing to be complete the test on said device

**Definition of low vision:**  For purposes of this study we define low vision to mean ranging from having a small amount of functional vision e.g. the ability to see a box on the screen to being being what is referred to in the blindness community as "high partial," which is legally blind but having considerable usable vision, maybe they are a user of screen magnification software and only use a cane at night. 

#### Technical requirements

[**Note for Perigean:** ]
 - Ensure participant has a working screen that can be shared
 - Please ensure participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
 - Please ensure participants are willing and prepared to screenshare

### Secondary criteria / would like to have -

At least: 

- 4 participants over the age of 56
- 4 participants with a cognitive disability
- 2 participants of color
