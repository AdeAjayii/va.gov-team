### Improving VA.gov for Blind Veterans

## Email body:

Hello [Name],

 

I’m a website designer and researcher working as part of the Digital Services team at the VA.  We have multiple teams working on different sections of VA.gov and work with Veterans every day to make sure we’re always improving the website experience for them. Currently, **we are looking for blind and low vision Veterans** who would like to participate in our research studies. We’d like your help in letting Veterans know that this opportunity exists. This is a [recent video that talks about our general process](https://govmatters.tv/the-department-of-veterans-affairs-is-optimizing-its-services-with-human-centered-design/?noamp=available) for making website improvements.

Research sessions are typically conducted over Zoom where participants test out prototypes or different areas of VA.gov and Veterans give us feedback on how we can improve the pages to make them work better for them. Veterans receive a thank-you gift for their time.
 
Interested Veterans can register by phone. Additional information about the studies can be provided to circulate as you help us connect with blind Veterans. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

**Can you help?**

 

Sincerely,

 [name/contact info]
