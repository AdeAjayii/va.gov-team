# Benefits Taxonomy Conversation Guide

[Not Reviewed by Lauren Alexanderson, Subject Matter expert research not subject to review]

## For note takers

Complete verbatim transcripts may not be necessary for this study. The SME Participants will be sharing a variety of unstructured information during the conversations that may be useful. This includes:

- Missing services or context around the listed benefits
- Attitudes that veterans and caregivers have when interacting with the services
- Follow-up resources or contacts for the team

This information can be captured in short-form during the interviews, expanded upon via check-ins, and detailed from recordings during synthesis.

## Intro [5 minutes]

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Nick, I'm a designer working on the VA.gov site, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today you are helping us simplify how Veterans find services on the VA.gov site. 

- **Do you have any questions before we get started?**

Before we get to the tasks you are helping us with today, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session is scheduled for 1 hour, but it may not take that long**.
- **There is no need to turn on your camera - if you perfer, audio only is fine**
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions**. 
  - We are not testing you, or your ability, instead, we are finding out if the website meets your needs. 
  - You cannot do anything wrong. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
  - We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - [If yes]: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
  - [If no]: Alright, I will be writing or typing notes as we go.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

** **START RECORDING TO THE CLOUD** **

* **I have started recording.** 
  - I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"

## Closing [5 minutes]

### Post-research follow-up questions

- Is there anything else that you would like to point out, having gone through these exercises?
- Could we describe any of these services or categories more clearly?

### Thank you and closing

Thank you! Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Lastly, if you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session, our team can send you an email with a little description that you can pass along.

Thank you again, and enjoy the rest of your day.
