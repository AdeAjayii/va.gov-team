# Initiative Brief: Facility Locator online scheduling 
#### Overview
Online scheduling is available for _some_ Veterans at _some_ VA health facilities for _some_ VA health services. By incorporating online scheduling availability into the displayed facility information, we can make it possible for Veterans to smoothly link to the online scheduling tool (VAOS) from locations in their search results. 

As an unauthenicated experience, the Facility Locator cannot provide the most complete set of services available for online scheduling for a particular Veteran. However, new mandates are making some services (such as primary care and metnal health care) available for online scheduling by all Veterans.

## Problem
* **What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?** 
    * Many Veterans would prefer to schedule VA health appointments using online scheduling. 

* **How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?**
    * OCTO-DE objective: Provide accurate health service information for local facilities 
    * OCTO-DE objective: Help Veterans manage their health services online

### Hypotheses

## Desired User Outcomes
* Veterans can see which VA health facilities offer online scheduling for the service they searched and smoothly connect to onlilne scheduling from Facility Locator search results. 

## Undesired User Outcomes
* Veterans are sent to the online scheduling tool for services they are unable to schedule online. 

## Desired Business Outcomes
* Enabling online scheduling could also improve facility phone queue volume, improving the experience for Veterans who may be calling with more pressing needs.

## Undesired Business Outcomes
* Unintended negative impacts on VA online scheduling tool.
* Unintended negative impact on provider schedules (caused by Veterans self-scheduling unnecessary appointments)

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks.*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
    - This value is established by the prioritization and effort already applied to the VA Onling Scheduling tool. 
    - According to the VAOS DOMO Dashboard, Veterans initiate an average of 20-25K online scheduling events weekly. Scheduling competion during the month of September was 54% (exceeding their KPI success rate of 50%). 

- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
    - The Facility Locator already has the ability to display local specific service information with actionable links in search results. Usage metrics for COVID-19 vaccine services and benefit pages for community urgent care and emergency care do not demonstrate any concerns about usability. 
    - Usability can be maximized by determining the best url for connecting between Facility Locator and VAOS and communicating facility and service information so it can be prepopulated  in scheduling system on Veteran's behalf. 
    - Any other usability challenges should have already been recognized and/or mitigated by the team for the VA Online Scheduling tool. 
    
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
    - Identification of which services are broadly available 
    - Identifying best system to use as single source of truth

- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
