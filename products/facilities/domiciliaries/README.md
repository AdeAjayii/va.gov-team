## Domiciliaries

Domiciliaries are "shelters" providing services to homeless Veterans (or to returning service members who may not have a home in the area to which they have returned). They can also provide shelter to rehab patients or victims of domestic violence.

There are currently 5 locations in dual-state status:
- [Philadelphia, PA](https://www.va.gov/philadelphia-health-care/locations/)
  - [Corporal Michael J. Crescenz VAMC](https://www.philadelphia.va.gov/services/homeless/index.asp)
- Eastern Colorado (2 locations)
  - [Valor Point VA Domiciliary](https://www.denver.va.gov/locations/Valor_Point_VA_Domiciliary.asp)
  - [Denver VA Domiciliary](https://www.denver.va.gov/locations/Denver_VA_Domiciliary.asp)
- [Houston, TX](https://www.va.gov/houston-health-care/locations/houston-va-domiciliary/)
  - *(Location is currently under construction)*
- [Jackson, MS](https://www.va.gov/jackson-health-care/locations/)

Before we can reimagine detail pages or validate potential designs with Veterans, we need to better understand these facilities.
