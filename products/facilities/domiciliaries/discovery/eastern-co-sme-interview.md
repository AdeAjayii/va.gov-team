**Title:** Section Chief; clinical psychologist for Eastern CO domiciliary system

**Location(s):**
- [Denver VA Domiciliary](https://www.va.gov/eastern-colorado-health-care/locations/denver-va-domiciliary/)
- [Valor Point VA Domiciliary](https://www.va.gov/eastern-colorado-health-care/locations/valor-point-va-domiciliary/)

### Discovery Questions

- **The facility**
     - How would you describe the primary purpose of the facility?
     - Is the facility free-standing, or located inside another building (like a floor or wing of the building)?
     - Who is this facility most likely to serve, in terms of demographics?
     - Is the facility mixed gender?
     - Domiciliaries are currently categorized under "VA Homeless Programs" - we're worried that the term "homeless" may not be appropriate. Is there another term you would prefer (i.e. "unhoused", "houseless")?
     - Is there anything a Veteran with physical limitations would need to know about this facility?
     - Who normally contacts you to find out about your available services (Veterans,caregivers)?
          - How do they normally find out about you (online, through other Veterans, phone)?
          - Who do you believe would search for information about your facility online (Veterans, caregivers, etc)?
     - What term do you use to describe your facility (i.e. officially it's "domiciliary" but is another commonly used)?
          - What terms to people staying at the facility use to describe it?
- **Services**
     - What services are provided at your location?
     - Is there healthcare provided on site? (If so, what?)
     - Are there any healthcare personnel on staff?
     - Are there any other specific services provided on site (i.e. social work case management)?
     - Are there any services that Veterans often request, that are not currently offered?
- **Referrals**
     - Is there a referral process? (If so, what?)
     - Can Veterans self-refer?
     - Are walk-ins accepted?
- **Required information**
     - Are there any specific eligibility requirements for this facility?
     - What would a Veteran need to know before coming to the facility?
     - What information does a Veteran need to provide, or have with them, in order to stay there?
     - Under a "prepare for your stay" section of this facility's website, what would be meaningful to include?

### Transcript

- [Nick] Have you taken a look at how the facilities in the Eastern CO region are represented on the VA site any time recently?
> It has been a long time since I've looked, and I just know, we've heard feedback that we've gotten from Veterans over and over, is that you guys need to do a better job at present, and we agree with them but haven't been able to make that a priority.
- [Nick showing site pages, explaining Valor Point has no info]
- [Dave gives more context and explains what we're trying to accomplish; improve the web presence of VAMC facilities that are not explicitly medical centers; location and contact information we get from VAST system; health services offered are linked to an official taxonomy of about 90 services; overall page pattern is what we use for other hospitals/clinics; trying to understand what domiciliaries are, how/why they provide services, etc. to iterate on current page design to make more discoverable and to better align with Veteran needs]
