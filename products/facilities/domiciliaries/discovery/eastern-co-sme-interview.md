**Title:** Section Chief; clinical psychologist for Eastern CO domiciliary system

**Location(s):**
- [Denver VA Domiciliary](https://www.va.gov/eastern-colorado-health-care/locations/denver-va-domiciliary/)
- [Valor Point VA Domiciliary](https://www.va.gov/eastern-colorado-health-care/locations/valor-point-va-domiciliary/)

**Notes:** Would be willing to follow up for more informational interview, evaluate design updates/prototypes

### Discovery Questions

- **The facility**
     - How would you describe the primary purpose of the facility?
     - Is the facility free-standing, or located inside another building (like a floor or wing of the building)?
     - Who is this facility most likely to serve, in terms of demographics?
     - Is the facility mixed gender?
     - Domiciliaries are currently categorized under "VA Homeless Programs" - we're worried that the term "homeless" may not be appropriate. Is there another term you would prefer (i.e. "unhoused", "houseless")?
     - Is there anything a Veteran with physical limitations would need to know about this facility?
     - Who normally contacts you to find out about your available services (Veterans,caregivers)?
          - How do they normally find out about you (online, through other Veterans, phone)?
          - Who do you believe would search for information about your facility online (Veterans, caregivers, etc)?
     - What term do you use to describe your facility (i.e. officially it's "domiciliary" but is another commonly used)?
          - What terms to people staying at the facility use to describe it?
- **Services**
     - What services are provided at your location?
     - Is there healthcare provided on site? (If so, what?)
     - Are there any healthcare personnel on staff?
     - Are there any other specific services provided on site (i.e. social work case management)?
     - Are there any services that Veterans often request, that are not currently offered?
- **Referrals**
     - Is there a referral process? (If so, what?)
     - Can Veterans self-refer?
     - Are walk-ins accepted?
- **Required information**
     - Are there any specific eligibility requirements for this facility?
     - What would a Veteran need to know before coming to the facility?
     - What information does a Veteran need to provide, or have with them, in order to stay there?
     - Under a "prepare for your stay" section of this facility's website, what would be meaningful to include?

### Full Transcript

- [Nick] Have you taken a look at how the facilities in the Eastern CO region are represented on the VA site any time recently?
> It has been a long time since I've looked, and I just know, we've heard feedback that we've gotten from Veterans over and over, is that you guys need to do a better job at present, and we agree with them but haven't been able to make that a priority.
- [Nick showing site pages, explaining Valor Point has no info]
- [Dave gives more context and explains what we're trying to accomplish; improve the web presence of VAMC facilities that are not explicitly medical centers; location and contact information we get from VAST system; health services offered are linked to an official taxonomy of about 90 services; overall page pattern is what we use for other hospitals/clinics; trying to understand what domiciliaries are, how/why they provide services, etc. to iterate on current page design to make more discoverable and to better align with Veteran needs]
> Got it. I think I could do a couple things, one would be to give you an overview - sounds like understanding what redidential care is, what domiciliary care is, would be helpful. Why dont' we start there and then differentiate from some of the other services that offered within the medical center might be. I'm pulling up a slide that does a nice job, at least within the mental health realm, and I'll talk you through it.
> Residential is another word for domiciliary care, so within 'big' VA the ward names are called "doms", they're domiciliaries, we often refer to them as residential rehabilitation treatment programs [RRTPs], so we're guided by the directive for RRTPs. So Veterans know them as both, RRTPs or as doms. Within the eastern CO healthcare system there's the Valor Point dom that focuses on providing services to homeless Veterans, and for those residential services Veterans come in person and then they live there. It's a 24/7 site, but it's not a locked facility. [Pulls up slide]

> [Referring to slide] This is a slide showing the continuum of healthcare within VA. PC-MHI are the primary mental health clinics, that's where someone is going into their primary care appointment but has a mental health need, but are brief interventions that aren't really a formal involvement with the mental health service yet. If someone does need a referral to a more outpatient formal mental healthcare they would go to the General Mental Health clinics (those are like the BHIPs), and then someone would be assigned a mental health treatment coordinator and prescriber. If someone needs a more specialized form of mental health care (PTSD, substance abuse, etc) then they can go to Outpatient Speciality Care or spciality clinics, where the clinic has a singular focus on providing evidence-based treatments for a particular diagnosis or set of symptoms. Residential programs are a step up from that - for those Veterans for whome an outpatient course of treatment has not been successful or available. If they live in more rural areas and don't have access to outpatient specialty clinics, they might prefer or request admission to an RTP.
> 24/7 staff, locked from the outside but not from the inside. It's a voluntary unit, patients are free to come and go, but for security. Veterans have to be able to provide all of their own ADLs, we don't do bedside nursing care, people have to be independant in their activities of daily living. They have to have their substance use well enought managed so that they're not at risk for detox if they stop using. There needs to be enough stability so that people can function in a specialized treatment setting, but often these are really complex patients who have some medical comorbidities and who often psychiatric comorbidities. For instance in our PTSD RTP, it's not unusual for people to have coocurring substance use and depression, traumatic brain injury, or suicidal thoughts/attempts. [Referring to slide] And at the most extreme end of the mental health spectrum you have Inpatient treatment, and those are the locked psychiatric units. For people with imminant safetly concerns, or symptoms that aren't able to be managed outside of a locked setting.
