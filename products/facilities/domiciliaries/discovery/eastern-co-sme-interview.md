### Discovery Questions

- **The facility**
     - How would you describe the primary purpose of the facility?
     - Is the facility free-standing, or located inside another building (like a floor or wing of the building)?
     - Who is this facility most likely to serve, in terms of demographics?
     - Is the facility mixed gender?

### Full Transcript

- [Nick] Have you taken a look at how the facilities in the Eastern CO region are represented on the VA site any time recently?
> It has been a long time since I've looked, and I just know, we've heard feedback that we've gotten from Veterans over and over, is that you guys need to do a better job at present, and we agree with them but haven't been able to make that a priority.
- [Nick showing site pages, explaining Valor Point has no info]
- [Dave gives more context and explains what we're trying to accomplish; improve the web presence of VAMC facilities that are not explicitly medical centers; location and contact information we get from VAST system; health services offered are linked to an official taxonomy of about 90 services; overall page pattern is what we use for other hospitals/clinics; trying to understand what domiciliaries are, how/why they provide services, etc. to iterate on current page design to make more discoverable and to better align with Veteran needs]
> Got it. I think I could do a couple things, one would be to give you an overview - sounds like understanding what redidential care is, what domiciliary care is, would be helpful. Why dont' we start there and then differentiate from some of the other services that offered within the medical center might be. I'm pulling up a slide that does a nice job, at least within the mental health realm, and I'll talk you through it.
> Residential is another word for domiciliary care, so within 'big' VA the ward names are called "doms", they're domiciliaries, we often refer to them as residential rehabilitation treatment programs [RRTPs], so we're guided by the directive for RRTPs. So Veterans know them as both, RRTPs or as doms. Within the eastern CO healthcare system there's the Valor Point dom that focuses on providing services to homeless Veterans, and for those residential services Veterans come in person and then they live there. It's a 24/7 site, but it's not a locked facility. [Pulls up slide]

> [Referring to slide] This is a slide showing the continuum of healthcare within VA. PC-MHI are the primary mental health clinics, that's where someone is going into their primary care appointment but has a mental health need, but are brief interventions that aren't really a formal involvement with the mental health service yet. If someone does need a referral to a more outpatient formal mental healthcare they would go to the General Mental Health clinics (those are like the BHIPs), and then someone would be assigned a mental health treatment coordinator and prescriber. If someone needs a more specialized form of mental health care (PTSD, substance abuse, etc) then they can go to Outpatient Speciality Care or spciality clinics, where the clinic has a singular focus on providing evidence-based treatments for a particular diagnosis or set of symptoms. Residential programs are a step up from that - for those Veterans for whome an outpatient course of treatment has not been successful or available. If they live in more rural areas and don't have access to outpatient specialty clinics, they might prefer or request admission to an RTP.

> 24/7 staff, locked from the outside but not from the inside. It's a voluntary unit, patients are free to come and go, but for security. Veterans have to be able to provide all of their own ADLs, we don't do bedside nursing care, people have to be independant in their activities of daily living. They have to have their substance use well enought managed so that they're not at risk for detox if they stop using. There needs to be enough stability so that people can function in a specialized treatment setting, but often these are really complex patients who have some medical comorbidities and who often psychiatric comorbidities. For instance in our PTSD RTP, it's not unusual for people to have coocurring substance use and depression, traumatic brain injury, or suicidal thoughts/attempts. [Referring to slide] And at the most extreme end of the mental health spectrum you have Inpatient treatment, and those are the locked psychiatric units. For people with imminant safetly concerns, or symptoms that aren't able to be managed outside of a locked setting.
- [Michelle/Dave saying thanks for contex]
- [Michelle] I was glad to see community living centers on the slide too because that helps put that in perspective as well. Super helpful.
> Yeah, residential programs are often in this weird gray space between inpatient and outpatient, and we're often explaining to the medical center that we're neither. We're sort of both and we're sort of neither. We don't quite fit well in any of those spaces. Both, the Valor Point dom and the PTSD residential treatment program [at the Devner VAMC, I think - Nick] have a referral and a screening process. So most often Veterans can self-refer or be referred by a provider. For the homeless domiciliary they're much more likely to self-refer, or come into the homeless walk-in clinic, or be referred by a case manager. Within the PTSD program we're more likely to require them to have worked with their outpatient provider to be referred to the program. Part of that is the importance of waning to have continuity of care, for when they graduate from the PTSD program and are able to transition back into outpatient care.

> If someone is not at all connected with mental healthcare: 1) the follow up is really hard to do, and 2) we want to make sure that someone really needs a residential level of care, and if we can meet someone's treatment needs in a less restrictive way than residential, then we do that. So if someone hasn't tried a less restrictive form of treatment, then we're really going to encourage people to get engaged with an outpatient form of treatment first.
> So for the screening process: we'll do a brief chart review, then an interview with the Veteran to determine if they're meeing out admission criteria. For example in the homeless program, a Veteran either has to be homeless or at risk of homelessness, be independent and able to meet their activities of daily living (ADLs), abstain from substance use and not at be at risk of detox - some of those main point from the PTSD program - to have a military related trauma. They can also have other lifetime experience of trauma, we're aren't picky about whether symptoms are specificaly related to military trauma or not - the science isn't very good at differentiating which symptoms belong to which kinds of trauma for people with more than one.

> When someone is screened for admission, they're offered a bed date when we have one available, or we let them know if it's going to be more than 30 days we can help them find another program that might have availability, or to help them access community care if that's available. For both of the programs in the eastern CO system, for PTSD and for the homeless, there's just not a lot of programs available in the community. It's not uncommon for those [community] programs, when we can find them, to have longer wait times than what we have in-house. Following the missions act we do talk with Veterans about what their choices and options are, when they're not immediately available.

- [Nick] Are either of those facilities located within another building, like a wing or a floor?

> No, the Valor Point domiciliary is independant in it's own space in Lakewood [CO], about 15 miles from the main VAMC in Aurora [CO]. It's a leased facility operating offsite. We have a shuttle that takes people back and forth from the Valor Point dom to the main VAMC, so for medical appointments we can help get them there. For the PTSD program - we *were* open at the Clermont location [[Denve VAMC](https://www.va.gov/eastern-colorado-health-care/locations/denver-va-domiciliary/)] that you guys have on the form, and then when Covid hit we were moved out of that space so those beds could potentially be used for Covid overflow. Due to infrastructure problems we were not able to return to that building. The good news is that construction was already underway to build a new facility on the VAMC campus, it's own building, but the VAMC PTSD program remains closed pending construction of the new space.

[Nick] In general, would you say there's a more likely population that gets served at either domiciliary, in terms of demographics?

> We're more likely to see combat Veterans in the PTSD program. 2/3rds of the people in the PTSD program are OIF / OEF Vets [operation Iraqi freedom / operation enduring freedom]. About 10 percent still on active duty status, when we were open. The other 1/3rd we Veterans who had trauma that was not combat related, MST [military sexual trauma] or training accidents or things like that, also Vietnam Vets, Gulf War, or other conflicts. A younger group of people in the PTSD program. In the Valor Point dom there's a wider range of age groups, but fewer combat Veterans. 

[Nick] Are either of those facilities mixed gender?

> Yeah, when the program is open at full capacity Valor Point has 6 beds for women Veterans. The program has a strong history of treating Veterans who are non-binary or trans. There's a real open treatment community for working with Veterans. In previous PTSD program [on VAMC campus] we were only working with male Veterans, but in the new [under construction] facility, we will have 5 beds for Women Veterans too - 15 beds for men, 5 beds for women.

[Nick] Any other more appropriate terms like "unhoused" or "houseless" being used?

> I haven't heard them in use, but I like the shift. We will talk about helping people get stablely housed as one of their treatment goals, and so thinking about that kind of shift in language, rather than the person first kind of language - making that shift. So for language on a web presence I think that's a great idea.

[Nick] For either location are there permanent healthcare staff on site?

> Yeah, Valor Point has a full-time psychiatrist and a full-time primary care nurse practitioner, as well a nursing staff. There's an RN nurse manager, an assistant RN nurse manager, and one more RN. The 24/7 staff are LPNs. There's less capacity for managing high-level or urgent needs during the weekends, but during the week, any emergent medical issues that come up it's a call to a medical center. Often 911, but we're working on expanding the RN coverage to be truly 24/7, but that's a work in progress. The primary care nurse practitioner is the primary medical provider for Veterans at Valor Point. Veterans do often enter the program based on whether they've been on the street or not stablely housed, so managing health needs has not been somethin they've been able to do, so there's both some chronic concerns and some accute medical concerns, that increase the complexity of care. Often comorbid mental health psychiatric needs as well as medical needs.

[Nick] Any services that people ask for that aren't offered?

> I think some of the things that are offered within the main medical center that are just harder to get, like dental and eye exams - some of it is because people aren't elegible for those services within VA, if they're not service connected or don't meet requirements. If they're in the Valor Point dom for a certain amount of time, then they qualify for certain benefits, like dental or some vision benefits, and they can access those in the community closer to where the dom is located. Otherwise we do utilize that shuttle back and forth to the main VAMC quite a bit, so Veterans can access their goal appointments, or any other to get their needs met.

[Nick] Are there different elegibility requirements for services within the dom, or is it that once you're in you automatically qualify for a range of services?

> There are, I don't know all of them, but with dental for example, there are certain services that once you're in the program you have access to, like if you have an abscess tooth, you can get it extracted, but in terms of the more [routine, longer-term, or preventative care], unless someone is 100% service connected then I think a lot of Veterans just aren't elegible for those kinds of services within VA. And that's not unique to domiciliary populations, that's true across the board.

[Nick] So if something qualifies as an "emergency" they're maybe more likely to be taken care of?

> Yeah, absolutely. And at Valor Point because it located so far from the main VAMC - it's in a different county even - when we have to call 911, it's not the VA emeregncy department that's going to see them first, it's going to be an emergency department that's much closer. Likely Lakewood [CO] community emergency services, for either mental health or medical. If someone needs to be hospitalized, if it's appropriate, that community partner will try to get that Veteran moved from the community facility to the VA facility. Community partners will also protect Veterans from being billed inappropriately for services they have recieved.

[Nick] Is there anything a Veteran would need to know before coming to either facility? Like is there anything they need to bring with them, or...

> Yeah, for the PTSD program, that has a shorter length of stay, about 8 weeks and it's intensive trauma treatment. In the PTSD program usually we'll try to work with people to try to maintain their routine medical care, but those 8 weeks are not the time to focus on new medical issues or get ahead of their job of managing some of their chronic medical issues. We're asking them to do that either before or after the program - not always possible with the homeless dom since people are there for longer, 3-6 months, sometimes longer. [At the dom] They are usually able to get a handle on their routine medical care. What's true in both locations is that the providers on site aren't going to work to increase opiate medications - not just take them away, but work to taper down and get a safe medication regimen. It's sometimes helpful for Veterans to know you are unlikely to have increases in pain medication in a RTP. We often talk about this in our screening process just to give Veterans a heads up - they need to work with their primary care doctor for that, not dom or RTP staff.

[Nick] Is that common, do Veterans come in looking for additional medical services that they think they can get at a domiciliary that they're not already getting?

> Yeah I think so, for a number of different reasons. Sometimes when people are doing intensive trauma treatment, they're now in contact with hurt and pain that they have been trying to avoid and stay away from, so they legitimately feel worse and are looking for ways to feel better. So what we'll try to do is talk to them abou the very feal ways in which they feel worse, and how that's a part of treatment, and to see if we can use the psychotherapy and the tools and skills that they're learning to help through that period of time, knowing that it's not going to last forever, and so throwing more meds at it is not necessarily a good long-term solution for the problem. I don't think people are faking or trying to get high or illegitimate, I think it's trying to figure out what works, and in the past substances have worked. You go to what you know works.

[Nick] If you were updating the site, what the first thing you would want Veterans coming into the program to know?
