### Discovery Questions

- **The facility**
     - How would you describe the primary purpose of the facility?
     - Is the facility free-standing, or located inside another building (like a floor or wing of the building)?
     - Who is this facility most likely to serve, in terms of demographics?
     - Is the facility mixed gender?
     - Domiciliaries are currently categorized under "VA Homeless Programs" - we're worried that the term "homeless" may not be appropriate. Is there another term you would prefer (i.e. "unhoused", "houseless")?
     - Is there anything a Veteran with physical limitations would need to know about this facility?
     - Who normally contacts you to find out about your available services (Veterans,caregivers)?
          - How do they normally find out about you (online, through other Veterans, phone)?
          - Who do you believe would search for information about your facility online (Veterans, caregivers, etc)?
     - What term do you use to describe your facility (i.e. officially it's "domiciliary" but is another commonly used)?
          - What terms to people staying at the facility use to describe it?
- **Services**
     - What services are provided at your location?
     - Is there healthcare provided on site? (If so, what?)
     - Are there any healthcare personnel on staff?
     - Are there any other specific services provided on site (i.e. social work case management)?
     - Are there any services that Veterans often request, that are not currently offered?
- **Referrals**
     - Is there a referral process? (If so, what?)
     - Can Veterans self-refer?
     - Are walk-ins accepted?
- **Required information**
     - Are there any specific eligibility requirements for this facility?
     - What would a Veteran need to know before coming to the facility?
     - What information does a Veteran need to provide, or have with them, in order to stay there?
     - Under a "prepare for your stay" section of this facility's website, what would be meaningful to include?

### Transcript

- [Nick] Have you taken a look at how the facilities in the Eastern CO region are represented on the VA site any time recently?
> It has been a long time since I've looked, and I just know, we've heard feedback that we've gotten from Veterans over and over, is that you guys need to do a better job at present, and we agree with them but haven't been able to make that a priority.
- [Nick showing site pages, explaining Valor Point has no info]
- [Dave gives more context and explains what we're trying to accomplish; improve the web presence of VAMC facilities that are not explicitly medical centers; location and contact information we get from VAST system; health services offered are linked to an official taxonomy of about 90 services; overall page pattern is what we use for other hospitals/clinics; trying to understand what domiciliaries are, how/why they provide services, etc. to iterate on current page design to make more discoverable and to better align with Veteran needs]
> Got it. I think I could do a couple things, one would be to give you an overview - sounds like understanding what redidential care is, what domiciliary care is, would be helpful. Why dont' we start there and then differentiate from some of the other services that offered within the medical center might be. I'm pulling up a slide that does a nice job, at least within the mental health realm, and I'll talk you through it.
> Residential is another word for domiciliary care, so within 'big' VA the ward names are called "doms", they're domiciliaries, we often refer to them as residential rehabilitation treatment programs [RRTPs], so we're guided by the directive for RRTPs. So Veterans know them as both, RRTPs or as doms. Within the eastern CO healthcare system there's the Valor Point dom that focuses on providing services to homeless Veterans, and for those residential services Veterans come in person and then they live there. It's a 24/7 site, but it's not a locked facility.
