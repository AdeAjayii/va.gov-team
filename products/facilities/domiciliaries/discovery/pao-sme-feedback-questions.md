## Dom/CLC Prototype feedback

### PAO/SME Questions

- We want to create a template to standardize page content - what makes sense to standardize?
  - Intro paragraph
  - Admissions description
  - Hours of operation description
- Is there a distinction between regular business hours, and 24/7 health care hours?
  - ie. Residents have 24/7 access to care, but what about visiting hours, or regular business hours for non-residents?
- Are there specific phone numbers for admissions, vs health care personel, etc.?
- Is it feasible for you to create/edit this page layout?
- For different kinds of programs (dom PTSD, dom RRTP, etc.) does one overall program page make sense?

### PAO/SME Interview (9/21/21)

**SME:** Brandy Morrison (brandy.morrison2@va.gov), Eastern CO PAO

**SME:** Dr. Mandy Rabenhorst-Bell (mandy.rabenhorst-bell@va.gov), Psychologist, Eastern CO Domiciliaries

- [Mandy] If it's going to be consistant across all VA, then it makes sense to not reinvent definitions or descriptions, but borrow what's there. [Referened definitions and info contained in VHA publication [1162.02 - Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Program](https://www.va.gov/vhapublications/publications.cfm?Pub=1). Also suggested speaking to national VA leadership for MHRRTP: Deputy Director Kimberly Coleman-Prior, Deputy Director Jennifer Burden].
- [Mandy - after hearing our rational for using the program page pattern] I think that makes a lot of sense, I would be worried that having it on the locations page would encourage people just to show up, as if it was a location that folks can have same-day access, and that's just not the case with doms.
- [Mandy] Yeah those are great [referencing program page sections]. I had a chance to talk to our residential recovery workgroup, and one of the suggestions they had too was the possibility of including Veteran testimonials. Whether that was consistent across all VA RRTP or unique and therefore optional to each program. On the national center for PTSD some of their front-facing material is clips of Veterans sharing about their experience with treatment, or their symptoms of PTSD, or getting families involved in their care. There could be some benefit to hearing from Vets who've gone through an RRTP - what they liked about it, whether they found it beneficial, or whether they'd recommend it, either in general or program specific.
- [Brandy] I just want to be clear too, this is Drupal and there's not a lot of customization. We can change word content, but as far as putting images, there's a lot of restrictions in Drupal that we don't have with our current web platform.
- [Nick - I explain that the intent is just to edit content, and not really add new elements or change page structure]
- [Mandy] I think that makes sense, if Veterans are looking at the difference between the program in Denver and the one in Salt Lake city, that they would know where to look on the page for the information [as in, the page layout is standardized and doesn't change much between locations/programs].
- [Michelle - asked about testimonial: should they be video, quotes, links to video, etc. if the page can't display it directly]
- [Mandy] I think either could be useful - just words reminds me of checking out a restaurant [like a google review], you might want read the reviews. The testimonial wouldn't necessarily have to be Veterans if you're concerned about privacy, and that could be a longer term project. Just an idea.
- [Brandy] A lot of user who've used the previous platform aren't excited because Drupal just doesn't allow for some of the things that we previously had. I think the consistancy is key, because right now when you go to one VA website you've gone to one VA website and it's the same. I do think that having the ability to put a video in, over a longer period of time of testimonials, that highlight the program itself is a way to stand out on the page from just text. For future planning, a video introduction would be great - videos of the site, snippets of what people got out of the program, etc. Just something to break up the monotany of words.
- [Michelle] Video can be challenging on the page because of accessibility, but we have done things like link to Youtube videos or somewhere there's an approved video. Vet Centers has a couple things like that.
- [Mandy] Another thing for future thinking, there might be some programs that have results-type data they might be at liberty to share. Sort of like what evidence do they have that shows that the program works. Every residential program is required to engage in evidence-based care, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of their program. It isn't always something that can be disseminated, but in the future there might be a way to incorporate that outcome data.
