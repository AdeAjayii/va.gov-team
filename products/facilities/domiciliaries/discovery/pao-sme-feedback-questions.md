## Dom/CLC Prototype feedback

### PAO/SME Questions

- We want to create a template to standardize page content - what makes sense to standardize?
  - Intro paragraph
  - Admissions description
  - Hours of operation description
- Is there a distinction between regular business hours, and 24/7 health care hours?
  - ie. Residents have 24/7 access to care, but what about visiting hours, or regular business hours for non-residents?
- Are there specific phone numbers for admissions, vs health care personel, etc.?
- Is it feasible for you to create/edit this page layout?
- For different kinds of programs (dom PTSD, dom RRTP, etc.) does one overall program page make sense?
