## Dom/CLC Prototype feedback

### PAO/SME Questions

- We want to create a template to standardize page content - what makes sense to standardize?
  - Intro paragraph
  - Admissions description
  - Hours of operation description
- Is there a distinction between regular business hours, and 24/7 health care hours?
  - ie. Residents have 24/7 access to care, but what about visiting hours, or regular business hours for non-residents?
- Are there specific phone numbers for admissions, vs health care personel, etc.?
- Is it feasible for you to create/edit this page layout?
- For different kinds of programs (dom PTSD, dom RRTP, etc.) does one overall program page make sense?

### PAO/SME Interview (9/21/21)

**SME:** Dr. Mandy Rabenhorst-Bell (mandy.rabenhorst-bell@va.gov), Psychologist, Eastern CO Domiciliaries

- [Mandy] If it's going to be consistant across all VA, then it makes sense to not reinvent definitions or descriptions, but borrow what's there. [Referened definitions and info contained in VHA publication [1162.02 - Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Program](https://www.va.gov/vhapublications/publications.cfm?Pub=1). Also suggested speaking to national VA leadership for MHRRTP: Deputy Director Kimberly Coleman-Prior, Deputy Director Jennifer Burden].
- [Mandy - after hearing our rational for using the program page pattern] I think that makes a lot of sense, I would be worried that having it on the locations page would encourage people just to show up, as if it was a location that folks can have same-day access, and that's just not the case with doms.
- [Mandy] Yeah those are great [referencing program page sections]. I had a chance to talk to our residential recovery workgroup, and one of the suggestions they had too was the possibility of including Veteran testimonials. Whether that was consistent across all VA RRTP or unique and therefore optional to each program. On the national center for PTSD some of their front-facing material is clips of Veterans sharing about their experience with treatment, or their symptoms of PTSD, or getting families involved in their care. There could be some benefit to hearing from Vets who've gone through an RRTP - what they liked about it, whether they found it beneficial, or whether they'd recommend it, either in general or program specific.
