## Domiciliary Discovery Findings

### Background

[Domiciliaries](https://www.va.gov/homeless/dchv.asp) are residential shelters that provide services to homeless Veterans (or to returning service members who may not have a home in the area to which they have returned). They can also provide shelter to rehab patients, victims of domestic violence, Veterans with disabilities,  and any qualifying Veteran requiring offered services. They are often connected to VAMC facilities, and both VAMCs and [Community Resource and Referral Centers (CRRCs)](https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/CRRC.asp), can  help connect Veterans to various programs and services, including domiciliary facilities.

### Domiciliary categories

Domiciliaries fall under the [Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation Program (MHRRTP)](https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/docs/DCHV_Definitions_of_MHRRTPs.pdf) category of VA programs. Programs are basically packages of services (as explained by Lisa Trombley), and may themselves contain other programs/services.

Domiciliary facilities are mainly distinguished by the type of services they provide. Larger facilities may serve multiple populations at the same location. The official service categories are:
- Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (DRRTP or RRTP)
- Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans (DCHV)
- Domiciliary PTSD (Dom PTSD)
- Domiciliary SA (Dom SA) [substance use issues]
- Compensated Work Therapy (CWT)
- Transitional Residence (TR)

### Domiciliary site pages

Information about domiciliary locations is present on newer VA system pages, as well as legacy site pages, but the information available about facilities and services themselves is not consistent. Pages have different levels of information availability:
- No information about services
  - [Valor Point VA Domiciliary system site](https://www.va.gov/eastern-colorado-health-care/locations/valor-point-va-domiciliary/) || [Valor Point legacy site](https://www.denver.va.gov/locations/Valor_Point_VA_Domiciliary.asp)
