## Domiciliary Discovery Findings

### Background

[Domiciliaries](https://www.va.gov/homeless/dchv.asp) are residential shelters that provide services to homeless Veterans (or to returning service members who may not have a home in the area to which they have returned). They can also provide shelter to rehab patients or victims of domestic violence. They are often connected to VAMC facilities, and both VAMCs and [Community Resource and Referral Centers (CRRCs)](https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/CRRC.asp), can  help connect Veterans to various programs and services, including domiciliary facilities.

### Domiciliary categories

[Domiciliary types explained](https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/docs/DCHV_Definitions_of_MHRRTPs.pdf)

Domiciliary facilities are mainly distinguished by the type of services they provide. Larger facilities may serve multiple populations at the same location. The official categories are:
- Domiciliary Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (DRRTP or RRTP)
- Domiciliary Care for Homeless Veterans (DCHV)
- Domiciliary PTSD (Dom PTSD)
- Domiciliary SA (Dom SA)
- Compensated Work Therapy (CWT)-Transitional Residence (TR)
