Hello [NAME],

I work on the VA.gov Facilities product team, and we are preparing to make some updates to the VA health system webpages of domiciliary facilities. To make sure that we focus on the right improvements, we would like to talk with individuals who manage and work at the domiciliaries themselves.

We want to gain a more accurate understanding of the various aspects of a person's experience while staying at a domiciliary locations, including a description of the facility, information about potential services provided, and anything else that would help us to better categorize the facility.

A few of the questions we would like to ask are:

- Is the facility free-standing, or located inside another building (like a floor, or wing)?
- Who is this facility most likely to serve, in terms of demographics?
- Is there healthcare provided on site?
- Is there a referral process?

Are you available any day this or next week, from 10am - 11am eastern time, for an informal chat for us to learn more? My schedule is flexible, so if those hours don't work we can find some time that does.

Thank you for your help!
