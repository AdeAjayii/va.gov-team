# Topic Dives

## Purpose/background
The VA CMS is a vast system with many moving parts. These topic dives are meant to be shorter presentations on a specific topic within that ecosystem. If there is a topic you want covered, ask about it! Someone else is probably curious too.

## Current schedule

## How to sign up to present

## Requested future topics
Please add any potential future topics you would like covered below:
- Overview of the CMS Dashboard for Vet Center editors (and - if possible - the research for how the cards and tasks were determined)
- How does the help desk work?
- content api / accelerated publishing (when it is available)
- How do CMS teams use Task files?
- Sections: How do they work for subsections? How to they interact with roles?

- Cerner: VA health systems are undergoing a years-long transition of their Electronic Health Records systems, moving away from VistA in favor of Cerner. The Public Websites team has been tasked with managing the piece of that puzzle that involves linking an authenticated veteran to the appropriate system based on whether that veteran's health care facility has transitioned or not. KISS (Keep It Simply Static): We have a system in place to generate arbitrary static data files from CMS data. The Cerner/EHR data points making their way from Drupal to the browser is one example of this system being used.
