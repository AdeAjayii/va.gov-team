## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Chris, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding vaccination information on the VA.gov website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 60 minutes.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to make sure that vaccination information is easy to find on VA.gov. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Now I'll give you a quick overview of today's session.
- First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started.

- Then I will share my screen to show you a health services page on VA.gov. This is just to show how services are shown, before we start the main part of the session.

- After that I will send you a link to a web page. On that page, I will take you through 6 quick tasks. The goal of these tasks is for me to understand where you would most likely look for vaccine information on the page.

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

    - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    - (If no: Moderator will share screen and walk through the card sort with input from participant)

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

- Can you tell me a little about your service history?

- Have you visited the VA for healthcare in the past year?
    - If yes, can you tell me about that?
    
Great! Now I would like to ask you a few questions related to our study.

- If you were to search for vaccination-related services on the VA.gov website, what words would you use in your search?
    - As examples, would you be more likely to use the word vaccine/vaccination, or immunization, or shot?

- Have you had any vaccines in the last 10 years?


## Health Services Page - 5 minutes

So while I am sharing my screen, I want to walk through an example of how health services are shown on VA.gov. 

###### MODERATOR SHARES SCREEN OF HEALTH SERVICES PAGE
[Link to Health Services page](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/locations/pittsburgh-va-medical-center-university-drive/) --> Podiatry
This page covers the types of health services found at a VA Healthcare facility. There are several categories, and just as an example, I am showing the section on Podiatry. Each section has a description of what is treated, like arthritis, bunions, and other foot care. Below that is information on location, contact information and making appointments.
 

## Card Sort - 35 minutes
Ok, with this page in mind, I am going to send you a link, and we will go through the tasks I mentioned.

###### PARTICIPANT SHARING CARD SORT PAGE

- This page looks very different from the VA page we just visited, but imagine that we are looking at the same page, where the health services are shown on the right. 

- This is what we call a card sort. On the left hand side you will see cards with vaccines displayed on them. I will give a task for each vaccine type, and all you need to do is move the vaccine card into one of the health service boxes on the right, where you would expect to find information about that vaccine. 

 - And if none of the groups on the right seem like the best place, you can also create your own group and call it by a name that makes sense to you. You would do this by just dragging the vaccine card to the open area outside of the health services boxes.

 - Now, it looks like there are a lot of cards to move from the left side. Each type of vaccine actually comes with an extra card which is optional to use. For the most part, they are there only in case you would expect to find vaccine information in more than one place on the right. You can use the extra cards for that, but you don't have to. 

- As you sort these cards, if you could share your thoughts out loud while you work, that would be great. That will help me to follow along.

###### BEGIN CARD SORT TASKS

### Task 1 Scenario

For the first task, you are planning to get your annual Flu shot, and would like to read information on Flu shots provided by VA.gov:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would expect to find Flu shot information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Flu shot card to the right to the place where you would expect to find more information.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):

I see you've selected __. Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?</em>

In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting the Flu vaccine?

Would you search for Flu or influenza?

You mentioned that you have had the Flu shot - 
    - <em>(If yes, received vaccine) When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? Pharmacy visit? Town hall or other community-based vaccination program? <em>(Ask for each of the vaccines that the participant states having received).</em>


### Task 2 Scenario

For this second task, it has been many years since you last had a Tdap shot (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) and would like to know more about how to receive this shot:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would expect to find Tdap shot information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Tdap shot card to the right to the place where you think it makes the most sense.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):

I see you've selected __. Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?</em>

In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this shot?

Have you received the Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine / Have you received a Tdap booster?


### Task 3 Scenario

Great! I have one more task with the Tdap vaccine. It has been a few years since your last Tdap booster. In the case of a minor injury, such as a cut involving rusted metal, you would like to get a Tdap booster as quickly as possible:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would search for Tdap booster information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Tdap shot card to the right to the place where you think it makes the most sense.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):

I see you've selected __. Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?</em>

In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this shot? 
    - When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? Pharmacy visit? Town hall or other community-based vaccination program? <em>


### Task 4 Scenario

For this next task, you have many questions about the COVID-19 vaccine, its availability and where you might go to receive it:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would expect to find COVID-19 vaccine information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the COVID-19 vaccine card to the right to the place where you think it makes the most sense.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):

I see you've selected __. Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?</em>

In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this vaccine?

Would you search for Coronavirus vs COVID?



### Task 5 Scenario

For this task, you have read that it is important to get the Shingles vaccine once you have reached the age of 60. You would like to know if the VA provides this vaccine:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would expect to find Shingles vaccine information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Shingles vaccine card to the right to the place where you think it makes the most sense.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):

I see you've selected __. Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?</em>

In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting this vaccine?

Have you gotten or plan to get the shingles vaccine when you are at the age at which it is recommended?  
    - <em>(If yes, received vaccine)</em> When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? Pharmacy visit? Town hall or other community-based vaccination program? <em>


### Task 6 Scenario

For the last task, you are considering a visit to Central America, and aren't sure if there are any vaccinations you need before going:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would expect to find travel-related vaccine information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Travel-Related Vaccines card to the right to the place where you expect to find more information.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):

I see you've selected __. Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?</em>

In making that selection, what information would you expect to see about getting travel-related vaccines?
