## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Chris, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding vaccination information on the VA.gov website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to make sure that vaccination information is easy to find on VA.gov. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

I'll give you a quick overview of today's session.
- First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started.

- Then I will send you a link to a VA web page, and ask you to share your screen so that I can see what you see.

- After that I will send you a link to a second web page. On that page, I will take you through 3 quick tasks. The goal of these tasks is that I can understand where you would most likely look for vaccine information on the page.

- And then lastly, I will just ask a few follow up questions. That's it!

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

    - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    - (If no: Moderator will share screen and walk through the card sort with input from participant)

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

- Can you tell me a little about your service history?
- Have you visited the VA for healthcare in the past year?
    - If yes, can you tell me about that?

## Health Services Page - 5 minutes

I'm going to share a link to a VA web page here in the zoom chat window for you to click on. Then I'll want you to share your screen so that I can follow along and see what you see.

###### MODERATOR SHARES LINK TO PA HEALTH SERVICES PAGE
[Link to Health Services page](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/health-services/)
- Have you ever used this page? 
 - If yes, how long ago? What were you doing? What was the experience like?
 - If no, this page covers the types of health services found at a VA Healthcare facility. This is the page I would like to discuss with you today and get your feedback. In a minute, we will do some easy tasks where you can provide your thoughs on where it makse the most sense to find vaccination information on this webpage. 

## Card Sort - 15 minutes
Ok, with this page in mind, I am going to send you a second link, and we will go through the tasks I mentioned.

- This page looks very different from the VA page, but the groups of health services displayed here are the same, just on cards. 
- This is what we call a card sort. On the left hand side you will see three cards with vaccines displayed on them. I will give you a task for each of these 3 cards, and all you need to do is move the vaccine cards into one of the groups on the right, where you might expect to find information about that vaccine. And if none of the groups on the right seem like the best place, you can also create your own group.
- As you sort these cards, if you could talk out loud while you work, that would be great. That will help me to understand your thoughts.

###### BEGIN CARD SORT TASKS

    - If yes, can you tell me about that?
- Can you think of anything that would make this website easier for you to use next time?
- Is there anything that I haven't asked you that you think that I should know?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
