## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Chris, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding vaccination information on the VA.gov website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes.

- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to make sure that vaccination information is easy to find on VA.gov. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

I'll give you a quick overview of today's session.
- First, I'll ask you a few warm up questions to get us started.

- Then I will send you a link to a VA web page, and ask you to share your screen so that I can see what you see.

- After that I will send you a link to a second web page. On that page, I will take you through 4 quick tasks. The goal of these tasks is that I can understand where you would most likely look for vaccine information on the page.

- And then lastly, I will just ask a few follow up questions. That's it!

- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 

    - If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    - (If no: Moderator will share screen and walk through the card sort with input from participant)

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

- Can you tell me a little about your service history?
- Have you visited the VA for healthcare in the past year?
    - If yes, can you tell me about that?

## Health Services Page - 5 minutes

I'm going to share a link to a VA web page here in the zoom chat window for you to click on. Then I'll want you to share your screen so that I can follow along and see what you see.

###### MODERATOR SHARES LINK TO PA HEALTH SERVICES PAGE
[Link to Health Services page](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care/health-services/)
This page covers the types of health services found at a VA Healthcare facility. This is the page I would like to discuss with you today and get your feedback. In a minute, we will do some easy tasks in which you tell me where it the most sense to find vaccination information on this webpage. 

## Card Sort - 20 minutes
Ok, with this page in mind, I am going to send you a second link, and we will go through the tasks I mentioned.

- This page looks very different from the VA page, but the groups of health services displayed here are the same, just on cards. 

- This is what we call a card sort. On the left hand side you will see three cards with vaccines displayed on them. I will give you a task for each of these 3 cards, and all you need to do is move the vaccine cards into one of the groups on the right, where you might expect to find information about that vaccine. And if none of the groups on the right seem like the best place, you can also create your own group.

- As you sort these cards, if you could talk out loud while you work, that would be great. That will help me to understand your thoughts.

###### BEGIN CARD SORT TASKS

### Task 1 Scenario

For the first task, you are planning to get your annual Flu shot, and would like to read information on Flu shots provided by VA.gov:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would expect to find Flu shot information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Flu shot card to the right to the place where you think it makes the most sense.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):</em>

I see you've selected __. 
- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?

### Task 2 Scenario

For the second task, it has been many years since you last had a Tdap shot (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) and would like to know more about how to receive this shot:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would expect to find Tdap shot information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Tdap shot card to the right to the place where you think it makes the most sense.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):</em>

I see you've selected __. 
- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?

### Task 3 Scenario

For the third task, you have many questions about the COVID-19 vaccine, its availability and where you might go to receive it:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would expect to find COVID-19 vaccine information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the COVID-19 vaccine card to the right to the place where you think it makes the most sense.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):</em>

I see you've selected __. 
- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?

### Task 4 Scenario

<em>(This will only be relevant to a subset of participants who are 60 years old or older. Should we include this task for only for participants in the recommended age group?)</em>

For this task, you have read that it is important to get the Shingles vaccine once you have reached the age of 60. You would like to know if the VA provides this vaccine:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would expect to find Shingles vaccine information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Shingles vaccine card to the right to the place where you think it makes the most sense.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):</em>

I see you've selected __. 
- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?

### Task 5 Scenario

For the last task, you are considering a visit to Central America, and aren't sure if there are any vaccinations you need before going:
Can you talk me through which group on the right you would expect to find travel-related vaccine information?
- When you are ready, go ahead and move the Travel-Related Vaccines card to the right to the place where you think it makes the most sense.
    
<em>(If participant makes their choice without sharing their thought process):</em>

I see you've selected __. 
- Can talk me through why you chose this particular group (or create a new group)?


## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes

I have a few questions before we finish up:
- When you search for vaccination-related services on the VA.gov website, what words would you use in your search?
    - As examples, would you be more likely to use the word vaccine/vaccination, or immunization, or shot?
- Would you search for Flu or influenza?
- Would you search for Coronavirus vs COVID?
- Have you had any vaccines in the last 10 years?
- How many times in the last 5 years have you had the flu shot?
- (If 60 or older) Have you gotten or plan to get the shingles vaccine?
- Have you taken Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine / Have you taken Tdap booster?
- You mentioned having gotten the ___ vaccine. When you received it, was it part of a VA visit? Pharmacy visit? Town hall or other community-based vaccination program? <em>(Ask for each of the vaccines that the participant states having received).</em>
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we work to make vaccine information easy to find for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
