## Health Services - Vaccination Services Taxonomy
The Facilities and VAOS teams need better understanding of the process for searching for community care providers to inform the PPMS taxonomy work and to improve the Veteran search experience. 

## What we need to do

- Learn how we can support Veterans who search for vaccination services.

## Goals

- Learn the Veteran mental models for vaccination within the health service taxonomy, primarily for VAMCs

### Questions to Ask
- Where in the VHA taxonomy do Veterans expect vaccination services to be found?
  - For example, do they expect to find it under primary care, with pharmacy (related to "medication"), under a particular specialty; or within a taxon named "Vaccination" (or similar)?
  - What words do Veterans use when searching for vaccination-related services?
  - What words do Veterans use when searching - such as

- Vaccine/vaccination vs immunization vs shot

- Flu or influenza

- Coronavirus vs COVID

- Does the expectation change based on the type of vaccination?
  - Age-based (such as shingles or pneumococcal)
  - Risk-based (such as pneumococcal)
  - Seasonal flu
  - COVID vaccination/testing

## Method

- Treejack sort. This method will allow the participants to easily choose the location(s) within the taxonomy where they expect to find vaccination services information. 
- Using a treejack sort, multiple tasks can be given to account for real-world scenarios (e.g. annual Flu shot, COVID-19 vaccination, etc.)
