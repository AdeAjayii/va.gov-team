## Health Services - Vaccination Services Taxonomy
The Facilities needs a better understanding of how veterans expect to find health services at VA as a foundational part of improving the Veteran search experience. 

## What we need to do

- Learn how we can support Veterans who search for vaccination services at VA health care systems.

## Goals

- Learn the Veteran mental models for vaccination within the health service taxonomy, primarily for VAMCs

### Questions to be answered by research results 
- Where in the VHA service taxonomy do Veterans expect vaccination services to be found?
  - For example, do they expect to find it under primary care, with pharmacy (related to "medication"), under a particular specialty; or within a taxon named "Vaccination" (or similar)?
  - What words do Veterans use when searching for vaccination-related services?
  - What words do Veterans use when searching - such as

- Vaccine/vaccination vs immunization vs shot

- Flu or influenza

- Coronavirus vs COVID

- Does the expectation change based on the type of vaccination?
  - Age-based (such as shingles or pneumococcal)
  - Risk-based (such as pneumococcal)
  - Seasonal flu
  - Time or incident-based (such as Tdap, Tdap Boosters)
  - COVID vaccination
  - COVID testing

## Method

- Hybrid card sort. This method will allow the participants to easily choose the location(s) within the taxonomy where they expect to find vaccination services information. 
- Using a card sort, multiple tasks can be given to account for real-world scenarios (e.g. annual Flu shot, COVID-19 vaccination, etc.)

## Participants (Preliminary - in Progress)

## Recruitment Process
- Number of participants should be at least 15. 
- Researcher will work with Perigean to draft recruitment email and send out an interest email to Veterans
- Perigean sends another recruitment email (if needed)
