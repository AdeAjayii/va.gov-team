## Health Services - Vaccination Services Taxonomy
The Facilities and VAOS teams need better understanding of the process for searching for community care providers to inform the PPMS taxonomy work and to improve the Veteran search experience. 

## What we need to do

- Learn how we can support Veterans who search for vaccination services.

## Goals

- Learn the Veteran mental models for vaccination within the health service taxonomy, primarily for VAMCs

### Questions to Ask
- Where in the VHA taxonomy do Veterans expect vaccination services to be found?
  - For example, do they expect to find it under primary care, with pharmacy (related to "medication"), under a particular specialty; or within a taxon named "Vaccination" (or similar)?
  - What words do Veterans use when searching for vaccination-related services?
  - What words do Veterans use when searching - such as

- Vaccine/vaccination vs immunization vs shot

- Flu or influenza

- Coronavirus vs COVID

- Does the expectation change based on the type of vaccination?
  - Age-based (such as shingles or pneumococcal)
  - Risk-based (such as pneumococcal)
  - Seasonal flu
  - COVID vaccination/testing

## Method

- Treejack sort. This method will allow the participants to easily choose the location(s) within the taxonomy where they expect to find vaccination services information. 
- Using a treejack sort, multiple tasks can be given to account for real-world scenarios (e.g. annual Flu shot, COVID-19 vaccination, etc.)

## Participants (Preliminary - in Progress)

- Primary criteria
- (Optional) Secondary criteria 
- Number of participants who complete the sort should be at least 20. 
  - Past unmoderated studies have experienced a high abandonment rate, so the number of participants recruited should be double (40), using multiple emails to reach the total number recruited. 

## Recruitment Process
1. Researcher will work with Perigean to draft recruitment email and send out an interest email to Veterans
3. Veterans respond to the email and receive a link to the sort and code
4. After the sort, Veteran provides the code in the questionnaire after the sort
5. Send codes to Perigean every few days
6. Perigean sends another recruitment email (if needed)
