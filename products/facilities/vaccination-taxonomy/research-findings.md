# Research Findings: Health Services - Vaccination Services Taxonomy

01/20/2021

## Research Goals 

- Learn the Veteran mental models for vaccination within the health service taxonomy, primarily for VAMCs.

## Research Methodology 

Remote, moderated card sorting sessions were conducted via Zoom.

### Who we talked to
We spoke with 9 Veterans:

* All had visited a VA facility for health care over the last one to two years.
* Ages 35 to 74
* 5 in major metropolitan areas, 4 in rural areas
* 5 female, 4 male
* 7 Caucasian, 1 Asian, 1 Hispanic/Latino/Spanish Origin
* Diverse levels of education (some college to Master's degree)
* 8 had a disability rating of 70% or higher

### Research Questions

- Where in the VHA taxonomy do Veterans expect vaccination services to be found?
- Where in the VHA taxonomy do Veterans expect vaccination services to be found?
  - For example, do they expect to find it under primary care, with pharmacy (related to "medication"), under a particular specialty; or within a taxon named "Vaccination" (or similar)?
- What words do Veterans use when searching for vaccination-related services?
- What words do Veterans use when searching - such as
  - Vaccine/vaccination vs immunization vs shot
  - Flu or influenza
  - Coronavirus vs COVID
- Does the expectation change based on the type of vaccination?
  - Age-based (such as shingles or pneumococcal)
  - Risk-based (such as pneumococcal)
  - Seasonal flu
  - COVID vaccination/testing

### Interview Sessions

The sessions were structured as follows: 
- To provide context to the participants in preparation for the card sort, the moderator shared an example of a Health Services page. Participants gained an understanding of how health services are structured into categories, as well as the type of information contained in each.
- Participants were then asked to share their screen and open the web page containing the card sorting exercise.  
  - On the left side were cards with the names of vaccine types displayed: Influenza, Tetanus (used in two separate scenarios), COVID-19, Shingles, and travel-related vaccinations.
  - On the right side of the page, the following categories were displayed: Primary Care, Urgent Care, Emergency Care, Specialty Care, and Other Services.
  - Participants were given a scenario for each vaccine type, and then asked to move the appropriate card(s) into one or more of the categories on the right where they expected to find information about the vaccine. 
  - If none of the categories on the right seemed appropriate, participants had the option to create their own category and assign a a name that made sense to them.
  - Each scenario included an extra card to use if participants expected to find vaccine information in more than one category.
  - Scenarios were followed up with questions to better understand participants' thought process behind selections, the information they expected to see, and their own real-world experience with the vaccine (if applicable), either with the VA or with an external provider, and what terms they would use to search for that particular vaccine.
- Following the card sort, participants were asked what terms for vaccines they would use (vaccine, vaccination, immunization, shot, or other terms that weren't used in the card sort).
