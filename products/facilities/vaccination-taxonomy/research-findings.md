# Research Findings: Health Services - Vaccination Services Taxonomy

## First Edition - COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Information 

01/20/2021

## Research Goals 

- Learn the Veteran mental models for vaccination within the health service taxonomy, primarily for VAMCs.

## Research Methodology 

Remote, moderated card sorting sessions were conducted via Zoom.

### Who we talked to
We spoke with 9 Veterans:

* All had visited a VA facility for health care over the last one to two years.
* Ages 35 to 74
* 5 in major metropolitan areas, 4 in rural areas
* 5 female, 4 male
* 7 Caucasian, 1 Asian, 1 Hispanic/Latino/Spanish Origin
* Diverse levels of education (some college to Master's degree)
* 8 had a disability rating of 70% or higher

### Research Questions

- Where in the VHA taxonomy do Veterans expect vaccination services to be found?
  - For example, do they expect to find it under primary care, with pharmacy (related to "medication"), under a particular specialty; or within a taxon named "Vaccination" (or similar)?
- What words do Veterans use when searching for vaccination-related services?
- What words do Veterans use when searching - such as
  - Vaccine/vaccination vs immunization vs shot
  - Flu or influenza
  - Coronavirus vs COVID
- Does the expectation change based on the type of vaccination?
  - Age-based (such as shingles or pneumococcal)
  - Risk-based (such as pneumococcal)
  - Seasonal flu
  - COVID vaccination/testing

### Interview Sessions

The sessions were structured as follows: 
- To provide context to the participants in preparation for the card sort, the moderator shared an example of a Health Services page. Participants gained an understanding of how health services are structured into categories, as well as the type of information contained in each.
- Participants were then asked to share their screen and open the web page containing the card sorting exercise.  
  - On the left side were cards with the names of vaccine types displayed: Influenza, Tetanus (used in two separate scenarios), COVID-19, Shingles, and travel-related vaccinations.
  - On the right side of the page, the following categories were displayed: Primary Care, Urgent Care, Emergency Care, Specialty Care, and Other Services.
  - Participants were given a scenario for each vaccine type, and then asked to move the appropriate card(s) into one or more of the categories on the right where they expected to find information about the vaccine. 
  - If none of the categories on the right seemed appropriate, participants had the option to create their own category and assign a a name that made sense to them.
  - Each scenario included an extra card to use if participants expected to find vaccine information in more than one category.
  - Scenarios were followed up with questions to better understand participants' thought process behind selections, the information they expected to see, and their own real-world experience with the vaccine (if applicable), either with the VA or with an external provider, and what terms they would use to search for that particular vaccine.
- Following the card sort, participants were asked what terms for vaccines they would use (vaccine, vaccination, immunization, shot, or other terms that weren't used in the card sort).   

## Findings - COVID-19 Vaccine-Related Information

### Key Findings

1. Almost half of participants added COVID-19 vaccine information under Other Services.
2. A few participants expected to find COVID-19 vaccine information under Primary Care.
3. One participant added COVID-19 vaccine information under both the Primary Care and Urgent Care categories.
4. One participant added COVID-19 vaccine information under both the Other Services and Specialty Care categories.
5. One participant expected to find information about the COVID-19 vaccine under Urgent Care.
6. One participant expected to find information about the COVID-19 vaccine under Specialty Care.
7. A couple of participants created their own categories: "Vaccines" and "COVID-19"
8. When asked what information they would expect to find about the COVID-19 vaccine, participants generally fell into one of two groups:
    - Information about how to sign up for the vaccine, where they would receive it, and what priority group they would be a part of.
    - Information about the vaccine itself, its effectiveness, side-effects or cautionary statements, and when to receive a second shot.
9. All participants would use the term COVID in a search, while one would also search using the term Coronavirus.
10. When searching for vaccine information, all participants would look for terms such as vaccine, vaccination, immunization, and shot.
11. A couple of participants added "incocculation" to the list of vaccine search terms.

### Details of Findings

#### 1. Almost half of participants categorized COVID-19 vaccine information under Other Services.
Participants associated COVID-19 as a unique event, and perceived Other Services as a catch-all for such an event. 
> I would go to other services, they probably have so much going on with it, it is probably under a different category when you pull up the main va.gov page.

> In my mind COVID-19 to the extent of our experience, this is a one time event. Now I donâ€™t know if we are on a curve or will be annual, it is an extraordinary thing. COVID may become routine as well but for me the COVID-19 is extraordinary for a lot of reasons and its infancy. In the list of things to go to the doctor for, this is a unique event in my mind.


#### 2. A few participants expected to find COVID-19 vaccine information under Primary Care.
Although COVID-19 might be an unusual event, some participants felt that their PCP should be part of the conversation when it comes to the vaccine. 
> I guess mainly what my doctors thoughts are on the vaccine, with it being so new, and there are many diseases we can't find a vaccine for, but then we have one for COVID. I would want my doctors thoughts to wait or go with the initial one.

> I feel like primary care is linked with all of your health and with the unknowns about COVID 19 I think that is something I want my doctor to know about.

#### 3. One participant added COVID-19 vaccine information under both the Primary Care and Urgent Care categories.

#### 4. One participant added COVID-19 vaccine information under both the Other Services and Specialty Care categories.

#### 5. One participant expected to find information about the COVID-19 vaccine under Urgent Care.

#### 6. One participant expected to find information about the COVID-19 vaccine under Specialty Care.

#### 7. A couple of participants created their own categories: "Vaccines" and "COVID-19".

#### 8. When asked what information they would expect to find about the COVID-19 vaccine, participants generally fell into one of two groups:
   - Information about how to sign up for the vaccine, where they would receive it, and what priority group they would be a part of.
   - Information about the vaccine itself, its effectiveness, side-effects or cautionary statements, and when to receive a second shot.
#### 9. All participants would use the term COVID in a search, while one would also search using the term Coronavirus.

#### 10. When searching for vaccine information, all participants would look for terms such as vaccine, vaccination, immunization, and shot.

#### 11. A couple of participants added "incocculation" to the list of vaccine search terms.


## Additional Insights 

1. The majority of participants receive vaccines at least periodically. The Flu and Tetanus shots are the most commonly received.
2. Many participants receive vaccines regularly. 
3. A couple of participants are vaccine-hesitant.


## Recommendations

__COVID-19 Vaccine Information__
* Add a dedicated, easy-to-spot content section for COVID-19 vaccine information on Health Services pages. This will help Veterans locate the information, regardless of which category they might explore. 
* Cross-link to the content from other categories within the page to help direct Veterans to the information.
* In the COVID-19 section, provide two types of information:
  - The latest updates on how and Veterans can sign up, and contact information for additional questions not covered. 
  - Information on the vaccines themselves, including benefits, effectiveness and possible side effects.
