## What to know about the product 

### VHA Health Services Taxonomy

The VHA health services taxonomy is the official, customer-facing list of services offered across VA's 1,200 health care facilities. It was designed to create a consistent naming system for patients enrolled in VA health care. All VA digital health products should use the taxonomy.

**Business owner:** Jenny Heiland-Leudtke, VHA Digital Media (Jennifer.Heiland-Luedtke@va.gov)
