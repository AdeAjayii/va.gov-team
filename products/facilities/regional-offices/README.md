# VBA Facility Sites

This is the new VA.gov facility product for VA's Facilities that offer Benefits Services

- VBA runs 58 Regional Offices, with hundreds of child facilities (i.e., intake sites, VocRehab sites, Vet Success on Campus sites, and others?)
- Like VAMCs, ROs are a network of facilities; the Regional Office is the parent facility, and other benefits facilities are children
- VBA's facilities are unique because they provide VA benefits help for all three administrations (i.e., they will help you apply for health care and get burial benefits)

## What we need to do
- Research, design, and define the facilities heirarchical structure as it relates to Veteran needs and understanding
- Research, design, and write new content/create content guidelines for editors for "Prepare for your visit" section
- Research, design, and extend the VA services taxonomy to include VBA services; write as-necessary
- Research, design, and write (first draft/pilot) local facility content for each benefit service
- Build Regional Office/benefits facilities in Drupal
- Build and publish new front-end VA Regional Office facility product
- Research, design, and write new content for new facility products
- Integrate VBA facilities from Drupal into the Facilities API as source of truth
- Identify current users of VBA database, create sunset plan and deprecate VBA database

## Old/legacy Regional Office/benefits websites

We need to reach parity with our new Regional Office/benefits products so we can turn off all the old sites.

- Regional Office website: https://www.benefits.va.gov/ROWINSTONSALEM/index.asp
- Facility Locator RO facility detail page: https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vc_0201V
- Facility Locator benefits facility detail page: https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_318c


## Assumptions and early discussions

- VBA want to adopt the same facility system product template as the new VAMC product
  - Like VAMCs, ROs are a network of facilities; the Regional Office is the parent facility, and other benefits facilities are children *and this structure is important for the Veteran* (if this is the case, then it needs to be represented hierarchically in the Facilities API and Drupal)
- We need to design a Make An Appointment page that applies to all ROs
- VBA has "Satellite" Regional Office sites often located at VAMCs or Vet Centers
  - We need to figure out the user flows into VocRehab facilies and services, since users will be able to get to them from a VAMC site, RO sites, and Facility Locator
- VBA's Veteran Readiness and Employment sites are both stand-alone but also often times located at VAMCs or Vet Centers(VocRehab is built into the VHA health services taxonomy for this reason)
  - We need to figure out the user flows into VocRehab facilies and services, since users will be able to get to them from a VAMC site, RO sites, and Facility Locator
