Roles: When Pilot MVP editors are bulk uploaded into Drupal, they could have content creator and either content editor or content publisher roles. As was done with Vet Centers, readiness and review could be controlled through role elevation. Alternately, editor readiness and review could be controlled through process rather than role assignments.

Editors: Per Michelle's discussion with VBA national, the editors will be the same folks currently editing in Teamsite.

Supplemental status: Will continue to be supplemental rather than replace operating status for VBA. Because of this, supplemental status will be out of scope for Pilot MVP.
