# Research Plan for Facilities, Veteran Benefits Administration Pages, August 2022

## Background

Veteran Benefit Administration locations provide veterans with access to non-medical benefits. This can include things like:

*   education and training
*   pension
*   life insurance
*   home loans
*   special services for elderly, homeless, or veterans who are members of other marginalized groups.

The Veteran Benefit Administration pages seek to give important information about physical locations where veterans can seek help. The Veteran Benefit Administration pages are accessible through the public unauthenticated web. These pages are an expansion of existing information pages but with lots of new functionality that ties it in with existing location services.

### OCTO Objectives

This research aligns with the following OCTO Objectives

North Stars:

> 1\. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
> 
> 2\. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
> 
> 3\. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Goals:

> 1\. Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
> 
> 5\. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
> 
> 6\. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:

> *   Usage of digital, self-service tools
> *   Percent of applications submitted online (maybe, if we can help Veterans move from this tool to online application)
> *   Benefit use and enrollment
> *   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:

> *   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey

Veteran Benefits Administration pages touch on the following stages of the Veteran Journey:

*   Getting out (engaging VA to access benefits and services)
*   Starting Up (Finding something to do, re-establishing and creating relationships, balancing finances, finding a place to live)
*   Reinventing Myself (Acquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials)
*   Putting Down Roots (Revisiting housing, taking care of my family, saving for my retirement, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
*   Retiring (Finding additional sources of income)

## Research Goals

What are Veteran use cases for researching Veteran Benefit Administration locations?

### Outcome

It will give us a fuller understanding of what veterans need, and provide a baseline experience for empathizing with their goals. 

### Research questions

*   Do veterans understand the different types of facilities?
*   What are the top tasks that veterans seek out the Veteran Benefits Administration for? 
*   How important is the child location relationship to the RO for veterans?

### Hypothesis

What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? 

*   I don't really know anything about how veterans use this currently but I assume that it will be very similar to how they use existing vet center and VAMC search tools, and will follow standard industry practices for location search and detail page patterns. 

What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)

*   I think they will find having clear local location information, especially contact, hours, and description of service information extremely useful. 

## Method

*   Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research

### Location

Interviews will be held remotely with diverse locations. 

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

Recruited through Perigean.

### Recruitment criteria

List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**  
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study?

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.  
Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? \[answer should be yes to qualify.\]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**  
What criteria would strengthen your results?

## Timeline

Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.

### Prepare

When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

*   Pilot participant email:
*   Date and time of pilot session:

### Research sessions

*   Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions

*   Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, \< 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
*   Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time)
*   Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. _Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S._

Please request enough dates and at _**least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants**_. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; _**12 time slots for 6 participants**_). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.

## Team Roles

Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker**

*   Moderator:
*   Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):
*   Participant recruiting & screening:
*   Project point of contact:
*   Participant(s) for pilot test:
*   Note-takers:
*   Observers:

**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
