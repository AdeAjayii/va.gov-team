## Description

**Veteran-facing research** 
* The Research Lead should provide specific dates and time slots to Perigean as part of the Research Plan
* The Research Lead should create placeholder calendar events to block those time slots and invite other team members 
* Perigean will contact, screen, and schedule participants
* Perigean will create official calendar events and invite team members indicated in the Research Plan 
* If some Observers will only be invited to certain sessions, the Research Lead or Project Manager will need to coordinate that

**Editor-facing research**
* The Research Lead should work with Product Manager, Product Owner, and Business Stakeholders to identify a list of potential participants
* The Research Lead contacts and schedules participants 
* Consider creating a Calendly link (or equivalent) with available timeslots so that participants can pick the time that works for them
* The Research Lead should create placeholder calendar events to block those time slots and invite other team members 
* Once participants are scheduled, the Research Lead invites other team members to official calendar events

**Field Research** and **Unmoderated Studies**
* These types of studies have additional logistical considerations
* [Planning Unmoderated Studies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/planning-unmoderated-studies)
