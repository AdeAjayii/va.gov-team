# Template name: Research Synthesis & Topline Report
- **About:** Use this template when synthesizing your research and reporting the topline findings.
- **Issue default title:** Synthesize [PRODUCT/INITIATIVE] Research & Create Topline Report
- **Assignees** n/a
- **Labels:** Research, Design
- **Template content:** 

## Description

Methods for synthesizing research findings include:
- Organizing research notes in an [Affinity Diagram](https://miro.com/blog/create-affinity-diagrams/) to identify themes
- Rewatching session recordings to make additional notes & pull exact quotes
- Illustrating user flows on prototypes (usability testing)
- Statistical analysis
- Revisiting the hypotheses from the Research Plan to see which can be answered

Topline Report:
- Use the [Topline Summary Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/topline-summary-template.md) to summarize major findings
- Consult your Product Manager and Product Owner to see if a meeting should be scheduled to discuss the Topline Report
- Your PM and PO may have additional questions based on Topline Report that require additional synthesis
- This is just a summary of findings, no recommendations

Next Steps:
- The Research Lead should work with the Design Team & PM to create recommendations 
- The PM & PO should decide if a full research readout is required and who needs to be invited

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Topline Report is created, shared with PO, and updated if needed 
- [ ] PM & PO decide if a full research readout is required and who needs to be invited
