## 1 - Business Research

- Dave Conlon

### Methods
- Not a formal research process with a research plan, conversation guide, etc.
- Conversations with VBA employees
- Analytics 

### Timeline / Dependencies
- Began in July 2022 - will be ongoing
- üõë Some business research is a blocker for other research processes

### Research Questions

**Meta Project Questions**
- What are the intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope for MVP)?
  - Some VBA facility types? 
  - Leadership list?
  - Veteran Service Organizations?
- üõë  Which Regional Offices are going to be the MVP locations?
  - Change Management Agent (editor) and back-up
    - Need to validate CMA is the right role for the task
    - Need to validate CMA sevres this role at most VBA locations
  - Teams‚Äô responsibilities beyond the website
  - Priorities for upcoming Q3, Q4
  - Capacity for MVP
  - Key business stakeholders
  - Champions for this work
  - Advocates for future rollout
- Other VBA stakeholders not at MVP facilities
  - Regional oversight similar to VISNs?
  - By benefit business line?
- Is there a VBA-specific veteran journey map?
- What are the content governance pipelines? 
  - For facilities
  - For services / benefits

**Detailed Questions for MVP Definition**
- What other top tasks are available (e.g. Talk to someone online?) 
- How different are the types of facilities? Important to reflect?
- Prepare for your visit - What to bring
  - How does this vary by service?
  - How does this vary by facility?
- What else do Veterans need in order to be prepared for a visit (e.g. link to find a form?)
- What are the questions Veterans want answered by calling the phone number(s)? 
  - Is there a Call Center employee who could provide insight?
- How do we elaborate on the taxonomy structure to better explain the services?
  - How do services relate to benefit hubs?
- Is the service delivery the same across all locations nationally or locally nuanced? (Is the service description hardened nationally?)
- Per service 
  - Is there an online version of this tool? 
  - Are there benefits that Veterans already avail predominantly or entirely online? What tools/sites are these? 
  - Which tools result in work for a local benefits office, vs some central/national office? 
  - Should some benefits (Changing Direct Deposit?) be encouraged/promoted to be done online?
- Are Events National? Local? Hybrid? And what is the maintenance load?
- Are Spotlights National? Local? Hybrid? And what is the maintenance load?
- Is a list of Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) located at that facility important? 
  - Analytics on how many visits these pages get?


## 2 - Editor Research

[EPIC: VBA - Editor Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/10185)

### Team
- Denise Eisner - lead
- Dave Pickett
- Aslan French

### Methods
- Structured interviews with Research Plan and Conversation Guide

### Timeline / Dependencies
- 1 sprint - Draft Research Plan and Conversation Guide
- üõë - Interviews cannot be scheduled until MVP sites have been identified and connections with leadership have been established 
- 1 sprint - ‚ö†Ô∏è Scheduling interviews
- 1 sprint - Conducting interviews
- 1 sprint - Synthesize research & schedule readout
- 1 sprint - Research readout & documenting findings in research repo

### Research Questions

**VBA Editor Persona Questions**
- Number of potential editors (if each editor has a backup) and locations
- Reporting structure
  - Who they take direction from
- Level of understanding (high, medium, low) of web principles (accessibility, web writing, etc.)
  - This will relate to how hardened the content model is
- Other editor responsibilities and which take precedence, if any, over the website
- How editors view the purpose of the website in relation to other channels
- How work priorities are established and monitored
  - Estimated percentage of role that would be dedicated to the website
- Previous experience publishing web content
- Preferred way to learn how to use, or get support for, computer applications and tools at work
  - This will inform training approach
- Preferred way to get updates on changes or additions to the website CMS
  - This will inform change management approaches 

**Detailed VBA Facilities Content Questions for Editors**
- Is the service delivery the same across all locations nationally or locally nuanced? (What specifics would local editors want/need to adjust?)
- Is a list of Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) located at that facility important?
- Are Events National? Local? Hybrid? And what is the maintenance load?
- Are Spotlights National? Local? Hybrid? And what is the maintenance load?
- Is a list of Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs) located at that facility important?
- Is there a need for timely situational updates related to things such as parking or COVID facility status? 
- Is there an easily identifiable Top Tasks for editors? Can we quantify: Here are the Top XX things I do most frequently when currently updating the site, these other tasks are much less frequent.

## 3 - Veteran Research

[EPIC: VBA - Veteran Research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/10191)

- 1 sprint - ‚ö†Ô∏è Research Review Cycle & participant recruitment 
- 1 sprint - Conducting interviews
- 1 sprint - Synthesize research & schedule readout

### Research Questions

- Participant definition

- What other top task is available (e.g. Talk to someone online?) and do Veterans want that?
- How important to the Veteran is the relationship of "child" locations to the RO

  - Do we need additional research with veterans on service descriptions vs what has already been done?
