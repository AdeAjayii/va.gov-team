## Introduction

This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

### Services, Benefits, & Tasks

This first group of findings relates to [research questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/research/2022-9-public-contact/research-plan.md#research-questions) 1 & 2: 
1. What benefit-related services are offered at these facilities?
2. What do Veterans typically try to accomplish during an in-person facility visit?

#### 1 - Services at Regional Benefit Offices can be meaningfully categorized in at least four distinct ways

- **Benefit** (e.g. compensation, home loans, VR&E)
- **Task** (e.g. file a claim, check claim status, 1-on-1 interview)
- **Documents** (e.g. award letter, commissary letter, DD-214)
- **Beneficiary** (e.g. survivors, military retirees, caregivers)

> “Top three would be compensation, education, and pension.” - P3

> “Filing a claim is a big one, and then checking the status.” - P12

> “Most folks are looking for the tax letter.” - P5

> “Survivors’ benefits is a big one.” - P2

**Note:** One of the things I’m working on for the full report is a comprehensive list of the terms in these four categories and mapping important relationships between them (in so far as they surfaced in the interviews). Here’s a sneak peek at a relational table of benefits, tasks, and whether a Regional Office can help:

#### 2 - Public Contact staff primarily assist with the benefit of _disability compensation_

- Public Contact staff have end-to-end insight into the disability compensation process: determining eligibility, filing claims, checking claim status, filing appeals, resolving payment issues, etc.
- 6/12 participants listed compensation in the top three most common services

> “90% of the Veterans coming in are concerned about ‘What’s my percentage and how much money am I getting?’” - P7

> “Everyone understands that… this is where the money begins. Anything for money, they’re coming in.” - P5

> “It’s usually tied around ‘Where is my money?’” - P2
