## Introduction

This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Findings - Services, Benefits, & Tasks 

This first group of findings relates to [research questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/research/2022-9-public-contact/research-plan.md#research-questions) 1 & 2: 
1. What benefit-related services are offered at these facilities?
2. What do Veterans typically try to accomplish during an in-person facility visit?

### 1 - Services at Regional Benefit Offices can be meaningfully categorized in at least four distinct ways

- **Benefit** (e.g. compensation, home loans, VR&E)
- **Task** (e.g. file a claim, check claim status, 1-on-1 interview)
- **Documents** (e.g. award letter, commissary letter, DD-214)
- **Beneficiary** (e.g. survivors, military retirees, caregivers)

> “Top three would be compensation, education, and pension.” - P3

> “Filing a claim is a big one, and then checking the status.” - P12

> “Most folks are looking for the tax letter.” - P5

> “Survivors’ benefits is a big one.” - P2

**Note:** One of the things I’m working on for the full report is a comprehensive list of the terms in these four categories and mapping important relationships between them. There’s a sneak peek in the appendix.


### 2 - Public Contact staff primarily assist with the benefit of disability compensation

- Public Contact staff have end-to-end insight into the disability compensation process
- Can assist with many tasks: determining eligibility, filing claims, checking claim status, filing appeals, resolving payment issues, etc.
- 6/12 participants listed compensation in the top three most common services

> 90% of the Veterans coming in are concerned about "What’s my percentage and how much money am I getting?" - P7

> Everyone understands that… this is where the money begins. Anything for money, they’re coming in. - P5

> It’s usually tied around "Where is my money?" - P2

### 3 - Public Contact staff primarily assist with the task of applying for benefits 

- 9/12 participants listed “applying for benefits / filing a claim” as one of the top three most common services
- They are able to assist beneficiaries in applying for a wide range of benefits
- They have to refer beneficiaries elsewhere for support on follow-up tasks

> We're there to help Veterans fill out applications. - P9

> Probably filing new claims, you know, on the VA Form 21-526 EZ. Honestly, I could probably print 20 copies and go almost the whole week. - P10

> I can hand them an application to fill out. But PMC [Pension Management Center] would be the one process and handle it. - P5

> For education benefits we can't provide specific information to the customer. So we would have to refer them to an Education Call Center like Muskogee. - P3

### 4 - Providing beneficiaries official documents is a significant function of Regional Benefit Offices

- 6/12 participants listed “get a [benefit/award/tax] letter” as one of the top three most common services
- Sometimes they are printing new copies of documents that beneficiaries previously received
- Other times, a new document is being created

> “To get qualified for those funds from the City… they usually need that letter. The no-benefits letter, or the benefits letter.” - P5

> “If they are a certain percentage, they get a letter where they can go to the commissaries on base and shop. We provide those letters.” - P4

### 5 - There are few (if any) tasks that require a Veteran to be physically present at Regional Benefit Office
