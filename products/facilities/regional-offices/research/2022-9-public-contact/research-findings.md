## Research Goals

7 Veteran Benefit Administration (VBA) Regional Office (RO) facilities will be involved in the launch of the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for publishing VBA facility information in Drupal starting in early 2023.

The MVP will give the designated CMS editors a basic set of functionality to publish information about their facility operations on VA.gov so Veterans can successfully plan their next visit and perform other key tasks.

The Public Contact staff at these facilities provide front-line support to Veterans. We interviewed a sample of Public Contact staff to better understand the Veteran experience and service delivery models at the MVP Regional Office sites.  

Our goal was to understand from the perspectives of the Public Contact staff:

- **Service delivery model** for the facility (or group of facilities) for a geographic area
- **Common tasks** Veterans attempt to complete during in-person visits
- The **typical Veteran experience** (successes, expectations, frustrations, complaints) at these facilities

## Research Questions

1. What benefit-related **services are offered** at these facilities?
   * How do services differ by benefit types? 
   * Are any services shared across benefit types (e.g. updating contact info)?
   * Are all services available consistently throughout the week?
   * Do any services require referrals to other facilities?
   * Are there any services unique to this region/facility?

2. What do Veterans typically **try to accomplish** during an in-person facility visit?
   * What are the most common tasks they complete?
   * What are the least common tasks?
   * Can these tasks be accomplished other ways (phone, web)?
     * If so, why do Veterans do this task in-person?
   * How complicated are these common tasks?
   * How do Public Contact Staff assist Veterans in these tasks?
   * Any regionally specific needs (e.g. state or region specific support, translation)?
   * Any problems?
     * Tasks unable to complete
     * Tasks that Veterans usually get hung up on
     * Frustrations expressed by Veterans
     * How frequently are these problems encountered?

3. What is the **typical Veteran experience** when visiting these facilities?
   *	Typical wait times?
   *	Busier days or time?
   *	Appointments vs walk-ins?
   *	Common frustrations? Complaints?
   *	How Veterans usually arrive at the facility? (drive, public transit?) 
   *	How long does it take for a Veteran to travel to a facility

4. What do Veterans need to know or do to be adequately **prepared** for a visit?
   * Does this differ by service? 
   * Could they have found that information on the website?
   * Most common thing Veterans are missing?

## Methodology 

* Semi-structured interviews 
* Remote via Zoom

### Participants
* Spoke to 12 participants total representing the 7 MVP regions
* Length of time working for the VA 
  * 2 - 9 years = 7
  * 10 - 19 years = 3
  * 20+ years = 2
* Job titles included:
  * Legal Administrative Specialist = 5
  * Veteran Service Representative = 3
  * Coach = 2
  * "in public contact" = 2

### Facilities Represented
* 6 Regional Benefit Offices
  * [Albuquerque](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_340)
  * [Anchorage](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_463) located inside a VAMC
  * [Boston](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_301)
  * [Houston](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_362) located on a VAMC campus
  * [National Capital Region](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_372)
  * [San Juan](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_355)  
* 2 Satellite Offices
  * [Guam](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/facility/vba_459h)
  * Saipan ([no presence in Facility Locator](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-cms/issues/12112))
* 1 VAMC outreach location (part-time)
  * [Raymond G Murphy VAMC in Albuquerque](https://www.va.gov/new-mexico-health-care/locations/raymond-g-murphy-department-of-veterans-affairs-medical-center/)
  * From the [Albuquerque RO teamsite](https://www.benefits.va.gov/albuquerque/): 
  * > In addition, we have staff at the Raymond G. Murphy VA Medical Center on Tuesdays/Wednesdays/Thursdays from 8am-3:30pm. They are located in the Eligibility department by the main entrance. 
* Regardless of the specific facility type, these can collectively be considered **Public Contact Offices**

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

* The existing VBA service taxonomy does not accurately reflect the breadth of benefit-related tasks that can be accomplished at Regional Benefit Offices
  * TRUE - The current taxonomy has clear omissions, misleading terms, and lacks nuance
* A more robust VBA service taxonomy could increase Veteran self-service and help Veterans be fully prepared for visits to Regional Benefit Offices
  * NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION - This would depend on implementation and should be evaluated during usability testing
* The typical Veteran experience at Regional Benefit Offices is generally positive
  * PARTIALLY TRUE - The Veteran experience at stand-alone ROs is generally positive. Proximity to a VAMC (e.g. same building, same campus) increases both wait times and the mismatch between services expected and services available.

## Key Findings

**Services, benefits, & tasks**
1. Services at Public Contact Offices can be **categorized** in at least four distinct ways: benefits, tasks, documents, beneficiaries
2. Public Contact staff primarily assist with the **benefit** of disability compensation
3. Public Contact staff primarily assist with the **task** of applying for benefits
4. Providing beneficiaries **official documents** is a significant function of Public Contact Offices
5. Few (if any) services require a Veteran to be **physically present** at a Public Contact Offices

**Veteran experience**

6. A common source of Veteran frustration is a **mismatch between services expected and services available** at Public Contact Offices
7. There is little standardization in how Public Contact Offices handle **appointments**
8. **Wait times** at Public Contact Offices are primarily affected by facility location and staffing
9. Most services are consistently available during **normal operating hours**

**Veteran preparation**

10. Having a valid photo ID and a DD-214 is helpful regardless of service
11. Some Public Contact Offices are located in Federal buildings with security checkpoints, which can affect timing
