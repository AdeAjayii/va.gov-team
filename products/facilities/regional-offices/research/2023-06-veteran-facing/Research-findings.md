## Research Goals
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on the new modernized design for VBA regional office sites.

There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) when they might want to know whether they may be eligible for VA health care with their current income:
* Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
* Starting up (Finding something to do, Finding a place to live)
* Taking care of myself (Managing primary care and chronic health issues > Disability Compensation)
* Putting down roots (Revisiting housing, Taking care of my family, Saving for my retirement, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
* Retiring (Finding additional sources of income)

## Research Questions
Before seeing the prototype:
1. What do Veterans (and others) know about VA regional benefit offices?
2. What tasks do Veterans (and others) expect to do at VA regional benefit offices?

From the prototype:
3. Do Veterans (and others) understand which services are available at this location?
* Categories of services (i.e., Veteran benefits, Family member & caregiver benefits, Service member benefits, Other services)
* Service offering accordions that have multiple locations inside them
* What if they don't find an applicable service on the page?

4. Do Veterans (and others) understand how services are delivered at this location?
* In-person, virtual, or by phone (do people open the appointments accordion unprompted?)
* With or without appointments (any comments about location of appointments information?)
* Hours of operation--for the office vs. only for a specific service
* Hours of operation--2 sets of hours in a single day (i.e., morning and afternoon but closed for lunch hour), comment about one of the days
* Notice different hours/appointments per service vs. regional office in general?

5. What feedback do Veterans (and others) have on content, organization, and length of the regional benefit office web page?
* Do Veterans (and others) interact with any of the Prepare for your visit accordions?
* Do Veterans (and others) interact with any of the 3 action links near the top of the page? If so, which ones?
* How do Veterans (and others) react to seeing 2 phone numbers? Which phone number would they use and why? What do they expect when they call?

## Methodology 
We conducted **usability testing** on August 28-September 5, 2023 to get feedback from research participants using a click-through prototype over Zoom. Perigean recruited the participants.

**We talked to 8 Veterans** and two Veteran's family members.
-5 of 10 used a smartphone for the session, 4 used a computer, 1 used a tablet

For more details, see [Who we talked to](#who-we-talked-to).

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
* Veterans (and others) will understand what they can do at a VA benefit office from the new web page.
  * **TRUE** - Almost all participants were able to locate the service accordions when prompted.
    
* Veterans (and others) will understand how services are delivered at this location from the new web page.
  * **SOMEWHAT TRUE** - About 2/3 of participants were able to identify appointment modalities, only half identified hours of service for specific tasks.
  * Success rates on these tasks was significantly for certain demographics, including Veterans with cognitive disabilities and those over 55 years old.
    
* Veterans (and others) will understand how to prepare for a visit to a VA benefit office from the new web page.
  * **MOSTLY FALSE** - Only half of participants interacted with the Prepare for your visit accordion and located the What to bring section.
  *  Success rates were lower for participants with cognitive disabilities and BIPOC participants.
  *  Participants made liberal use of the three Action links at the top of the page--Make an appointment, Ask a benefit question, and Check claim status--even when these links wouldn't help them complete the task.
    
* Veterans (and others) will know what to do if they don't find the kind of help they need on the new web page.
  * **TRUE** - Nearly all participants identified a phone number to call for help.

## Key Findings
1. The organization of services sections matches Veterans' expectations of how the page should be organized.
