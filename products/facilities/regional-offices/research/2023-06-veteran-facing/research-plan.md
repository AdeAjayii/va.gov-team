### OCTO Objectives

This research aligns with the following [OCTO Objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme).

North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

Goals:
1. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
1. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Benefit use and enrollment
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey 
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and benefits from the VBA throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Finding something to do, Finding a place to live)
- Taking care of myself (Managing primary care and chronic health issues > Disability Compensation)
- Putting down roots (Revisiting housing, Taking care of my family, Saving for my retirement, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Retiring (Finding additional sources of income)

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the new design for VBA regional facility pages**.

### Outcome
Learnings will help refine the design of the pages before piloting an MVP with 7 sites.

### Research questions
1. What do Veterans know about VA regional benefits offices?
     1. What tasks do Veterans expect to do at VA regional benefits offices?
     2. What do Veterans expect to find on a web page about a VA regional benefit office?
3. What feedback do Veterans have on content, organization, and length of the regional benefit office web page?
5. When prompted with specific tasks, do Veterans navigate to the correct service accordion and find the correct next steps? 
5. Do Veterans interact with any of the 3 action links near the top of the page? If so, which ones? Are these "top tasks"?
6. How do Veterans react to seeing 2 phone numbers?
     1. Which phone number would they use and why? 
     2. What do they expect when they call?
7. What do Veterans expect to find in the Pension section under "Services offered"?
8. Do Veterans understand the difference between in-person and virtual appointments?
9. _Something from Michelle about hours of operation?_


### Hypotheses
1. Veterans will learn what they can do at a VA benefits office by looking at the new web page.
2. Veterans will learn how to prepare for a visit to a VA benefits office from the new web page.
3. ???

## Method	
We will conduct **usability testing** to guide research participants through a click-through prototype. 

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like **Zoom transcripts please**. 

### Ideas for Prototype:
- Make the 3 action links at the top of the page go somewhere
- Make the 3 links under "On this page" work
- Include some content under the "Limited services and hours" additional info component, if including it

### Ideas for Conversation Guide
- Warm up questions about what regional benefit offices are, whether you've been to one before, what you might do there or have done there before, what you'd do before your visit (search for info online? where?)
- If you wanted to visit a VA benefits office near you, what would you do? (google? VA.gov > facility locator?) 
- How could you find out whether it could help you with X? _(applying for disability compensation?)_
- Open prototype, and tell me your impressions of this page (regional benefit office)
- How could you figure out whether it could help you with X?
- To make this happen, what would you do next (make appt, figure out how to get there, learn what to bring and gather it)
- How to find the benefits office in the building? call?
- How could you talk to someone at the VA about whether the VA will pay for more school for you?  
- Ask at end after saw prototype: What do you think you can do from this VA office?

## Timeline

### Prepare

**Prior to the kickoff call, I would like a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey** for this study so I can review it beforehand.

I have scheduled the following two **pilot tests**:
- Pilot 1: **TBD ET** with TBD (TBD.us)
- Pilot 2: **TBD ET** with TBD (TBD.us)

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: **TBD** 

We would like to request that **Perigean calls each participant** to remind them about the session, in addition to emailing them. And please include the session time **in each participant's own time zone** (from a screener question).

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
* Maximum sessions per day: 3
