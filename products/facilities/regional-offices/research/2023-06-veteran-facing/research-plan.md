### OCTO Objectives _REDO!!_

This research aligns with the following [OCTO Objectives]([url](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme)).

North Stars:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
3. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Goals:

1. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
1. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:
- Usage of digital, self-service tools
- Percent of applications submitted online (maybe, if we can help Veterans move from this tool to online application)
- Benefit use and enrollment
- Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:
- Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey _REDO!!_
There are many potential touchpoints between the Veteran and this application throughout the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):
- Getting out (Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting up (Attending to health needs)
- Taking care of myself (Recognizing and addressing mental health needs, Managing primary care and chronic health issues, Seeking support for an acute health event, Maintaining my health)
- Retiring (Taking care of my health)
- Aging (Managing my declining health)

## Research Goals	
The purpose of this research is to **get user feedback on the newly designed VBA regional facility pages**.

### Outcome
Learnings will help refine the design of the pages before the pilot starts with 7 sites.

### Research questions
1. 


### Hypotheses
1. 

## Method	
We will conduct **usability testing** to guide research participants through a click-through prototype. 

Sessions will be conducted over Zoom, and we would like **Zoom transcripts please**.

## Timeline

**Prior to the kickoff call, I would like a link or screenshot of the recruitment survey** for this study so I can review it beforehand.

I have scheduled the following two **pilot tests**:
- Pilot 1: **TBD ET** with TBD (TBD.us)
- Pilot 2: **TBD ET** with TBD (TBD.us)

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: **TBD** 

We would like to request that **Perigean calls each participant** to remind them about the session, in addition to emailing them. And please include the session time **in each participant's own time zone** (from a screener question).

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
