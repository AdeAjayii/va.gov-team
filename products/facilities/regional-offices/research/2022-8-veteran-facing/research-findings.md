# Research Goals

## Veteran Journey

Benefit Offices touch on the following stages of the Veteran Journey:

* Getting out (engaging VA to access benefits and services)
* Starting Up (Finding something to do, re-establishing and creating relationships, balancing finances, finding a place to live)
* Reinventing Myself (Acquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials)
* Putting Down Roots (Revisiting housing, taking care of my family, saving for my retirement, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
* Retiring (Finding additional sources of income)

## Goals

The goal of this research is to understand a Veterans' experiences, impressions, and relationships with Benefit Offices.

# Research Questions

1. What benefit-related tasks do Veterans complete at Benefit Offices?
   * Is visiting a Benefit Office necessary/sufficient to complete the task?
   * Do Veterans have preferred modalities for doing this task?
   * If in-person/phone/online were all available, which would they choose?
   * Do Veterans' mental models of benefit tasks align to the actual processes?
2. What is the Veteran experience of visiting a Benefit Office?
   * How do Veterans travel to Benefit Offices?
   * How do Veterans find their way to appointments within Benefit Office buildings?
   * What is the reception experience at Benefit Offices? (i.e. check-in, waiting area)
3. What information do Veterans need when preparing for a visit?
   * How do Veterans prepare for their visits?
   * What tasks do they complete? (i.e. directions, paperwork)
   * What modalities do they use? (i.e. web, phone)
   * Do Veterans feel prepared before their visits?
   * Are they actually prepared?
   * Retrospectively, what would they have needed to be prepared?
4. Do Veterans understand the different types of Benefit Offices?
   * If yes, do Veterans understand the relationships between Benefit Offices?
   * Are these relationships important to Veterans?
5. To what extent do the answers to questions 1-3 vary by:
   * Facility type?
   * Benefit service?
   * Geography?
   * Veteran demographics?

# Methodology

* Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

* FALSE: most people had good experiences with the actual logistics of the visit, such as parking, wayfinding regardless of facility type or geography. .
* We expect moderate variance by benefit service
* FALSE: most people had good experiences with the actual visit and little trouble finding the location, parking, regardless of benefit service sought.
* We expect little to no variance by Veteran demographics
* TRUE

1. What information do Veterans need when preparing for a visit?

* We expect high variance by facility type and benefit service
* FALSE: Most vets did not do much prep for their visit regardless of facility type or benefit service.

# Key Findings

1. Veterans would like to use the website to complete tasks when the steps are clear
2. Veterans prefer to speak to a person on-site if they can’t find clear information online
3. Veterans expect Regional Benefit Offices to be “one-stop shops” for services
4. Veterans aren’t sure of what tasks they can complete at the various VA offices

# Details of Findings

**Finding #1: Veterans would like to use the website to complete tasks  when the steps  are clear**

* Most Veterans (10 / 12) prefer to complete their tasks online if the information and instructions are clear
  * Veterans cite convenience as necessary for completing their tasks
  * No one rated phone as their #1 preferred contact method
    * 7 / 12 rated phone as their last preference for contact
* Most Veterans used the website first to get information about their benefits and tasks to be completed
  * Half of the sample expressed that the information they need is not easily found on the website

> _“If they offer it online, I would do it online. I do everything online. I have done request for records online, and that is way easier because before you had to go to the VA.”_ -p4

>_“I guess I wish that information was easier found out there [the website]. It may be, but I haven’t found it.”_ -p3

>_“Depending on what the task was I would rather do it online if I trusted it would get done properly”_ -p17

**Finding #2: Veterans prefer to speak to a person on site if they cannot  find clear information online first**

* Veterans are more likely to visit the benefits office when they need additional information to complete their tasks
* Half of the Veterans interviewed attempted to find answers to their questions online first
* When Veterans couldn’t complete every step in the process themselves, they had confidence that the in-office staff could help them figure out next step(s)
  * Veterans expressed a high level of trust with the staff at the Benefits Office

> _“I did go to the benefits website and it gave me a little information on what programs are available, but I do like sitting down with someone to get the information.”_ -p14

> _“One-stop shopping is why I picked this one [regional benefits office]. I knew I could do everything in this office. I did some researching, and you could click on a toggle and this one popped up with everything I needed to handle I could do it at this site.”_ -p2

Finding #3: Veterans encountered problems with authenticated experience.

* No one reported any difficulties finding hours or location information on the VA website
* Veterans reported problems with difficulty logging in, tracking the status of their applications, submitting applications digitally, which are all authenticated parts of the website.

”I was looking to see if they could get me a copy of my case file, but they can not do that. I was trying to find out if my disability was static and the folks wanted nothing to do with me. I felt like I was interrupting their conversation that had nothing to do with the VA.” - p13

Finding #4: Veterans found the information they wanted on the VBA website or Google Maps.

* No one reported any difficulties finding hours or location information on the VA website
* Veterans often didn’t check the VA websites, and instead relied solely on Google Maps.

”I had been there before because it is in the Satellite Office in the Department of Labor I had been there before when I got laid off. I Googled map to remind me of where it is at. Satellite I have in my phone, so I just had to click on the contact info and it popped up in my Google Maps.” - p9

Finding #5: Veterans expect Benefit Centers to be “one stop shops” for services.

* Only 1/12 Veterans interviewed expressed interest in knowing what specific services were available at the location they visited.
* Veterans preferred to get the location information and immediately go and walk in and start asking questions with a human.
* 9/12 Veterans visited a Regional Office and had no problems finding the services they needed.
* 1/12 visited an IDESS location but they already knew what specialized service they were pursuing.

”No, those guys are pretty good about all that stuff. When I set up the appointment, he had an idea of what I was coming in with. I asked him if I needed to bring anything in with me, he told me no. If he needed something he could request it online, very rarely did I need to come home and grab records from home. Whoever is setting up the appointment will tell me if I need to bring anything” - p9

Finding #6: Veterans demonstrated a sophisticated use of ad hoc social media communities to inform their relationship with the VA.

* A Veteran reported using a subreddit called VeteranBenefits to inform their seeking a Disability benefit upgrade.
* A Veteran reported following a Youtuber who was a disabled Veteran.

”I first found out about it on a subreddit, VeteranBenefits” - p13

# Additional Insights

* Benefit tasks Veterans sought to complete:

  * Increasing disability rating was the most common by far, 9/12.
  * Seeking VA license plate
  * Seeking guidance with education needs
  * Seeking help getting name change
  * Securing a home loan
  * Seeking education funding
  * Job placement services
  * Forms assistance
  * Determining access to mental healthcare benefits

* Visiting the offices were necessary to gain information but Veterans did not  complete all necessary tasks in their visit.
* Veterans do not understand the VA processes, and instead rely on direct human guidance for everything.
* “I just go in because then I can talk to someone and ask questions.” -p9
* Veteran experience visiting the actual offices:
* Good customer experience with the office.
* 11/12 stated they had a good experience with the receptionist and waiting room process.
* Everyone interviewed went by car.
* 1/12 Veterans made appointments.
* Veterans relied on receptionists at the front desk to find the person they needed to speak to or their appointment.
* All offices were reported as relying on a check-in and waiting area system.
* Information that Veterans need before their visit:
* They need their discharge form: DD-214
* How Veterans prepare for their visits:
* Most Veteran’s preparation consisted of bringing their discharge paperwork and looking up the address and that’s about it. Some spoke with friends or VSOs beforehand, or read/watched social media and commented on forums but many relied heavily on a sort of “show up and ask questions” approach.
* Veterans feel prepared for their visit when asked.
* Veterans do appear to be prepared as much as they can be expected to.
* P3 specifically was unable to get their disability situation figured out due to some back and forth coordination issues between the Benefit Office and a VSO.
* Veterans express a desire for better online submission and application tools.
* Veterans do not understand the difference between different kinds of offices.
* Regional and Satellite offices could be understood based on their name alone.
* IDESS  gave everyone trouble (except for the one person who had visited an IDESS on purpose)
* Pre-discharge and campus could be guessed based on prior knowledge. Veterans having been discharged themselves inferred pre-discharge was a site you visited prior to being discharged.
* Veterans did not know the relationship between offices other than by inference such as Satellite and Regional Offices.
* These relationships are not important to Veterans and they expect everything to be a “one-stop-shop”.
* Answer Variance by context:
* Facility type:
* Not much, but also we lack the sample size to really determine this information.
* Benefit service:
* Not much, but also we lack the sample size to really determine this information.
* Geography:
* Not much, but also we lack the sample size to really determine this information.
* Veteran demographics:
* Not much, but also we lack the sample size to really determine this information.

# Recommendations

* Create VBA pages to follow existing facilities patterns

  * No reports of people not finding the info they wanted on the website
  * Most Veterans got information from Google Maps and didn't really need much more than that.
  * Veteran pain points had to do with authenticated experiences, not public pages.
  *
* Follow up on potential research into synchronous and asynchronous human 2 human communication solutions
* Veterans consistently cited a desire to speak to a person in person when they visited the locations. The actual relationship aspect of this is key.
* Veterans sought out and used unofficial social media communities to great effect.
* Follow up on potential research into Veteran awareness of what services are available to them.
