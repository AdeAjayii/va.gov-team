# Research Goals
## Veteran Journey
Benefit Offices touch on the following stages of the Veteran Journey:

- Getting out (engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Starting Up (Finding something to do, re-establishing and creating relationships, balancing finances, finding a place to live)
- Reinventing Myself (Acquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials)
- Putting Down Roots (Revisiting housing, taking care of my family, saving for my retirement, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
- Retiring (Finding additional sources of income)

## Goals
The goal of this research is to understand a Benefit Office clients' experiences, impressions, and relationships with Benefit Offices.

### Outcome
It will give us a fuller understanding of what Benefit Office clients need, and allow us to make design recommendations for the Regional Benefit Office MVP. 



# Research Questions

1.  What benefit-related **tasks** do clients complete at Benefit Offices?
    *   Is visiting a Benefit Office necessary/sufficient to complete the task?
    *   Do clients have preferred modalities for doing this task? 
        *   If in-person/phone/online were all available, which would they choose?
    *   Do clients' mental models of benefit tasks align to the actual processes?

2.  What is the client experience of **visiting** a Benefit Office?
    *   How do clients travel to Benefit Offices?
    *   How do clients find their way to appointments within Benefit Office buildings?
    *   What is the reception experience at Benefit Offices? (i.e. check-in, waiting area)
  
3.  What information do clients need when **preparing** for a visit?
    *   How do clients prepare for their visits? 
        *   What tasks do they complete? (i.e. directions, paperwork)
        *   What modalities do they use? (i.e. web, phone)
    *   Do clients feel prepared before their visits?
        *   Are they actually prepared?
        *   Retrospectively, what would they have needed to be prepared?
    *   Do clients understand the different types of Benefit Offices?
        *   If yes, do clients understand the relationships between Benefit Offices?
        *   Are these relationships important to clients?

4. To what extent do the answers to questions 1-3 **vary** by:
   *   Facility type? 
   *   Benefit service?
   *   Geography?
   *   Client demographics?


# Methodology 

*   Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research


# Hypotheses and Conclusions


### Hypotheses

1.  What benefit-related **tasks** do clients complete at Benefit Offices? 
    * We expect high variance by facility type and benefit service
      * FALSE: majority of Veterans were looking to engage with disability benefits.  
    * We expect moderate variance by client demographics
      * FALSE: not much variance between demographics  
    * We expect little to no variance by geography
      * TRUE 

2.  What is the client experience of **visiting** a Benefit Office? - 
    * We expect high variance by facility type and geography
      * FALSE: most people had good experiences with the actual visit and little trouble finding the location, parking etc. 
    * We expect moderate variance by benefit service
      * FALSE: most people had good experiences with the actual visit and little trouble finding the location, parking etc. 
    * We expect little to no variance by client demographics
      * TRUE 

3.  What information do clients need when **preparing** for a visit? 
    * We expect high variance by facility type and benefit service
      * FALSE: Most vets did not do much prep for their visit 
    * We expect moderate variance by client demographics
      * FALSE: Most vets did not do much prep for their visit 
    * We expect little to no variance by geography
      * TRUE 


# Key Findings

1. Veterans want to speak with a human
2. Wants to complete tasks online
3. Problems encountered were never really connected to VBA website content issues.


# Details of Findings 

**Finding #1: Veterans want to speak with a human**

- "It's faster to just go in and hand them a paper form"
- Doesn't like being treated like a number. 
- Doesn't trust automated systems or is worried about the status of their application and not sure how to find that info. 
- Questions are dynamic and complex and not easily slotted into reviewing an FAQ page online. 


**Finding #2: Wants to complete tasks online**

- Lots of people rate online as their 1st preference for completeing task despite their actions of going in person. 
- Convenience was stressed. 
- Wants up to date access to all their paperwork and forms, and the status of everything. 
- People do not want to call because they feel like they never can find the right person and are easier to deflect

**Finding #3: Problems encountered were never really connected to VBA website content issues.**

- Most people seem to get information from google maps and not from the VBA website
- No one reported any difficulties finding hours or location information on the va website
- Vets did not seem interested in checking "services available" before visiting or even really there being any distinction between one VBA location and another (as evidenced by the fact that proximity seems to be the only relevant filter). 
- Website problems were related to lack of access to information in the authenticated experience, login, other things not related to the public facing websites

# Recommendations

* Create VBA pages to follow existing facilities patterns
    * No reports of people not finding the info they wanted on the website
    * Most Veterans got information from Google Maps and didn't really need much more than that. 
    * Veteran pain points had to do with authenticated experiences, not public pages. 
* Possibly pland research to follow up on sync and async human 2 human communication solutions
    * Veterans cited consistently a desire to speak to a person in person when they visited the locations.
