This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

**Finding #1: Veterans want to speak with a human**

- "It's faster to just go in and hand them a paper form"
- Doesn't like being treated like a number. 
- Doesn't trust automated systems or is worried about the status of their application and not sure how to find that info. 
- Questions are dynamic and complex and not easily slotted into reviewing an FAQ page online. 


**Finding #2: Wants to complete tasks online**

- Lots of people rate online as their 1st preference for completeing task despite their actions of going in person. 
- Convenience was stressed. 
- Wants up to date access to all their paperwork and forms, and the status of everything. 
- People do not want to call because they feel like they never can find the right person and are easier to deflect

**Finding #3: Problems encountered were never really connected to VBA website content issues.**

- Most people seem to get information from google maps and not from the VBA website
- No one reported any difficulties finding hours or location information on the va website
- Vets did not seem interested in checking "services available" before visiting or even really there being any distinction between one VBA location and another (as evidenced by the fact that proximity seems to be the only relevant filter). 
- Website problems were related to lack of access to information in the authenticated experience, login, other things not related to the public facing websites
