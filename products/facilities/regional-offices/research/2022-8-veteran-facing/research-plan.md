## Background

Benefit Offices provide clients (Veterans, service members, family members, caregivers, etc.) access to non-medical benefits. This can include things like:

*   education and training
*   pension
*   life insurance
*   home loans
*   special services for elderly, homeless, or Veterans who are members of other marginalized groups.

The Benefit Office webpages seek to give important information about physical locations where beneficiaries can apply for and receive benefits. Benefit Office pages are accessible through the public unauthenticated web. These pages expand on prior work done with Facility Locator, VAMCs, and Vet Centers.

### OCTO Objectives

This research aligns with the following OCTO objectives:

North Stars:

> 1\. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
> 
> 2\. Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
> 
> 3\. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

Goals:

> 1\. Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
> 
> 5\. Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
> 
> 6\. Veterans and their families trust the security, accuracy, and relevancy of VA.gov

Increase:

> *   Usage of digital, self-service tools
> *   Percent of applications submitted online (maybe, if we can help Veterans move from this tool to online application)
> *   Benefit use and enrollment
> *   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov

Decrease:

> *   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey

Benefit Offices touch on the following stages of the Veteran Journey:

*   Getting out (engaging VA to access benefits and services)
*   Starting Up (Finding something to do, re-establishing and creating relationships, balancing finances, finding a place to live)
*   Reinventing Myself (Acquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials)
*   Putting Down Roots (Revisiting housing, taking care of my family, saving for my retirement, Engaging VA to access benefits and services)
*   Retiring (Finding additional sources of income)

## Research Goals

The goal of this research is to understand a Benefit Office clients' experiences, impressions, and relationships with Benefit Offices.

### Outcome

It will give us a fuller understanding of what Veterans need, and provide a baseline experience for empathizing with their goals. 

### Research questions

1.  What benefit-related **tasks** do clients complete at Benefit Offices?
    *   Is visiting a Benefit Office necessary/sufficient to complete the task?
    *   Do clients have a preference for doing this task in-person (if other options are available)?
    *   Do clients' mental models of benefit tasks align to the actual processes?

2.  What is the client experience of **visiting** a Benefit Office?
    *   How do clients travel to Benefit Offices?
    *   How do clients find their way to Benefit Offices within multipurpose buildings?
    *   What is the check-in experience at Benefit Offices?

3.  What information do clients need when **preparing** for a visit?
    *   What are the tasks that clients need to complete online before a visit?
    *   What are the questions clients want answered by calling Benefit Office phone number(s)?
    *   Do clients need to understand the different types of Benefit Offices and the relationships between them?

### Hypothesis

*   Do Veterans find it easy and useful to get information about Regional Offices? 

Hypothesis: yes

What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)

*   I think they will find having clear local location information, especially contact, hours, and description of service information extremely useful.

## Method

*   Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research

### Location

Remote, via Zoom. 

## Research Materials

*   [Conversation Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/regional-offices/research/2022-8-veteran-facing/conversation-guide.md)
