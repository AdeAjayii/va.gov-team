## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today. My name is Dave.  I also have some colleagues on the line listening and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about VA Benefit Offices. We're trying to learn about Veterans', service member's, and caregivers' experiences with Benefit Offices.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

*   **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.**
*   **This session is going to resemble an interview where I will ask you many questions about your experience with VA Benefit Offices.** There are no right or wrong answers, this is purely to understand actual client experiences. If at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can move on to the next question.
*   **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
*   **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
*   This session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after the call is analyzed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I will ask again to confirm that you're ok with me recording this session so that it's captured in the recording.

_Start recording._

* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?"


## Warm-up Questions

*  Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

## Baseline Questions

* In the pre-interview survey, you indicated that you had visited a VA Benefits Office in the last 6 months. Specifically, you visited a [Answer to Screener Question #1 - type of facility], is that correct?
* In your own words, could you briefly describe the reason for your visit to that office?
* [Confirm benefit-related service(s)]Okay, so just to confirm, it sounds like this visit was related to [benefit type], correct? 
   *  [This should line up with answer to screener question #2. If not ask follow up.]
   *  On the survey, you also listed [answer to screener question #2 - benefit type], could you tell me about that?

## Benefit Task Questions

* Okay, for this next part, we're going to talk about the whole process of you managing your [benefit]. That includes steps you completed before or after your visit to the benefit office. 
  * [If multiple benefits were indicated in baseline questions, focus on one benefit type at a time]
* Imagine I am a Veteran/service member/caregiver who doesn't know anything about this benefit, and I came to you for advice about it. How would you describe it to me based on your experience?
  * [Potentially follow up prompts]
  * What steps are involved in this process?
  * How did you figure that out?
  * Anything else I should watch out for?
* Now to focus back on the part where you visited the benefit office. You said that you went there to do [specific task], correct?
  * What prompted you to visit the office? (i.e. referral, websearch, etc.)
  * Were you able to complete the task during the visit?
    * Did you visit multiple offices?
    * Did you have to visit the same office multiple times?
  * Was there another way you could have completed the task?
  * If you had the option of completing this task online/ by phone/ or in-person, what would your preference be?
* Is there anything else about this task or this benefit you want to share?
* [Repeat questions if there are multiple tasks or benefits]

## Visiting Questions

* Okay, now we're going to talk specifically about the day you visited the benefit office. 
* Where is this office located?
* How did you travel to the office? 
* Did anyone accompany you on the visit?
* Did you have any issues getting to the building (directions, parking, etc)?
* Once you were inside the building, how did you find your way to the floor/room you needed?
  * Was there any signage that guided you?
  * Did you speak with any employees? (e.g. receptionist)
  * Was there a waiting area of any kind?
  * How did you know when you were at the right place?
* Was there any information you wish you had that day that would have made your visit easier?
  * [Could use the "Imagine I am a veteran..." prompt again here if that worked before]
