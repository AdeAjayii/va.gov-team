## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today. My name is Dave, I am a web designer for the VA. How are you doing today?

I have a colleague with us in this session who will be taking notes.

There are a few of my teammates who would like to watch this session. **Would it be OK with you if I invited them to join us?**

* *(If yes, let them in. If no, post to #feedback-backchannel "Sorry, the participant doesn't want any observers in this session.")*
* "These are my colleagues Adam, Brenda, and Chris. I'm going to ask them to wave hello and then they will turn off their cameras to limit distractions while we talk."

Today we're going to talk about VA Benefit Offices, these include Regional Offices, Veteran Readiness and Employment Offices, Pre-Discharge Sites and a couple other types. We're trying to learn about Veterans', service member's, and caregivers' experiences with visiting these locations.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

*   **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.**
*   **This session is going to resemble an interview where I will ask you many questions about your experience with VA Benefit Offices.** There are no right or wrong answers, this is purely to understand your actual experiences. If at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, we can move on to the next question.
*   **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
*   **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
*   This session will be recorded to ensure that I capture your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after the call is analyzed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
    * If yes: Once I start recording, I will ask again to confirm that you're ok with me recording this session so that it's captured in the recording.

*Start recording.*

* **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"
