## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Aslan. Today we're going to talk about the Veteran Benefits Administration pages. Mostly what I'm looking to do is get to know you and learn more about how you interact with the VA website.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

*   **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.**
*   **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
*   **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
*   **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?**

_Start recording._

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - X minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a little warm up introduction.

*   Name
*   Where are you from?
*   What VA location have you visited in the last 6 months?
*   Just for fun, if you could have any superpower, what would you want?

## Questions

(the following questions are sort of a scattershot that may diverge some from the script depending on the answers given by the participant)

*   Do you know what kinds of facilities that the VA runs?
*   What do they do?
*   Which kinds have you used the most?
*   What kinds of things do you use them for?
*   What kinds of things do you wish you could use them for?
*   Have you ever used a regional or benefits office?
*   Which location have you used the most?
*   Is that a regional office?
*   Do you know what a regional office is?
*   Do you use facilities other than a regional office?
*   Do you know what a child office is or do you ever use a child office?
*   Why do you use a regional office versus a child office?
*   What kind of information do you need from a regional office before visiting it?
*   What kind of information have you found on the website when visiting a regional office?
*   What had you wished you known before a visit to a facility once you got there?

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

\[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.\]
