### Full transcript

- [Introductions, recording interview, and showing the current legacy site]
- [Nick] Who would you say this facility is most likely to serve in terms of demographics?

> Well, it's all on the page, the page you just went to. We have short-term and we do have a long-term stay - and we have hospices there.

- [Nick] How do people staying there refer to the facility?

  - [Explains that "Community Living Center" is common among people who stay  there]

- [Nick] Is there anything that anyone with physical limitations should know before coming into the program? [No] Is there a maximum physical disability you're able to accomodate?

> I don't know. We haven't had any challenges like that. I wouldn't go there [the website] and put any maximum challenges or anything like that, I would keep it generic. 
> Pretty much what's on the page now is what we want on the page. If you want to reformat [that's fine] - is there something different we need to add?

[Nick] I think there's some specifics anbout the admissions process that we could do a better job describing. If someone wants to be admitted to the program, is there any specific person they should call or be able to talk to?

> Yes, we have the contact [shows number on page] - the Admissions Coordinator.

[Michelle] Do Veterans typically self-refer? What does that process look like?

> No - most of our patients come from the inpatient unit [at the VAMC]. Pre-covid - it just depends on where we are with covid - we can go back to taking patients
> from the community, but they usually still have to go through the [unintelligible - VAMC unit?], covid has kind of changed things, but the vast majority of our
> patients come from the hospital.

[Nick] How would you say most people find out about the community living center? [Explained that we've seen that word of mouth has been very important for other kinds of facilities]

> Probably from the in-patient social workers. [About word of mouth] That's true, pre-covid we did do a few outreach [events] - mostly hospital based outreach, not really way out in 
> the community anywhere. In the hospital, more geared towards making sure providers and other people who refer here were aware of everything that we offered, [for example]
> our short-term rehabilitation is a newer program for us, and not everyone had that much information about that part of the program, which is why we highlighted
> it on the page a little bit more. But yes there's a word of mouth component.

[Nick] So someone would have to be referred by a third party, or is someone able to call and start the admissions process themselves?

> Not right now, our admissions for our short-stay rehab program is from the hospital.

[Nick] Are there any specific elegibility requirements for this facility that might not be present for other community living centers?

> No. [Nick gives example of spinal cord injury] We have a large spinal cord injury unit at the hospital, so we really don't do that at the clc.

[Michelle] Is a typical patient someone who has had [example procedures] and then needs a transition to get back home, is that the ususaly scenario?

> Not often, we have an acute rehab program here at this facility, so alot of [those kinds of things] go to those facilities at the hospital.

[Nick] If you were updated the site, is there anything in particular you would want people to know before coming to the facility?

> Right now, we're not currently taking long-stay as an admission in our facility. That's why we mostly focused on our short-stay rehab program. We still actually
> have a long-term care program, and long-stay residency, but we're not actively admitting long-stay at this time.

[Nick] Is there an average length of stay for the short-term stay?

> [Searches for info] Our average length of stay is usually pretty short, it's somehwere around two weeks, but I can get you a more exact...we try to keep it to three 
> months or less, but I think we're significantly less than that. Year-to-date for this year [2021], average length of stay is 18 days.

[Michelle] Will you return to admissions for long-term, is that like a capacity thing?

> It's not a capacity thing no, that's an option we're looking at returning to but we're not there yet. We don't have anything definitive on that yet.

[Nick] Have there every been any services that people have requested that are not offered at this location?

> Sometimes people want long-stay, but we're no actively admitting so, there's only under circumstances that we've taken on a long-stay patient. We're looking at other things we could potentially do that are like specific focus, like STIs. We have a robust STI program, and a rehab, and poly-rehab program here, so some of the things you would normally see clcs in other areas doing, it's not as much of an option for us because of the other services that are already being offered in other parts of the hospital.
