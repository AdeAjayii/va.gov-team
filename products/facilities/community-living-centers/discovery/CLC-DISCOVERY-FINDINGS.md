Community Living Centers deliver nursing home level of care, and they can be a temporary or permanent home. They provide a variety of services, from short-term nursing, rehabilitation, and hospice care, to long-term assisted living care.

Community Living Centers fall onto the VA continuum of mental health care, as one of the main forms of inpatient care available in the VA system, and are intended for patients requiring full-time access to assisted living services and bedside care. Whereas domiciliary facilities require residents to be indpendent with their activities of daily living (ADLs), CLC facilities do not, and residents who require help bathing or getting dressed, for example, can receive help here.

### CLC facilities and services

#### The facilities

- What are they?
  - ClCs are short-term and long-term residential facilities intended for Veterans who require assistance with their activities of daily living (ADLs). They are designed to look more like actual homes or small neighborhoods, rather than dormatories, in order to provide a greater level of comfort to elderly patients.
- Where are they located?
- How to people refer to them?

#### The services

- Healthcare provided
  - Community Living Centers are intended to help treat Veterans with chronic stable conditions, and who need assistance with daily living activities. 

### The referral process

- How are Veterans referred?
- Who can Veterans contact directly?
- What are the admissions requirements?
  - Admissions requirements may vary slightly depending on the location, but they include:
    - Veteran must be enrolled in VA health care
    - Veteran must be medically and psychiatrically stable (medical needs and conditions may change over a long-term stay, but should be stable/manageable on entry)
    - the primary services required, anticipated length of stay, anticipated discharge disposition, and priority for CLC services must be documented
- Any special elegibility requirements?
