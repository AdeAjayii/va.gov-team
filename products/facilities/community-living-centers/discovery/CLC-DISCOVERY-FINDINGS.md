Community Living Centers deliver nursing home level of care, and they can be a temporary or permanent home. They provide a variety of services, from short-term nursing, rehabilitation, and hospice care, to long-term assisted living care.

Community Living Centers fall onto the VA continuum of mental health care, as one of the main forms of inpatient care available in the VA system, and are intended for patients requiring full-time access to assisted living services and bedside care. Whereas domiciliary facilities require residents to be indpendent with their activities of daily living (ADLs), CLC facilities do not, and residents who require help bathing or getting dressed, for example, can receive help here.

### CLC facilities and services

#### The facilities

- What are they?
  - ClCs are short-term and long-term residential facilities intended for Veterans who require assistance with their activities of daily living (ADLs). They are designed to look more like actual homes or small neighborhoods (ex: [Orlando CLC](https://www.orlando.va.gov/services/CLC_Pictures.asp)), more so than dormatories, in order to provide a greater level of comfort to elderly patients.
- Where are they located?
  - Community Living Centers are usually located on VAMC campuses, or in proximity, in order to provide residents with 24/7 access to medical care. A VA health care system may also contract with community nursing home in the area via the Community Nursing Home Program (CNH Program).
- How to people refer to them?

#### The services

- Healthcare provided
  - Community Living Centers are intended to help treat Veterans with chronic stable conditions, and who need assistance with daily living activities. Services include short and long-term nursing care, rehabilitiation care, respite care, pallative care, and hospice care. Available services may vary slightly from location to location depending on the purpose of the facility (ex: [Palo Alto](https://www.paloalto.va.gov/clc.asp) focusing on pallative, hospice, and sub-acute care, vs [Orlando](https://www.orlando.va.gov/services/CLC.asp) offering services related to spinal cord injury specifically).

### The referral process

- How are Veterans referred?
  - Veterans can be referred through their primary health care provider, their social case managers, representatives of VA Community Resource and Referral Centers (CRRCs), and via self-referral by calling the facility directly (a VA health care representative must make the referral if the CLC residency is intended to at VA's expense (see [CLC FAQs](https://www.paloalto.va.gov/clcfaq.asp)).
- Who can Veterans contact directly?
- What are the admissions requirements?
  - Admissions requirements may vary slightly depending on the location, but they include:
    - Veteran must be enrolled in VA health care
    - Veteran must be medically and psychiatrically stable on entry
    - the primary services required, anticipated length of stay, anticipated discharge disposition, and priority for CLC services must be documented
- Any special elegibility requirements?
  - Service connected status, level of disability, and income are all factors in determining the amount of copay a Veteran is responsible for.
