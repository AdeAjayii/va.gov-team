# Research Plan: Community Care Manager Interviews 

**September - October 2020 Discovery**<br>

## Goals

- Understand the current data & process that a community care request manager uses to process Veteran's community care requests
- Understand/gather feedback (where possible) about the VAOS requests for community care coming into Community Care request manages 
- In addition, and more specific to the Facility Locator team, we want to understand how and where Community Care Request managers search for type of care/specialties and providers. 

The VAOS team and the Facility Locator team will both benefit from understanding the type of data Request Manager get and use to process a community care request.  


### Research questions

Based on VAOS specialties (suggest Food/Nutrition/Dietary, Primary Care and Audiology) and non-VAOS specialties (suggest Chiropractor and Dermatology):

- How does a community care request get processed by Request managers once it is received in Schedule Manager?
   - What are the different systems a Scheduler uses to process a community care request?
- What type of data is a Request manager looking for from a Veteran when processing community care requests?
- What information do you see from the VAOS request? Of that information, what do you use? What is helpful?
- How do you search for type of care/specialities? Where do you search for that data + providers?
   - What words/categories are used by the schedulers when searching?
   - Which specialties are the most commonly searched? Rarely searched? Never searched?
- What search parameters do they use to identify the appropriate community care provider?
   - What are their expectations for search results (such as the number of results and distance/drive time)?
   - What happens if no providers meet the criteria?
- How do they handle naming ( individual provider name vs group practice name)?
- If you could change anything about community care online scheduling through VAOS what would it be?
- If the schedulers are able to share anecdotal experience, we'd love to know what factors are important to a Veteran so that we can present Facility Locator Community care provider search results accordingly.

### Hypothesis 

Current clients have a favorable view of Vet Centers and the services that they offer and view them as distinct entities from other VA facilities. 

## Method

Qualitative research interviews via Zoom.
