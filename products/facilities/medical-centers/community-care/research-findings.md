# Research Findings: Community Care Managers Study

**VAOS, Facility Locator**<br>

11/25/2020

## Research Goals 

- Understand the current data & process that a community care request manager uses to process Veteran's community care requests
- Understand/gather feedback (where possible) about the VAOS requests for community care coming into Community Care request manages
- In addition, and more specific to the Facility Locator team, we want to understand how and where Community Care Request managers search for type of care/specialties and providers.
- The VAOS team and the Facility Locator team will both benefit from understanding the type of data Community Care Request managers get and use to process a community care request.

Prior to the study, we hypothesized that by understanding how Community Care schedulers use systems to manually process specific requests, and how they search for care providers on behalf of Veterans, we can better understand how to automate/simplify this search experience on Facility locator and VAOS.

## Research Methodology 

Remote, moderated sessions were conducted via Teams for generative questioning.

### Who we talked to
8 Participants:
* 7 Community Care Managers (schedulers)
* 1 Supervisor who manages schedulers

### Research Questions

- How does a community care request get processed by Community Care Request managers once it is received in Schedule Manager?
   - What are the different systems a Scheduler uses to process a community care request?
- What type of data is a Request manager looking for from a Veteran when processing community care requests?
- What information do you see from the VAOS request? Of that information, what do you use? What is helpful?
- How do you search for type of care/specialities? Where do you search for that data + providers?
   - What words/categories are used by the schedulers when searching?
- What search parameters do Community Care Request managers use to identify the appropriate community care provider?
   - What are community care managers' expectations for search results (such as the number of results and distance/drive time) vs. reality?
    - Does that align with Veterans' expectations?
   - What happens if no providers meet the criteria?
- What do those search results look like, what is useful to schedule the appointment, and what do schedulers convey to the Veterans about the provider? And what is a waste of time (unnecessary/confusing)?
- If you could change anything about community care online scheduling through VAOS what would it be?
- If the community care managers are able to share anecdotal experience, we'd love to know what factors are important to a Veteran so that we can present Facility Locator Community care provider search results accordingly.

## Findings

### Findings by Hypothesis

__We can understand how to simplify the search experience in Facility Locator.__

Finding: __Partially True__
* Sub-specialties: Most Community Care Managers do not think that sub-specialties are something most Veterans understand. They might know a term such as podiatry or cardiology, but the sub-categories are often beyond laymen's terms. 
* Type-ahead can also be problematic due to unfamiliarity with search terms. 
* As a separate issue (but which impacts the quality of Facility Locator search results), there are gaps in provider data in PPMS. Facility Locator depends on PPMS for Community Care search results. See VAOS findings below for further details. 

__We can understand how to simplify the search experience in VAOS.__

Finding: __True__
* Based on feedback from Community Care managers, there are provider data gaps in PPMS. Incorrect or incomplete data in PPMS requires CCMs to use other tools, to find the correct Community Care providers. Searching by Google or making calls to providers are common methods in scheduling with providers.

### Key Findings

1. 5 out of 7 Community Care managers, sub-specialties are not something most Veterans understand.
2. 1 out of 7 CCM stated that they prefer to help them find the sub-specialty ("We'll do that.").
3. According to another CCM, the use of the Service Type text field by the Veteran is problematic due to spelling typos.
4. 6 out of 7 CCMs stated that they use Google to find complete and updated information about providers. 
5. 5 out of 7 CCMs stated that they call providers to validate information found on PPMS and seek information that is missing. 
6. 2 out of 7 CCMs use a self-created spreadsheet of providers with validated provider information.

### Details of Findings

#### 1. 5 out of 7 Community Care managers stated sub-specialties are not something most Veterans understand.
Several CCMs called out the medical-specific nuances of sub-specialty terms that Veterans must choose:
> The average Veteran isn’t going to know the difference between a sports podiatrist and foot/ankle podiatrist. If you’re trying to put the subspecs in for the Veterans, most won’t know the difference.

> If i’m just looking for a cardiologist I can’t find the layman's term. This is not to their reading/interpretation level. 

Another CCM, when asked if Veterans understand sub-specialties:
> No, they don't. I used to be the oncology scheduler, and I can’t tell you how many Veterans I called from Oncology and they didn’t know what that term meant.

#### 2. One CCM stated that they would prefer to do the work of selecting a sub-specialty for the Veteran.
> Veterans don’t know what those terms mean. There doesn't need to be any subcategories - they can just be generic. We’ll provide that.

#### 3. According to another CCM, the use of the Service Type text field by the Veteran is problematic due to spelling typos. 
If a Veteran happens to know sub-specialty terms, using the type-ahead field under Service Type can lead to misspellings, which also negatively impact search results: 
> I can tell you this will cause problems. Mistyping Chiro is an example.

#### 4. 6 out of 7 CCMs stated that they use Google to find complete and updated information about providers.
Several mentioned gaps in provider data, such as an outdated phone number or address:
> Sometimes the provider has moved or is no longer affiliated. Sometimes the change happened 3-4 yrs ago but is still in the system. I have to Google to find the info I need.

One stated that their new partner finds providers listed under "multi-specialty":
> Our new partner has listed a lot under multi-specialty, so it’s sometimes a guessing game, or you have to Google.

One CCM mentioned the need to use Google to find names of clinics:
> Most patients know the practice name, not the provider name. We only get the provider name so we use Google for the clinic name.

#### 5. 5 out of 7 CCMs stated that they call providers to validate information found on PPMS, and seek information that is missing.
One CCM stated the importance of knowing whether a provider is accepting new patients: 
> It's important to know if they are accepting new patients. This doesn’t reflect that. You really have to call every provider, which is very time consuming.

Another CCM mentioned the need for fax numbers:
> A lot of times fax numbers aren’t in PPMS. A lot of times fax numbers aren’t in PPMS. We use that for transmitting referrals. If it was there, that’d be one less call we’d have to make to the providers

#### 6. 2 CCMs use a self-created spreadsheet of providers with all of the complete and correct provider information.
Detail & Quotes


## Additional Insights

1. All Community Care Managers interviewed call the Veteran at some point in the scheduling process, and many do so once they receive the scheduling request. Veterans are hard to get ahold of. “Biggest challenge is getting ahold of these guys and getting them scheduled.”

2. CCMs like the PPMS update that shows phone, fax, and local address. While PPMS displays provider names, CCMs prefer to have the names of the clinics as well. They find by using Google. 

3. CCMs would also like to know if providers are accepting new patients.

4. One CCM had a list of 12 data issues for the provider network to correct. It usually takes two weeks for the provider network to make the corrections.

5. CCMs mentioned the pain of documenting and updating an appointment in multiple systems.

6. Several CCMs stated that there is confusion from Veterans on which urgent care to use. Facilities may not know how to bill for VA care properly. Half the time this means the veteran ends up paying out of pocket. Marking them as “preferred providers” would be helpful. 

7. Search terms: It is difficult for CCMs to figure out the search terms. CCMs rely on past success/talking to each other/word of mouth.

8. Relationships with vendors are key to efficiency for CCMs. They follow a certain process that their vendors understand. This can also limit number of vendors available, however.


## Recommendations

__Facility Locator__
* Remove the sub-specialties found under Service Type. Doing so will simplify the search for the Veteran, while moving the sub-specialty decision-making to the Community Care Manager, who understands the sub-specialties.
* Refrain from using type-ahead boxes and use drop-down menus for selection instead. Type-ahead requires the Veteran to know the term they are searching for and the correct way to spell it, in order to see results.
* If there are certain sub-specialties that must be displayed, use layman's terms when possible to avoid confusion, or provide explanations for the terms. 

__VA Online Scheduling__
* As part of improving the VA Online Scheduling experience
   * Improve the quality of existing provider data in PPMS such as updated phone numbers, addresses, in/out of network, and fax numbers.
   * Add provider data that will help CCMs minimize the use of search tools outside of the system. Provider data include gender, accepting new patients, and name of clinic. 
   * Consider finding ways to automate the screening question process, which is completed by CCMs via phone call with the Veteran.

## Next Steps

* Implement design recommendations.
* Share relevant findings with other teams and stakeholders.
