VA police transparency 

### Overview
The VA Police are the armed and uniformed federal law enforcement service of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) who are responsible for the protection of VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) and other health care facilities and support VA’s National Cemetery Administration (NCA) and Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), including locations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. There is a legislative requirement to make their information available to Veterans and the public, including police activity and contact information. 

### Background
- VA Police have the authority to enforce Federal laws (to include using the Assimilated Crime Statue, 18 United States Code 13) concerning persons on Department property for offenses committed on property, and to make arrests on warrants issued by a competent judicial authority.
- Local forces have a rank structure similar to local police with roles that range from sergeant to chief. 
- The VA Police also have groups of specialty jobs or service elements, such as K-9, bicycle, and motorcycle patrols.
- The VA Police have several divisions and operate separately but alongside the VA Law Enforcement Training Center (VA LETC) under the umbrella of the [Office of Security and Law Enforcement](https://www.osp.va.gov/Security_and_Law_Enforcement.asp). 
- The VA Police partner with local law enforcement and have written agreements which outline how community agencies respond to crimes that happen on VA property. They conduct joint training, including active threat drills, crisis intervention training, and disaster response.
- VA Police Officers truly understand Veterans because most of them have also served in the military and in combat.
- Services include Law enforcement, criminal investigations and crime prevention, exterior and interior patrols, physical security and workplace violence prevention
- They are 
- An article from 2020 indicated there are 5,000 VA police officers nationwide and 150 VA police chiefs
  - Example: The Greater Los Angeles VA Police Department has over 88 appointed law enforcement officers with several enforcement teams such as: Vehicle Patrol, Bicycle Patrol, Traffic Enforcement, Criminal Investigations and Narcotics enforcement, Veterans Mental Evaluation Team (VMET), Training and Support Services. 
- All VA police officers will be using body-worn and in-car cameras by the end of 2023 (legislative mandate)

## Problem Statement
Legislation passed in 2022 requires VAMC websites to include data about VA police activity.
Deadline: One year after the enactment (December 2022), the Secretary shall report to Congress on the implementation of all provisions of amendments to 38 USC 902, which includes the publishing of arrest and ticketing data.

**How might we** 
- help connect Veterans to VA police when they need help with safety or security matters
- provide access to facility-level police activity, such as arrests, tickets, use of force, internal investigations, complaints, and disciplinary actions
- make direct contact information for the police force available so that employees and the public can request more information about VA police activity
