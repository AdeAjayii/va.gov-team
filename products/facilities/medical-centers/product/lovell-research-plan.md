[PRE-REVIEW]

# Research Plan for Facilities, Lovell Federal Testing, May 2022

## Background
The Lovell Federal Facility services both VA beneficiaries as well as DoD/TRICARE beneficiaries.

However, the unauthenticated top tasks for these beneficiaries are accomplished in separate locations, making the experience confusing. Additionally, there is content that is specific to each type of location that needs to be separated for clarity and conciseness.

Veterans are already familiar with the modernized location design, however, the split between the VA beneficiaries locations and content, and the DoD/TRICARE beneficiaries locations and content will be a new experience for them.

Aging
* Managing my declining health (Moment that Matters)

## Research Goals	

The primary goals of this research are to determine:
* Whether Veterans understand the informational alert and switching between beneficiary types.
* Whether DoD service members understand that they are TRICARE beneficiaries.
* Whether VA beneficiaries understand that TRICARE information isn’t right for them.

### Outcome

This research will help to determine whether the design solution is understood by Veterans, or if future iterations are needed.

### Research questions

Whether Veterans understand the informational alert and switching between beneficiary types.
* You’ve arrived at this location page through a Google Search. As an active duty service member, where would you go to navigate to the information that’s relevant to you?

Whether Veterans understand that they are TRICARE beneficiaries.
* You are a retired service member, 

Whether VA beneficiaries understand that TRICARE information isn’t right for them.
* You know that you’re looking for the Lovell VA Federal Health Care Center. As a VA beneficiary, are you on the page of information that’s directed to VA beneficiaries?

### Hypothesis

We already know that Veterans are familiar with a location experience that does not separate out locations by the type of beneficiary you are.

* I believe users will not recognize themselves as TRICARE beneficiaries, causing some confusion around what information is intended for them.
* I believe that users will overlook the informational alert, causing them to miss the “switcher” functionality if they do end up on the location page for a different beneficiary.
* I believe users will like the concept of the information being more clearly defined by their beneficiary type, making top tasks easier and more clear.

Veterans are familiar with a location experience that does not separate the experience by beneficiary, and by doing so, it creates inconsistency in the experience and Veterans may not recognize the type of beneficiary they are.

## Method	
Research Method:
* Usability testing. Designs have been reviewed by the collaboration cycle, and this method will help to determine whether the designs are understood by Veterans.

Includes task flows from specific starting points:
* Lovell VA beneficiary system page (https://preview.uxpin.com/d55fbe11583adc1a1d7b6e2bafde9ef560c7bf36#/pages/148503607/simulate/sitemap?mode=i) 
* Lovell TRICARE beneficiary system page  (https://preview.uxpin.com/d55fbe11583adc1a1d7b6e2bafde9ef560c7bf36#/pages/148524850/simulate/sitemap?mode=i) 
* VA location (https://preview.uxpin.com/d55fbe11583adc1a1d7b6e2bafde9ef560c7bf36#/pages/148538622/simulate/sitemap?mode=i)
