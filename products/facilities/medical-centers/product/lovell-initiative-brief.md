# Initiative Brief Template (WIP)
## Product: VAMC pages
### Initiative: Lovell Federal health care

**This initiative aligns with the following OCTO-DE's mission and goals**
- Veterans, active duty service members and their families can find accurate halth service information for local facilities
- Veterans can manage their health services online. 
- Connect Veterans with the services they need.

## Background

The VAMC modernized websites were designed to provide the top tasks and content that Veterans, families, and caregivers need most to prepare to visit a VA medical facility  including location information, available health and social services, patient registration, and other acocount needs. 

## Problem

The Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center has a combined mission to serve Veterans as well as active duty military, their family members, and military retirees. The center also cares for an estimated 40,000 Navy recruits who prepare for military service at Recruit Training Command at Naval Station Great Lakes.

Lovell health care system includes locations which serve both Veterans and active duty personnel as well as facilities which serve only one or the other. 
- Captain James A. Lovell Federal Health Care Center (serves both Veterans and active duty personnel)
- Evanston VA Clinic (serves Veterans only)
- Kenosha VA Clinic (serves Veterans only)
- McHenry VA Clinic (serves Veterans only)
- USS Osborne Dental Clinic (serves only enlisted recruits)
- USS Red Rover (serves only enlisted recruits)
- USS Tranquility (serves only recruits and active duty)
- Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Medical and Dental Clinic (serves only active duty, DOD Civilians (appropriated & non-appropriated fund) and dependents)

This means we need the following iterations 
- the existing system home page must support the needs of Veterans _and service members_
- a version of the existing facility home page to support the needs of Veterans _and service members_
- a version of the existing facility home page to support the needs of _service members only_

### Current teamsite experience

## Desired User Outcomes
- Whether I am a Veteran, active duty service member or family member receiving care at Lovell Federal Health Care, I need a seamless online experience. 
  - Top task buttons and other links should direct me to the appropriate Veteran or Department of Defense portal or page.  

## Undesired User Outcomes
  - An individual viewing a Lovell facility or system page is confused about wherther or not that facility serves him/her. 
  - A Veteran, active duty service member or family member is given the wrong information or misdirected to the wrong portal or online experience. 

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Existing Teamsite pages can be replaced with modernized pages on VA.gov

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
