Hello [Name],

I work with Dave Conlon on the VA.gov Facilities product team. We’re in the process of preparing to redesign Mobile Clinic websites and as with all our product improvement initiatives, we first want to learn from the people who manage and use them everyday. We’re looking to spend about an hour learning about Mobile Clinics and what an ideal new website would look like for you. 

Are you available at any of the times below to hop on Zoom with us for a chat? If, not let me know when would be a good time.

Also, feel free to let me know if there’s someone else that you think we should talk to.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
