# VAMC VHA Mobile Redesign - Discovery

## Research goals

To understand how mobile clinics are being used across the country, so that we accurately represent them on VA.gov facility web pages.

## Methodology

1-hour moderated group interviews over Teamsite. 

## Who we spoke with

We interviewed 14 VA employees, in various roles who run and manage the MMU programs and services:
 - 2 - Emergency managers
 - 6 - Health programs and operations management 
(physicians, nurses and clinic managers)

As well as those who publicize MMU events and information to Veterans:
 - 7 - Public Affairs and communications officers
 - 1- Veteran outreach coordinator



## Research findings

### 1. Mobile clinics, events and services will not be adequately represented by the current model of 1 webpage per vehicle. 


- A mobile asset may be owned by a particular facility but it's custodianship falls under emergency management who can deploy it at any time, for different needs, crossing health system and catchment area borders. 
- Mobile clinics, MMUs, MUVs vary widely in their use and purpose.

    Non-emergency:
    - Used as primary care clinics to offer scheduled appointments by a predictable schedule
    - Used as dedicated space for a CBOC to deliver scheduled specialty care; cardiology
    - Ability to connect to a secure weblink as one reason for choice of location
    - Used as private space for counseling during planned outreach events
    - Walk-in services during a planned event

    During emergency response:
    - Used to deliver primary care in high visibility location 
    - Used to deliver food, showers, mental health counseling
    - Used by VHA staff for counseling even when typically staffed by Mobile Vet Center


   #### Recommendation: 

   - Offer multiple solutions driven by the service being offered, e.g.
    -  Recurring and scheduled primary = dedicated webpage (current VAMC)
    -  Temporary event or emergency response = events pages
    -  Specialty service offered by an MMU = service accordion under a facility page

### 2. PAOs are apprehensive or resistant to adopting upgraded websites

- PAO staffing and capabilities vary widely across VISNs, systems, and facilities. Some PAOs don’t feel adequately staffed or trained or supported to maintain a website. Current web solutions don’t factor in this variability. 
- PAOs prefer to update their facilities' Facebook pages than their current official website.

   #### Recommendation: 

   - More discovery work to understand PAO tools, processes, needs and pain points. 
   - Find ways to improve relationships with PAOs, and create solutions that take their needs into account.

### 3. Coordination, collaboration and communication between VHA and Vet Centers is inconsistent at best.

- MMUs and MVCs (Mobile Vet Centers) can be used and deployed interchangeably for different situations and may be parked next to each other without the other knowing. VA staff that we interviewed report poor collaboration between VHA and Vet Centers, explaining how inconsistent it is across the country and even hinting at adversarial in some cases. This is not good for the Veteran or VA staff. This means Veterans are not being effectively routed to potential care and benefits.
- In past research, Vet Center staff voiced concerns over the negative relationship between VHA and Vet Center. In this study, VHA staff volunteered the same concern.
- Health systems where VHA and VC work together effectively, like Orlando, have acknowledged the issue and put practices in place to rectify it. However, this scenario seems to be an outlier, due to considerable concerted effort by motivated staff, rather than the VA norm.
- In past research, Veterans expressed anger and resentment that they were not informed of Vet Center mental health care options by their VHA mental health providers.

   #### Recommendation: 

   - More research is needed to understand the source of the problem and to identify potential downstream effects that it may be causing Veterans and staff.
