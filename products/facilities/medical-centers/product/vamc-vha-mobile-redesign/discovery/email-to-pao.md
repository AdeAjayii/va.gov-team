Requesting mobile clinic information for webpage redesign

## Body:

Hello [Name], 

I work with Dave Conlon on the VA.gov Facilities product team. We’re preparing to redesign mobile clinic webpages and as with all our product improvement initiatives, we like to start with research first. We want to learn from people who manage and work with mobile clinics every day. 

What we’re looking to learn:

- Which Veteran populations use your mobile clinic(s)
- How Veterans learn about hours, locations, etc. today
- Services provided by your mobile clinic 
- Appointments, scheduling and eligibility 
- Webpage improvements that you'd like to see

Are you available next week to chat for about an hour?  Also, let me know if there’s someone else that you think would be better suited to help us answer these questions.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your help,
