# VAMC VHA Mobile clinic / MMU: Research and Design

## [Initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/initiative-brief.md)

## Discovery

### Phase 1 

To understand how mobile clinics are being used across the country, so that we accurately represent them on VA.gov facility web pages.
 - [Research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/research-findings.md)

## Design

### Phase 2

#### Final design
 - [Prototype in UXPin - Oct 2021](https://preview.uxpin.com/20fd05cf8e86ce628f0c813166424d0a6ca38bfd#/pages/142019860/documentation/sitemap)
 - [UXPin file (.UXP)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/design/Mobile%20Clinic%20Schedule%20Section.uxp)
 - [Research Findings - Design Validation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery-round-2/research-findings.md) 
   - Purpose: to validate or invalidate the MVP design of the new schedule section for use by mobile clinic/MMU facility types: 
     - 1) Identify problems with design 
     - 2) Discover opportunities to consider for future iterations. 
       - **Note:** The final design is the MVP solution, "smallest slice", that unblocks health systems to publish mobile clinic facility pages with multiple schedules but **does not address** all the use cases uncovered in discovery as detailed in this document.

#### Round 2
   - [Round 2 - Mural exploration of design solutions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/files/MMU-Discovery-Phase-3.pdf)
     
#### Round 1    
   - [Synthesis board in Mural with MMU/Mobile uses cases & Round 1 design](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/files/MMU-Discovery-Phase-2.pdf) - Collection of MMU use cases from interviews with PAOs, emergency management and clinical staff. On the right side of the Mural, is a first round of design solutions/exploration for the various use cases.
