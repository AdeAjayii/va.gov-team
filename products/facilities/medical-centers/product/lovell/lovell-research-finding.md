# Research Goals ✅
The Lovell Federal Facility services both VA beneficiaries as well as DoD/TRICARE beneficiaries. However, the unauthenticated top tasks for these beneficiaries are accomplished in separate locations, making the experience confusing. Additionally, there is content that is specific to each type of location that needs to be separated for clarity and conciseness.

The legacy Lovell website combines the VA & TRICARE information in a single site. The team created a prototype that splits VA & TRICARE information into two separate sites in the modernized VAMC template. The two sites are connected by informational alerts that allow users to switch back and forth between between the TRICARE and VA versions of the page they are on.

This bespoke health care system research is building upon earlier VAMC research.

# Research Questions ✅

1. Will Veterans and dual-eligible Veterans know where they can receive care at Lovell Federal Health Care Center?
2. Will participants notice and understand the informational alert?
3. Will dual-eligible Veterans understand when to use the VA health care experience vs. the TRICARE health care experience?

# Methodology ✅

* Usability testing using UXPin
* We did not test with screen readers because the designs are in UXPin, the design has been reviewed by the collaboration cycle, and the foundation of the VAMC pages have already been tested
* Not testing on mobile because the VAMC pages have already been tested on mobile during the VAMC redesign testing

Includes task flows from specific starting points:
* [Lovell VA beneficiary system page](https://preview.uxpin.com/85c0c5e5501b4c222f4d37bfdd4d6eb59dd93386#/pages/150395163/simulate/no-panels) 
* [Lovell TRICARE beneficiary system page](https://preview.uxpin.com/85c0c5e5501b4c222f4d37bfdd4d6eb59dd93386#/pages/150395168/simulate/no-panels)
* [VA Lovell location](https://preview.uxpin.com/85c0c5e5501b4c222f4d37bfdd4d6eb59dd93386#/pages/150395164/simulate/no-panels) 
* [TRICARE Lovell location](https://preview.uxpin.com/85c0c5e5501b4c222f4d37bfdd4d6eb59dd93386#/pages/150395169/simulate/no-panels)

# Hypotheses and Conclusions ✅

We already know that Veterans are familiar with a location experience that does not separate out locations by type of beneficiary.
We already know that research has been conducted on the existing VAMC experience.

* Veterans and dual-eligible Veterans will be able to identify whether the page they are on is for VA or TRICARE health care beneficiaries.
  * NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION - Only a few participants successfully identified the distinction between VA and TRICARE. Several participants attempted to use site features that were not functional in the prototype that led to artifical dead ends. 
* The informational alerts helps Veterans and dual-eligible Veterans understand whether they're viewing VA or TRICARE health information, and to navigate to the other experience, if desired.
  * FALSE - Across all participants and tasks, the informational alert was only noticed only 7/22 times = 32% success rate

# Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._
