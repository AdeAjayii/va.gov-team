# Audit VAMC non-clinical service taxonomy

This work [Audit spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HZt-rwbICniW6jMComBhW4DplcGx9Ooy/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=109024407558026969388&rtpof=true&sd=true) is for Github issue [#30839](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/30839#issuecomment-947816525)

## Scope of work
This is a first draft audit of non-clinical VHA services referenced on VAMC pages. It also includes some top task/services referenced on the VA.gov homepage as well as some top call center call topics. The services identified should serve as hypotheses to be tested for plain language and in wayfinding user tests (e.g. a tree test, card sorts) to understand how Veterans might expect to find them. 

## Definition of a service
For purposes of uncovering new and future services, this audit assumes that common Veteran tasks will need to become or mapped to services in order to be found. Veteran tasks were identified in the “New Services” tab if there wasn’t an obvious, existing service taxon with which it could be associated but a corresponding person or process is offered or required by the VA in order to accomplish it. In other words, I need to do a thing and the VA offers a phone, feature, or person (service) to help me do that thing.
