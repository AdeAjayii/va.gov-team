## VA Health Connect Discovery - Research Findings

Discovery for issue [#27688](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/27688). New options for contacting the VA are becoming available and need to be added to the VAMC pages. Before we can determine the right experience for Veterans, we need to understand both the individual options and the landscape.

- Clinical contact center
- 24 hours live by phone
- Regional phone numbers (mapped to health system)
- slow roll-out, will be available nationwide
- How does VA Health Connect differ from "teleurgent care line" which appears on Pittsburgh's operating status page? (see below)

#### Other methods of communication available to Veterans : 

- [VA Secure Messaging](https://www.va.gov/health-care/secure-messaging/)
- [Secure Messaging FAQ](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/secure-messaging-general-faqs)
- Health chat
- in-person conversation


### Research Goals

Get clarity on when to use this method (from VA perspective) so that we can determine the best method for researching Veteran expectations about their communication options and begin considering the best way to present the information that Veterans need.


### Methodology

Informational interview with secure messaging SME(s) over Microsoft Team.


### Questions

- **What is the VA Health Connect?**
- **Where does this product fit into the Veteran journey?** ([Patient Experience journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Patient%20Experience%20Journey%20Map.pdf) || [Veteran journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf))
- **How has/ how will a Veteran get routed to this call center?**
- **What is a typical use case for this product?**
  - **Are there any other use cases, or edge cases?**
- **How would this number phone number ideally be labeled?**
  - **Where did the name come from?**
- **Why would a Veteran use this line over Teleurgent Care Line 1-833-835-3874?** 
- **Why would a Veteran use this line over Telephone Care 866-482-7488?**
- **Why would a Veteran use this line over National Veterans Helpline?**
- **Why would a Veteran use this line over National Veterans Patient Locator?**
- **Why would a Veteran use this, as opposed to something like [Health Chat]
- **What does a Veteran need to know about VA Health Connect?**
- **Is there a phone tree that call centers will use to route Veterans to from this line?**
  - **Is this something that we'd be able to get access to?**
- **Is there anything else that you think that we or Veterans need to know that I haven't already asked you?**

## SME Interview(s)

- **SME:** Rick (Richard) Fox:

-   PAO, Communications Director VHA

-   Veteran 

-   Used to work at Heinz as PAO, content editor

- **Stakeholders:** 

- Susan Clinker: director of clinical contact center and modernization
- Susan Kirsch: Acting Deputy Under Secretary (Rick's boss)
- Jenny Heiland-Luedtke: Deputy Director VHA

## FINDINGS


### STAKEHOLDER GOALS:

-   Get new VA Health Connect number on Fac Loc for VISN 8 facilities by Dec 31st 

### WHY ARE WE DOING THIS:

Clinical Contact Center & Modernization and Office of Comm Care: 
   -   Reduce emergent care cost for urgent care use cases 
   -   Consolidate multiple call centers into a multi-use contact center that can offer help in scheduling, offer clinical triage, Rx refills and virtual visits
   -   Give Veterans more access to care

### RISKS - PROBLEMS THIS INITIATIVE CAN CREATE FOR VETERANS 

-   This number does NOT replace the existing "main number" because it can't handle all types of calls. Having two "main numbers" in addition to Mental Health phone on Facility Locator adds confusion and cognitive load. Setting expectations of what this number is for is crucial.

-   During the day calls are handled by PAC team, after hours by Clinical Contact Center which seem to "compete" with each other. Does this create a situation where care decisions are not about what's best for the Veteran but instead which department gets credit for the "conversion"?

-   Stakeholders don't know how each other's phone numbers work, goals are not aligned, organizational silos are currently surfaced on VA websites and Veterans suffer.  

-   Veteran is left to figure out who to call

-   If we don't update phone numbers on VAMC we will introduce a downstream inconsistency for Veterans to understand how to navigate their own healthcare.

### SUCCESS METRICS

-   How will we know if we are succeeding?

-   Who owns the success metric? Facilities team? VA Health Connect? Are they different or aligned?

### UX RECOMMENDATIONS AT A HIGH LEVEL:

1. Define what success looks like? Are we tracking call volume for numbers before and after for the different numbers if this is a pilot? 
2. Identify other stakeholders need to be identified so that we can sunset numbers that will be redundant.
- Phone number audit to answer the following for VISN 8: 
    - What is the number
    - What call center is this?
    - Who is the stakeholder?
    - Where is it located? 
    - Are they aware of clinical contact center if I call and ask?
    - How are they determining between urgent and emergent care?
3. Prototype new labels: Branded name should not be Veteran facing - All phone labels should concisely describe their purpose, e.g  with verbs and not branded internal names. 
4. Test language with Veterans - Usability test the new phone number in context with other phone numbers to guage clarity and to mitigate adding more noise and confusion

### NEXT STEPS:

-   Rick will send language
-   Facilities Team synthesis to understand the communication options that could be presented to Veterans
-   **NOTE: Keep Lauren in the loop if we decide to reach out to Kathy Frisbee or Nancy Wilck on further Health Chat/Comms work so Lauren is aware of touchpoints between facilities and Office of Connected Care

## Interview Notes
---------------

#### What is the VA Health Connect?

-   Right now Facilities have call centers. One facility might have 8 different call centers and/or contact centers

-   Contact center is defined as a modality to communicate; chat, video, email, etc so its taking that call center and beefing it up

-   ~18 contact centers - HC is meant to "consolidate", but we're not downsizing these call centers into VISN level contact centers, though 1 or 2 may be combined into one contact center. In addition to and to complement in-person care. Reps have access to clinical records. 

-   Launch deadline for every facility is Dec 31st

-   Been working on this since May 2020 but in the works for 4-5 years

-   Want it in Fac Loc in VISN 8 since pilot is live

-   Care available 24/7 but still TBD what is available when. (*for Launch\
    4 key services:

1.  *Scheduling and administrative support: a live human being that answers that has training and ability to handle 

2.  *Live clinical triage

3.  Virtual visits - will schedule same day video connect

4.  Pharmacy services - mostly for refills, but also for preventing ER overuse

#### Eligibility:

Have to be enrolled in health care but not meant to replace PAC team, this is a complement to existing care. PAC teams get very "attached" to their patients. Those not enrolled, would be handled by the HC administrator who is knowledgeable and trained.

#### Long term:

OIT (Shawn Mitz explained to Rick) has invested in this effort with an 8 billion dollar backbone so that it will be standardized, working with EHR to be nationalized by a cisco backbone. Then cloud based software lays overtop the cisco infrastructure.

#### VISN 8 feedback

Feedback is great, but only complaint is that it's not on Facility Locator. Rick is working with Jenny HL to get this on the site and she pushes back saying OIT folks [facilities team] need to see the vision and know how it fits in with the other methods of contact, other numbers. 

Rick: I'm the comms guy. I brought in Jason Dangle, VISN 8 assistant PAO, into the mix. When I was pulled in Aug 2020, VAHC was called CCC, clinical contact center and I got bent out of shape that we had 8 different things called CCC. We spent 8 weeks to rebrand. 

Another initiative is we're working with Community Care. The Emergency Departments (EDs), we're spending 5 billion on ED use. It's sensitive we don't want to take emergency use away from Veterans, but when we have repeat users who use emergency care as their primary care, things like that we're trying to solve.  

Example: We were able to get Veteran on Video Connect who got a spider bite who might have instead used ER. VISN 8 is seeing a reduction in Community Care ED use. Susan Clinker is their director of clinical contact center and modernization. She's giving me real evidence that this works to continue to reduce ER costs. We need to find other ways to get veterans the care they need.


#### How does this differ from the other numbers listed here? Tele-urgent Care Line 1-833-835-3874, or what would it replace?

<img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/j0v4R2dtus_MkL5wdWYNsHBYRML2sMe8hwU2U0SHnwhbyP0LJRKKHemNOa69MwdwHtTRp6v_V_bqB45AudqXFgBerZPWy4PqxY-MPE2sirxTiy37D3X_TcOqOlKNfv9dZK4F2c5K=s0"  alt="[screenshot of teleurgent care line which appears on Pittsburgh's operating status page]" width="40%" height="40%">

I'm not sure, I'm the comms guy, but I believe

-   We'll probably never get rid of Veterans Crisis line

But everything else under that, I don't see why we wouldn't shift to the new 1 number per VISN

-   Tele-urgent care

-   Under emergency medicine - Chad Kessler

-   Change your appointment

-   Patient Locator ("I'm not sure what a Patient Locator is")

-   Pharmacy Refill

-   Telephone Care - that's probably a call center with some sort of nurse triage line that all facilities have and if its not a nurse from VA they are contracted with the same people we contract with for Community Care.

-   Staff Locator - I don't know

-   * National Veterans Helpline

On some cases maybe only 1 of the two services is available on Dec 31st and the rest get replaced slowly

Scenario: Vet from Montana calls outside her VISN

Rick: Rep should be able to still help given that the Cisco/cerner backbone offers the same medical records to the contact center. In the future, the answering party isn't party to PAC ***This is still unclear but Rick feels 90% confident

Mental health call, are the a warm hand-off: 

All warm hand-offs, multiple callers might have multiple issues.They've gone through lengthy process maps. I'm not at the level to know what they'd do. Finding what mistakes were caught during pilot for VISN 8. 

#### Pilots in other VISNs

Pharmacy Support: VISN 10 has 1 pharmacy support for the whole VISN. We're using that as the model for pharmacy support.

Scheduling: VISN 12 all apppoint calls go to Madison, WI.

I don't know but if we have 8 of these different contact centers. Some of them have already consolidated so as we consolidate at the VISN level we'll probably, and I can probably help you get the right person to talk to you. We tried for weeks to get us with the head of VA Health Connect and Susan Klinker from VISN 8 together, we just couldn't get everyone's schedule to work. So, I'm glad this is happening to get the nuts and bolts out of the way. I think it will be a simpler call. 

#### Process Flow - are they available to us?

Sounds like a good idea, I don't know if they are available. 

#### For Vaccines:

Rick worked with Lauren A and Shante during COVID to work on final approved messaging. The call centers get info before VISN directors. We're still figuring out some of that mapping.

VISN 8 Live Site - Orlando - will VAHC # replace main phone?


![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ZXF-hdVRuvksxzZuvfk_0x47Q9_C6VDX67sdi0NX5STwl5MdyT7p5hS_IS9FfVVKrhN1Y7AHbCIGqpFBrOhkLDkBO7tMFL7cRFvDhkBFx77BDBtJVX3-jTG46oha-8wZYNJLRMAt=s0)

That I don't know, I think that would stay the same and having been the facility PAO there's a lot of calls that come in and have nothing to do with what the contact centers are going to be doing, like where do I park. I don't know that our clinical contact centers are going to know that specific info vs details about an appt vs a media call that needs to go to a director. 

The operators need to absolutely know about the clinical contact center, but that would be an interesting question.

I think during business hours it will remain the same for the front desk (main phone number), but after hours when the PAC team is gone for the day and they're just handling the inpatient calls when an outpatient call comes in they would send them to the contact center. That's the intent, for nights, evenings, weekends, and holidays.

Michelle: Makes sense, the PAC team wants to take care of their people during business hours but after hours they still want their people cared for. Maybe under services, where would that belong? Under Telehealth? At either system and facility level. 

For any of them, for after hours support... and list the clinical support. I would think, because a Veteran wouldn't know what a clinical contact center is especially as we start this.

Same goes for emergent care, urgent, we're really trying to jump in. If someone is calling in the middle of the night because that's when they're awake, sure, we want to be able to schedule that appt. But what we're really trying to do is make this convenient and give access when people need it. 

PAOs are often not trained for content editing 

On VISN 8 I'm still not seeing the same page with the phone numbers as Pittsburgh. Let's face it I was the content manager at Heinz, I had zero training, I had no idea how to use Teamsite, no idea what my responsibilities were because there hadn't been a PAO in place for two years when I was hired. And we have that across the country, some are more stable than others. And in some places sometimes its the PAO that's the content manager and others its the dietitian who just became the deputy of whatever this week, the way we hire and promote within the VA, communications is never... I happen to have a masters degree... I happen to have 20 years experience before coming to VA. It doesn't make me super special but I'm not the norm. Like I said, I could have been a dietician last week but because I wanted a promotion to GS12 from their GS11 position and because they had good customer service skills, somebody gave them the job and were told, oh by the way, you're our new content manager.

#### Clicking blue button "Make an Appointment":

Primary care call center: 877-646-4550 < this is not the toll free number for the clinical contact center. This is probably the normal call center during normal business hours and there's probably a way for it to roll over after hours. I'm making some educated guesses.

#### Is it behind the scenes only?

No, it can also be behind the scenes and maybe in the short term but we want it to be the primary go to for high acuity, emergent care or urgent care. If it's 2 in the afternoon it's going to be staffed but if it's after hours or a holiday it's going to roll over that other number. 

How do I talk to someone right now: [I point this out because it's how we handle after hours]

"It doesn't seem particularly user friendly. It doesn't seem intuitive to me. And that's only for an appointment. 'I don't want an appointment, how do I get help right now? I've been trying to get a hold of the PAC team for three weeks but when they return my call I'm at work and I haven't been able to take it, how do I' you know those kind of calls."  

#### The ask:

The phone number that's listed here: <https://www.visn8.va.gov/ccc.asp> on Facility Locator and a quick description of what it is.

[Rick does a Google search for "Orlando VA medical center "clinical contact center""]

#### Checking out Orlando VAMC Teamsite for the VAHC#

<https://www.orlando.va.gov/index.asp>

Michelle: It says in that blue box that it should not be used for emergency situations. So I just want to make sure of the caveats that we need to give. "...virtual care ans support to Veterans enrolled for VA Health Care in Florida, South Georgia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands". Are any of these caveats that we need to give? Or really just this number and after hours support?

Rick: I wish I had an answer, I can only give you my opinion. I think we need some kind of disclaimer like this is after hours support. If we ask the general counsel I'm sure they will say we need to say call 911 for... I know part of the goal is to get people who are using the emergency department inappropriately to use this. So where's the magic wand to move from one to the other. I lean to what you first said, so people can use this in place of an emergency room. because if its after hours and calls the triage line, they almost always automatically tell you to go to the emergency room for anything but the most basic thing because that's CYA. but if they could actually dial this in and get on and actually do a virtual visit. That's what saves the trip. You're probing into the right areas. Unfortunately, I'm the comms guy and I don't know what the clinicians who are involved in this and frankly the people on the operational executive leadership team... I don't know if they have all the answers. But they are the ones that could make these decisions. But I can weigh in and you can weigh in from a communications perspective but operationally only they can tell us what they are trying to achieve.

Rick: So here's their numbers. I don't know where these even take you. I mean, I assume those are national and not Orlando.

Michelle: Oh, that's IRIS. 

Rick: and that's placed right next to... that's Teamsite right? That's the model/template I was using at Heinz.

Is there anything else that you think that we need to know?

I think the biggest thing is that we have two things that we're trying to achieve. 

First and foremost, we have a VISN that's already up and running and we're not communicating well and I know they could use the help yesterday, a month ago. How to we get this on Facility Locator. I would say the sooner we can get this thing with this # for VISN 8 for each site on Facility Locator, and I can get the language, I can get Susan Klinker who's the director over there, and susan hirsch who is my boss that just called to approve the language, and let you guys weight in of course

Number two, this is a question for Jenny as well, when can we get this for the other sites as well. We know we're going to have about 18, the phone numbers are all assigned. 

And then of course what is the vision overall, how does this fit in with VA Health chat. You know frankly, when we hear from VA health chat, we're friends with office of connected care, but my numbers may not be perfect but the comparison is we get 5000 calls a week they might get 30 VA health chats. So the primary focus is a number. And VISN 8 is using VA Health Chat. And they are kind of separate channels too. I don't know if they..I think eventually the people that are chatting could recommend the phone number and maybe with the chat we could do an outbound call to the phone number, I don't know the details but again, when I brought this up with Susan Klinker, she said who cares, let's get the phone number up there.

I don't think our focus is to redesign anything. It's just let's get a phone number up there and put a plan together. So that by Dec 31st when they already go live. I already have a press release. Its already going through the approvals. But we're moving.

What's the timeline for getting the phone number on VISN 8?

Michelle: Facility Locator and VAMC pages?

Rick: Facility Locator is the priority. 

Michelle: The pages are in dual state. I can't give an answer and he's why. We need to identify the data for the facilities first since this is not national. 

Rick: Axure as another complication. Can I give you a manual list of the rites that need it. It's Orlando, Jacksonville, the CBOCs associated with it. 

Michelle: I think we have the list because it's in Drupal. 

Rick: I can let her know that we all agree that this needs to be done we just need to do it right.
