[IN PROGRESS]

## VA Health Connect Discovery

Discovery for issue [#27688](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/27688). New options for contacting the VA are becoming available and need to be added to the VAMC pages. Before we can determine the right experience for Veterans, we need to understand both the individual options and the landscape.

- Clinical contact center
- 24 hours live by phone
- Regional phone numbers (mapped to health system)
- slow roll-out, will be available nationwide
- How does VA Health Connect differ from "teleurgent care line" which appears on Pittsburgh's operating status page? (see below)

#### Other methods of communication available to Veterans : 

- [VA Secure Messaging](https://www.va.gov/health-care/secure-messaging/)
- [Secure Messaging FAQ](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/secure-messaging-general-faqs)
- Health chat
- in-person conversation


### Goals

Get clarity on when to use this method (from VA perspective) so that we can determine the best method for researching Veteran expectations about their communication options and begin considering the best way to present the information that Veterans need.


### Methodology

Informational interview with secure messaging SME(s) over Microsoft Team.
