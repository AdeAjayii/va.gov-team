## Communication Audit - Research Findings

Follow-up discovery for issue [##27686](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/27686). New options for contacting the VA are becoming available and need to be added to the VAMC pages. Before we can determine the right experience for Veterans, we need to understand both the individual options and the landscape.

### Goals

Get clarity on when to use which method (from VA perspective) so that we can determine the best method for researching Veteran expectations about their communication options and begin considering the best way to present the information that Veterans need.


- **Where does this product fit into the Veteran journey?** ([Patient Experience journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Patient%20Experience%20Journey%20Map.pdf) || [Veteran journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf))
    - Patient experience: before or after a visit; at any point a patient needs to communicate with the VA regarding their health care needs
    - Veteran journey: Starting up or getting out (Veterans looking for health care for the first time) or at any point after a Veteran has already registered for health care

### Questions
- **What is a typical use case for this product?**
    - Scheduling appointments
    - Questions about medications
    - Requesting prescription refills
    - Providing updates on health condition
    - Non-urgent general health care questions
    - Non-urgent general questions about health benefits

### Methodology

UX Audit of Veteran facing contact methods - health care focus

### Key Findings
 
1. Multiple contact method labels, who's names don't clearly indicate their purpose, co-exist within the VA.gov ecosystem. Some seem duplicative to each other and others are overly branded, which may obfuscate the service that it offers. In adition, some of these labels may not be relevant or available in all locations. In these instances, some health systems list the same number under multiple labels. For example, Bay Pines uses 888-820-0230 under the following labels: 24-hour nurse, Primary care call center, Telephone care, Make an appointment, Change your appointment, Pharmacy refill, Automated refill line. 
    - Main phone
    - MyVA411 main information line
    - "Call us"
    - 24-hour nurse
    - Telephone care 
    - Telephone assistance service (how VA benefits hotline is described when calling)
    - VA benefits hotline
    - health benefits hotline
    - Health care benefits
    - VA Health Connect
    - Clinical Contact Center
    - Primary care call center
    - My HealtheVet help desk

2. Contact methods are distributed among many different sections and pages globally and within health systems. This places all the burden on Veterans to either understand the VA's organizational system or browse multiple pages to then locate and compare communication options. There's no way to easily see all the phone options to compare them nor does the site offer a way to search or filter among them. This makes poorly labeled contact methods even more problematic as it places undue burden on a person's working memory to do all comparison by memory. In addition, the current distrubution of information may confuse users as to what is a national vs a location/system specific phone number. Some examples of places where numbers, though not exhaustive:
    - Global: Contact us
    - Global: Helpful VA phone numbers
    - System: Contact us 
    - System: Contact us / Pharmacy
    - System: Make an appt
    - System: Register for care
    - System: Operating status / Patient resources


3. When and how a "toll free" number gets listed is inconsistent across VAMC pages
    - Sometimes both numbers are offered under a single label, "352-374-6105 or 800-349-9457"  
    - Sometimes options are sub-labeled, "Toll free: #, Local: #"
    - Sometimes options are sub-labeled, "Direct:"
    - Sometimes options are not sub-labeled

Questions:
1. Do we have a clear understanding of the part of the Veteran journeys that we want to prioritize? A Veteran who is Starting out/Getting out and wanting to engage in healthcare for the first time may need to be prioritized for work on VA.gov vs a Veteran who is already using MyHealtheVet. Are their behaviors different? 
2. What Veteran top tasks should we prioritize? e.g. enroll, refill a Rx, make an appt, talk to a nurse, etc 
3. How does label naming match the task a Veteran is trying to accomplish? "Make an appointment" more likely matches a Veteran's mental model when trying to complete a task than does "Telephone care".
4. Which contact methods do Veterans use most today? Why?
5. Which contact methods does VA want to prioritize for top tasks? At what point of care?
6. Are Veteran and VA priorities aligned? 


Recommendations:
1. Stakeholders need to be aligned to help prioritize which methods

### Additional questions

- In previous studies, multiple Veterans mention the "Nurse Line". Why do they call this number over other numbers?
- Veterans who are already engaged in health care may already be comfortable using their "main" number, this confusion is likely to cause the most confusion with Veterans who are just starting to engage in healthcare.
