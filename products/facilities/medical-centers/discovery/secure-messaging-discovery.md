[IN PROGRESS]

## Secure Messaging Discovery

Discovery for issue [#27687](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/27687). New options for contacting the VA are becoming available and need to be added to the VAMC pages. Before we can determine the right experience for Veterans, we need to understand both the individual options and the landscape.

### Goals

Get clarity on when to use this method (from VA perspective) so that we can determine the best method for researching Veteran expectations about their communication options and begin considering the best way to present the information that Veterans need.

### Methodology

Informational interview with secure messaging SME(s).

### Key Findings

- **Where does this product fit into the Veteran journey?** ([Patient Experience journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Patient%20Experience%20Journey%20Map.pdf) || [Veteran journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf))
    - Patient experience: before or after a visit; at any point a patient needs to communicate with their health care team, when not in-person
    - Veteran journey: from the point a Veteran is registered for VA health care, secure messaging could apply anytime a Veteran needs to communicate with their health care team
- **What is a typical use case for this product?**
    - Sheduling appointments
    - Requesting prescription refills
    - Non-urgent general health care questions
- **Why would a Veteran use this, as opposed to something like [Health Chat](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/27686)?**
    - Benficial to have a record of previous communications (see [Digital Modernization research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/discovery/Digital%20Helath%20Modernization%20-%20Research.pdf))
    - Works on Veteran's own schedules; relieves pressure of real-time communicaiton via chat or phone
- **What does a Veteran need to know about this?**
    - Secure messaging cannot be used for emergency or urgent communication
    - Health care teams are different, and Veterans and their team must agree on if, and how, they want to use secure messaging
    - Veterans can only communicate with health care teams they are authorized to communicate with

## SME Interview(s)

### Additional questions

- Does messaging connect directly to a specifc health care team, or at the system level first?
- How do Veterans currently learn about secure messaging? (ie. Are health care teams supposed to inform them?)
- Can Veterans ask general non health care questions? (ie. Questions about their education benefits?)

**SME:** Jen Echer, UX Designer, Ad Hoc (research and design for secure messaging mobile app)

- Secure messaging is a trusted and preferred method of communication, preferred over phone calls, and second only to in-person conversation.
- Depending on the health care team, secure messaging can be used for a variety of purposes including: filling prescriptions, appointments, and even scheduling rides. Messages are triaged by a Veteran's health care team, and it depends on what the team is open to using messaging for.
- Developing a relationship with the health care team was important for Veterans, in establishing communication norms. Degree of responsiveness varied depending on the team, but officially it's supposed to be within 3 business days.
- On the health care team side, there is training and onboarding they must go through before using secure messaging.
- Secure messaging isn't for introductory purposes: a Veteran must already be registered and in contact with their health care team, and they can only communicate with health care providers they are authorized for - no contacting different people in different health systems [like for more information or second opinions].
- Health care providers may be somewhat distrustful of more apps to use, including secure messaging, if they already have established methods.

- [Patricia]
    - It used to be that you had to opt into secure messaging, but now when you have access to My HealtheVet, you automatically have access to secure messaging, under one set of terms and conditions
- [Tracey]
    - There is no general mailbox that then distributes messages to other teams. The patient gets associate to teams based on their relationship - it's based on their primary care enrollment, clinics they've been seen in or will be seen in, it's based on specialty lists that have been created in Vista, in the patient care part of the application, and there's manual association. A patient cannot message any team that they have not already had an established relationship with. At some facilities the patient may have 15 - 20 teams, and then there are some facilities where they might only have 3 - 4. It depends on how the facility themselves have set up general groups. 
    - We might have an "ask the director" team at one facility, so then all patients are associated with that "ask the director" [messaging group]. You could have an "ask a pharmacist", "ask a My HealtheVet coordinator", etc. In our VISN we call them "bonus teams" - any patient can see these teams. In some facilities it's more specific, they have very few admin teams, so Vets are only going to the find the teams they are getting care from. 
    - Veterans learn [about secure messaging] sometimes by default - it depends on how they become a premium account holder. If they go through the online upgrade path, they likely are not educated on secure messaging. If they are upgraded in person on on video, if time allows, whoever is doing the education and authentication of the Veteran can take them on a quick tour of the features, including secure messaging. If time allows, My HealtheVet coordinators [in person/video] have Vets send a test message, and check whether a Vet's teams are [all present in the system]. If teams are missing, coordinators can manually add a Vet to those teams. There is a welcome message the welcomes them to secure messaging when they become a premium account holder.
- [Patricia]
    - In the past we had three levels of users: basic, advanced, and premium. Anybody can be a basic user - you have a home page and contacts, but no access to PHI (protected health information). Then they would be matched to MPI (master patient index) and then automatially go to advanced status, and then would go through an in person authentication, or remote authentication, and then they would become premium. Premium allows for use of all the features of My HealtheVet.
    - We recently started a campaign to do away with the "advanced" imbetween status, so we're going to have basic users, or premium users. The authentication requires proof of identity - in person via identity verification and answering some questions, or they can do it online. My HealtheVet coordinators upgrade them after authentication.
    - [Via email after interview] About 67% of My HealtheVet users are premium users.
