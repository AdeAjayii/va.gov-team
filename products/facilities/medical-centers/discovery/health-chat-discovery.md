[IN PROGRESS]

## VA Health Chat Discovery

Discovery for issue [#27686](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/27686). New options for contacting the VA are becoming available and need to be added to the VAMC pages. Before we can determine the right experience for Veterans, we need to understand both the individual options and the landscape.

### Goals

Get clarity on when to use this method (from VA perspective) so that we can determine the best method for researching Veteran expectations about their communication options and begin considering the best way to present the information that Veterans need.

### Methodology

Informational interview with health chat SME(s).

### Key Findings

- **Where does this product fit into the Veteran journey?** ([Patient Experience journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Patient%20Experience%20Journey%20Map.pdf) || [Veteran journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf))
    - Patient experience:
    - Veteran journey:
- **What is a typical use case for this product?**
- **Why would a Veteran use this, as opposed to something like [secure messaging](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/27687)?**
    - Health chat is for questions that require real-time responses, for minor health issues and requests (not for emergencies). Example issues include:
        - You feel ill and unsure about going to an emergency room or clinic
        - You have a reaction to a medication
        - You have questions about your prescriptions
        - You need medical advice for a minor injury or illness, such as:
            - Allergies
            - Congestion/cough/cold
            - Ear ache
            - Fever
            - Rash
            - Sore throat
            - Stomachache
- **What does a Veteran need to know about this?**
