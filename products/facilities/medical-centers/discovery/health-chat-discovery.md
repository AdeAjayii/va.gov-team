[SME INTERVIEW PENDING]

## VA Health Chat - Research Findings

Discovery for issue [#27686](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/27686). New options for contacting the VA are becoming available and need to be added to the VAMC pages. Before we can determine the right experience for Veterans, we need to understand both the individual options and the landscape.

### Goals

Get clarity on when to use this method (from VA perspective) so that we can determine the best method for researching Veteran expectations about their communication options and begin considering the best way to present the information that Veterans need.

### Key Findings

- **Where does this product fit into the Veteran journey?** ([Patient Experience journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Patient%20Experience%20Journey%20Map.pdf) || [Veteran journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf))
    - Patient experience: VA health chat applies to before and after a visit to a VA facility or meeting with a health care representative
    - Veteran journey: from the point a Veteran is registered for VA health care, health chat could apply anytime a Veteran needs to communicate with representatives from their health care system
- **What is a typical use case for this product?**
    - You feel ill and unsure about going to an emergency room or clinic
    - You have a reaction to a medication
    - You have questions about your prescriptions
    - Minor health issues such as: allergies, cough/cold, fever, ear ache, sore throat, etc.
    - Requests such as: finding facilities, scheduling appointments, refilling prescriptions, and sending non-urgent messages to health care teams
- **Why would a Veteran use this, as opposed to something like [secure messaging](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/27687)?**
    - Health chat is for questions that require real-time responses, such as for minor health issues requiring immediate feedback
- **What does a Veteran need to know about this?**
    - Veterans must be upgraded premium members, via My HealtheVet members or a sign-in partner equivalent, to use health chat (see [upgrading your My HealtheVet account](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/upgrade-account-to-premium#UpgradeToPremiumAccount))
    - VA health chat is not for emergency situations
    - Only available in select states, and in select health care systems
    - Health care teams are different, and Veterans and their team must agree on if, and how, they want to use VA health chat

### Additional questions

- Does health chat connect directly to a specifc health care team, or at the system level first?
- How do Veterans currently learn about health chat? (ie. Are health care teams supposed to inform them?)
- Does health chat keep a record of past conversations anywhere?
- Can Veterans ask general non health care questions? (ie. Questions about their education benefits?)
