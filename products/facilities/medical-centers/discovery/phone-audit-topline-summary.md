## Phone Audit for Communication Discovery

Follow-up discovery for issue [##27686](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/27686). New options for contacting the VA are becoming available and need to be added to the VAMC pages. Before we can determine the right experience for Veterans, we need to understand both the individual options and the landscape.

### Goals

Get clarity on when to use this method, by phone, (from VA perspective) so that we can determine the best method for researching Veteran expectations about their communication options and begin considering the best way to present the information that Veterans need.


- **Where does this product fit into the Veteran journey?** ([Patient Experience journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Patient%20Experience%20Journey%20Map.pdf) || [Veteran journey map](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf))
    - Patient experience: before or after a visit; at any point a patient needs to communicate with the VA regarding their health care needs
    - Veteran journey: Starting up or getting out or at any point after a Veteran has already registered for health care

### Questions
- **What is a typical use case for this product?**
    - Sheduling appointments
    - Questions about medications
    - Requesting prescription refills
    - Providing updates on health condition
    - Non-urgent general health care questions
    - Non-urgent general questions about health benefits

### Methodology

UX Audit of Veteran facing phone numbers - health care focus

### Key Findings
 
- Multiple phone labels co-exist within the VA.gov ecosystem that have similar sounding names, without clear purpose, and therefor not easy to differentiate.
    - 24-hour nurse
    - Primary care call center
    - Telephone care 
    - VA benefits hotline
    - VA health benefits hotline
    - My HealtheVet help desk
    - Health care benefits

- Phone numbers are inconsistently labeled across VA.gov, VAMC pages and even within a health system
  - Some examples:  
    - Bay Pines uses 888-820-0230 under the following labels: 24-hour nurse, Primary care call center, Telephone care, Make an appointment, Change your appointment, Pharmacy refill, Automated refill line 

- When and how a "toll free" number gets listed is inconsistent across VA.gov
    - Sometimes both numbers are offered, "Call 352-374-6105 or 800-349-9457"  
    - Sometimes options are labeled, "Toll free: #, Local: #"



### Additional questions

- In previous studies, multiple Veterans mention the "Nurse Line". Why do they call this number over other numbers?
- Veterans who are already engaged in health care may already be comfortable using their "main" number, this confusion is likely to cause the most confusion with Veterans who are just starting to engage in healthcare.
