## Phone Audit for Communication Discovery

Follow-up discovery for issue [##27686](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/27686). New options for contacting the VA are becoming available and need to be added to the VAMC pages. Before we can determine the right experience for Veterans, we need to understand both the individual options and the landscape.

### Goals

Get clarity on when to use this method (from VA perspective) so that we can determine the best method for researching Veteran expectations about their communication options and begin considering the best way to present the information that Veterans need.

    - Requesting prescription refills
    - Providing updates on health condition
    - Non-urgent general health care questions
    - Non-urgent general questions about health benefits

### Methodology

UX Audit of Veteran facing phone numbers - health care focus

### Key Findings

- Phone numbers are inconsistently labeled across VA.gov and VAMC pages
  - It may be difficult for Veterans to differentiate between the various phone numbers listed on VA.gov pages to decide which number would be best to call. 
- Multipe phone number labels seem to suggest the same service 
- There may be too many phone numbers for Veterans to easily make a decision of which to call


### Additional questions

- In previous studies, multiple Veterans mention the "Nurse Line". Why do they call this number over other numbers?
- Veterans who are already engaged in health care may already be comfortable using their "main" number, this confusion is likely to cause the most confusion with Veterans who are just starting to engage in healthcare.
