## Phone Audit for Communication Discovery

Follow-up discovery for issue [##27686](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/27686). New options for contacting the VA are becoming available and need to be added to the VAMC pages. Before we can determine the right experience for Veterans, we need to understand both the individual options and the landscape.

### Goals

Get clarity on when to use this method, by phone, (from VA perspective) so that we can determine the best method for researching Veteran expectations about their communication options and begin considering the best way to present the information that Veterans need.

    - Patient experience: before or after a visit; at any point a patient needs to communicate with the VA regarding their health care needs
    - Veteran journey: Starting up or getting out or at any point after a Veteran has already registered for health care

### Methodology

UX Audit of Veteran facing phone numbers - health care focus

### Key Findings
 
- Multiple phone labels co-exist within the VA.gov ecosystem that have similar sounding names, some without a clear purpose. Research is needed to understand if Veterans can differentiate them. In adition, some of these labels may not be relevant in all locations. 
    - Main phone
    - 24-hour nurse
    - Primary care call center
    - Telephone care 
    - VA benefits hotline
    - VA health benefits hotline
    - My HealtheVet help desk
    - Health care benefits
    - Telephone assistance service (how VA benefits hotline is described when calling)


- Phone numbers within health systems are distributed among many different sections and subpages forcing a user to browse and click around to understand the VA's organizational system to then locate a phone number rather than see a contralized listing of numbers first with an option to click for more. There's no way to easily see all the phone options to compare them nor does the site offer a way to search or filter among them. This information architecture may confuse users as to what is a national vs a location/system specific phone number and in worse cases tax users with cognitive disabilities. Some examples of places where numbers, though not exhaustive:
    - Global: Contact us
    - Global: Helpful VA phone numbers
    - System: Contact us 
    - System: Contact us / Pharmacy
    - System: Make an appt
    - System: Register for care


- Phone numbers are inconsistently labeled across VA.gov, VAMC pages and even within a health system
  - For example:  
    - Bay Pines uses 888-820-0230 under the following labels: 24-hour nurse, Primary care call center, Telephone care, Make an appointment, Change your appointment, Pharmacy refill, Automated refill line 

- When and how a "toll free" number gets listed is inconsistent across VAMC pages
    - Sometimes both numbers are offered under a single label, "352-374-6105 or 800-349-9457"  
    - Sometimes options are sub-labeled, "Toll free: #, Local: #"
    - Sometimes options are sub-labeled, "Direct:"
    - Sometimes options are not sub-labeled

Recommendations:
- Revise naming of vague labels to be more obvious, e.g. Telephone care. 
- Health System Contact us page:
    - Consider making it easier for the Veteran to easily scan top phone numbers by surfacing them on this page like the national contact us page does with a table

### Additional questions

- In previous studies, multiple Veterans mention the "Nurse Line". Why do they call this number over other numbers?
- Veterans who are already engaged in health care may already be comfortable using their "main" number, this confusion is likely to cause the most confusion with Veterans who are just starting to engage in healthcare.
