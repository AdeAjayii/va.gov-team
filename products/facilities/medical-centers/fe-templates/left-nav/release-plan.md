# Release Plan: VAMC Left Navigation update  (WIP)

## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)
The left navigation component was initially designed as a part of the redesign of VAMC website which was soft launched in September 2019, beginning with the Pittsburgh health care system. 

A usability study was conducted in November/December 2019 to evaluate how the user experience of VA.gov could be improved with a redesign of the existing left navigation component. The [existing site](https://www.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care) was tested to establish a baseline of behaviors and a live protype of the new design was testing in the [staging environment](https://staging.va.gov/pittsburgh-health-care). 

### Results:
- [Research report](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/left-nav/research-findings.md#local-nav-research-report)
- Number of users: 5 Veterans with Pittsburgh VAMC experience were recruited to ensure familiarity with the content. 
- Bugs identified 
  - Breadcrumbs displayed inconsistently throughout the staging site, with the “Home” breadcrumb appearing and disappearing.
  - Accessibility defects within the staging prototype were identified and are documented in [#3411](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/3411)
- Recommendations for UX changes based on user feedback included:
   - Creation of a more discernible difference between levels in the hierarchy. 
   - Closer integration of breadcrumbs with the page title 
   - Keep opened accordions open and display all third level pages in the local navigation, except when they are chronologically listed 
  

## Go Live!

These changes will be available to 100% of the Veterans and Veteran Caregivers accessing the Pittsburgh health care system website.  Between March 29 and April 29, there were 24,784 pageviews for pittsburgh-health-care pages. 

### Planning:
- Desired date: 05/08/2020
- Post-launch KPI 1: By April 30, Veterans can access Pittsburgh VAMC top task content from Left Navigation menu within 4 clicks or less. 
- Post-launch KPI 2: By June 30, Veterans can access Pittsburgh VAMC’s most frequently viewed content using the Left Nav menu. 
  - This to ensure that the Pittsburgh VAMC Left Navigation menu supports efficient navigation to the pages Veterans view as most meaningful/relevant.
