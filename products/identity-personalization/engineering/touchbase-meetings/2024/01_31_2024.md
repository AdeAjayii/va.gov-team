# Engineering meeting 01/31/2024

## Agenda

- Mock server
  - CJS vs ESM, and how to mitigate
  - [Ticket around this work and current status ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/74968)
  - Concerns
    - Making changes to platform level code and what implications / cross app breaking changes could occur
    - Maintaining autocompletion and DX for engineering
    - Mocker-api is old, not great for building a mock api and could be replaced by better solutions
      - MSW, straight Express or Fastify implementations to allow ESM instead of CJS
      - Ideally, using a response in an e2e test should be easier / cross compatible with our local mock api setup
      - MSW has actually been used in unit tests    
- USWDS V3 migration
  -  Adam will be doing a push to migrate the rest (6 pages!) to USWDS by the end of next sprint when the deadline is.
  -  Alert has some bottom margin issues, and modals aren't great, but usable and issues have been submitted around large variant and button stacking
