## Agenda

- Welcome Daniel!
- Downtime approaching
  - DowntimeNotification component and dependencies for services
  - Feature Toggle for individual pages / fine grained control
    - Per page or global + config?
    - Could really use a sub toggle that could be managed in conjunction with primary toggle
      - admin user/dev defined array of strings to add and remove from this subtoggle

## Cool dev stuff
