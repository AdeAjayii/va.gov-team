# Notes around engineering on the Authenticated Experience
 
### New Notification Center App!
- Any percieved challenges in building the MVP
  - Pagination, dismissing alerts vs showing all with dismissed status, general design concerns?
  - Location of app folder - thoughts on why root vs inside personalization folder
- App structure, organizational ideas or patterns that we would like to explore
  - redux store patterns
  - component structures
  - exploring custom hooks
  - making the mock server more easily set up or routes more easily configured to go along with cypress intercepts
  - a great time to look into other app patterns that might make this 
   
### Yarn workspaces in vets-website
  - Adam had mentioned how imoprts can be either `~/` based as a workaround or the yarn workspace package name can be used, and is the official way that platform wants us to import packages from the `platform` folder
  - [PR that mentions the imports](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/24664#discussion_r1253731771)
  - Eslint warnings will usually show some hints to help resolve the package import
    ```
    Importing from platform via platform/startup is deprecated.
    Import from @department-of-veterans-affairs/platform-startup
    instead or check babel.config.json for an alias to the import.
    ```
  - The main problem can be making sure that the way you are importing from the workspace package is correct.
