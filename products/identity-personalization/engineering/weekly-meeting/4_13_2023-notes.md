- Moving meeting to Thursdays, so that we can concentrate on finishing tickets especially on the Tues before the sprint end.
- What would we like to get out of these meetings?
  - Share interesting resources
  - Discuss anything challenging in current work
  - Ask for feedback around PRs or WIP branches
  - ???

- Weekly cadence may not be the most efficient or really needed at this point.
  - Move to async meeting for majority of meetings, and meet in person when discussion is warranted?
  - We have our slack convo that is just the 4 of us where we can immediately ask engineering questions when they arrise.
