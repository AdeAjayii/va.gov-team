# Engineering Meeting - Authenticated Experience

### Design System Component Library
 - web components built with [stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)
 - repo https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/component-library
 - Super easy to use and well documented
   - https://design.va.gov/components
 - React specific issues with web-components/stencil
    - Events can be tricky to hook up
    - Rendering children and interop with react can cause errors
    - navigation behavior challenges on thing like links - SPA vs MPA and react router
    - styling limitations and scoped styling is inflexible
 - Testing is hard for web components
    - unit testing the internals of the components when they are used is not really possible right now in vets-website
       - https://github.com/testing-library/dom-testing-library/issues/413 
    - e2e cypress testing requires [.shadow()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/shadow) to be used first
    - rendering lag / race conditions has been encountered when testing, and requires some jank fixes
