# Engineering Meeting - Authenticated Experience

### Design System Component Library
 - web components built with [stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)
 - repo https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/component-library
 - Super easy to use and well documented
   - https://design.va.gov/components
 - React specific issues with web-components/stencil
  - Events can be tricky to hook up
  - Rendering children and interop with react can cause errors
  - navigation behavior challenges on thing like links - SPA vs MPA and react router
  - styling limitations and scoped styling is inflexible
