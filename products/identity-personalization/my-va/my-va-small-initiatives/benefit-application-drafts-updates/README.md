## Overview

The team has consistently received feedback that the "what benefits does VA offer" menu within the Benefit Application Drafts section on My VA is problematic in that it doesn't really make sense and can be confusing to sighted and screenreader users alike. Rather than create another section on My VA, and based on an evaluation of analytics, the team is going to proceed with an experiment to temporarily hide the sub-header with expandable menu and contents. The team will evaulate how this impacts search metrics for those benefit pages, and ultimately (assuming the team sees no negative impact) remove the the content permanently from the page.

This will be a change to both the LOA1 and LOA3 states on My VA.

## Measuring Success

### Objective: Provide greater consistency and simplification of the Benefit Application Drafts section.

**Key Result: We will not see searches for the benefits in the "what benefits does VA offer" menu move into the top 50 search terms.**
- There are already some search terms (eg. careers) that are in the top 50. Given their already high rankings, we probably won't learn much even if they do move up a little bit as a result of this menu going away.
- We will monitor for a month to start. If there isn't a signifant change in metrics, we can permanently remove the menu. If we do see metrics moving in a way that concerns us, we'll monitor for a second month.
