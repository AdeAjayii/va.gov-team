# My VA analytics review 

Notes from 3.22.22

## Reports referenced

All reports are from 7.1.22 (around when the 2.0 design launched) to 3.21.22

- [My VA analytics dashboard](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/dashboard/XOEdSZeVT9qyxQU5T29PNw/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20210701&_u.date01=20220321/)
- [My VA interactions](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20210701&_u.date01=20220321&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowStart=0&explorer-table.rowCount=25&_r.drilldown=analytics.pagePath:www.va.gov~2Fmy-va~2F,analytics.eventCategory:Interactions/) (**Note**: These numbers slightly differ from the aggregate data on the analytics dashboard because they are for /my-va/ only and don't include all URLs that include /my-va/)
- [Searches initiated from My VA](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-site-search-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20210701&_u.date01=20220321&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=50&_r.drilldown=analytics.searchStartPage:www.va.gov~2Fmy-va~2F/)

## Notes

- "View your profile" is the top click.
- Claim info, as expected, is also a primary action. I think we've placed it on the page accordingly.
- Surprisingly high rankings for clicking in "What benefits does the VA offer" and the education benefit application. Both rank higher than all health care links (which is both surprising and unsurprising given that most health care users go straight to MHV).
- Besides going to MHV via the main nav (#10), clicking into messages is the top-ranked health care task (#12).

## Questions

- Why is "View your profile" the top click? Do people expect to see info on My VA that they do not? Or do people need to make profile updates?
- If we moved up "You have n unread messages," would more people get to their health care inboxes faster?

## Thoughts

- We will likely see a huge jump in actions after we point users logging in from the homepage to My VA. It may be worth waiting to get analytics from that to determine next steps for anything.
