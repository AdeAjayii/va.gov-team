# Proposal for My VA --> logged-in homepage transition

## Plan overview

This is the high level proposal for a plan to transition the My VA dashboard to become the logged-in homepage:

- Start transition after the payments & debts module on My VA launches (target: late March/early April 2022).
- For people who login from the homepage, redirect them to My VA instead of keeping them on the homepage. Launch this to 25% of users for ~1 month, then evaluate analytics.
- Determine next steps/tweeks. If necessary, make updates and changes to My VA before next phase of launch.
- Launch to 50% of users for ~1 month, then evaluate analytics.
- Determine next steps/tweeks. If necessary, make updates and changes to My VA before next phase of launch.
- Launch to 100% of users for ~1 month, then evaluate analytics.

2. If a link lives on te homepage and does *not* live on My VA (eg. link to get your DD214), clicks into those pages will decrease.

### Increased searches

For information that does not exist on My VA that does exist on the homepage, are we seeing more searches for these terms?
