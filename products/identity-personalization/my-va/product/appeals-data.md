# Appeals data

So we have a sense of scale for the appeals process, there are:

- 180,000 Appeals Pending at the VA
- 85,000 Hearings Pending at the VA
- About 2000 Hearings Per Month, though the VA wants to significantly increase this.

~**However**, there is no way to currently view an appeals hearing date/time online. [Per Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C3AT1CRGC/p1636580217127300?thread_ts=1636579971.126600&cid=C3AT1CRGC):~

~> Oh, no a Veteran cannot check to find when his or her hearing is scheduled for online.  That's sent via mail, and for some types of hearings via email as well. Their representatives can see it if they have Caseflow access.~

**Update**: It might actually be possible to view BVA hearing appointments on VA.gov, [Per Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C3AT1CRGC/p1636754862140000?thread_ts=1636579971.126600&cid=C3AT1CRGC):

> @paul and @Samara (She/Her). Sorry to be late to this conversation! If I’m understanding the question correctly, I think a Veteran CAN see information about an upcoming hearing on VA.gov. It’s  on the Check Your Claims and Appeals page. Here’s a screenshot from Staging, with an upcoming hearing listed. (URL: https://staging.va.gov/track-claims/appeals/2221530/status)
