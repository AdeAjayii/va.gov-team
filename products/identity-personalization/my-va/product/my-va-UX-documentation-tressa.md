We didn't end up using all of these for some technical restrictions, but it gives you an idea of thought process.

### Future additions to My VA

- [Education section](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/education/discovery-and-research) - this was put off because no one knows where data points are being pulled from. We cannot implement this section until the DGIB team has a clear understanding of what currently does/does not exist in their API.
- Dependent information
- Different user roles dashboards (e.g. caregiver, dependents)
- 


### Things you should know

- Users have repeatedly said they only want to see things that are actionable or a problem on their dashboard.
- Users have repeatedly said that they would like to see My VA first-thing after they log in.
- People appreciate redundancy when it comes to important or time-sensitive information.
- Users have mentioned wanting to be able to 'customize' their dashboard - this is not something that is technically feasible right now.

### Things you should know

- Users really want to see their drs. name or specific facility in relation to their upcoming appointment. Currently this doesn't exist in VAOS, but hopefully eventually will.
