- 'View lab results' and 'View medical records' behave differently - one opens in another tab, another opens in the same tab 
  - Ticket/PR: https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/pull/17670 
- We discovered that there is an additional very old my va page that is still live. We passed this information on to the appropriate parties. 
- The claims/appeals APIs are *very* slow - Erik is working on a potential solution to this.
- We should also hide the education benefit block if a user has started an edu benefit application.
