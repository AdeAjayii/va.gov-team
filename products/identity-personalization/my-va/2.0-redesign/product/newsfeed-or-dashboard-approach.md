# Notes from DEPO chats about My VA: Do we take a newsfeed or dashboard approach?

## 12.2.20 3:00 ET chat with Meg, Danielle, Ryan, and Steve

- Meg - Tell veteran what they need to know now or what they need to know soon.
- Steve giving some history — dashboard was supposed to be the “action” center. Profile is everything the VA knows about you. Steve thinks that this is way too broadly scoped.
- Don’t just contextualize how this shows up in VA.gov, but how it fills into competitive landscape — what is your expectation when you log in to your bank or health care website?
- Meg is thinking about hierarchy — a “pure” newsfeed wouldn’t be hierarchical. We have a limited set of things now, but is there a way to figure out how to show blank state?
- Ryan - “I love the task oriented approach organized by priority”. If you’re a new veteran, you don’t have a lot, but here are somethings you *could* do. If you’ve been here for 5 years, and there’s nothing for you to do, that’s OK. To him, the hierarchy is the same across scenarios, but based on what you have, we know what to surface first. Eg. Calorie counting app — you alway start with nothing. Then you go into the meet of it. Apple health - very different for everyone; some people are active and some are not, but there are some baseline things. Where it gets dicey — what happens when you have multiple things within a thing (like health care and appointments)?
- Steve - There is the bank affordance of “here is your account and the transaction on your account.” Then there’s the level up “here’s your account and here is your summary.” Sometimes he thinks that the dashboard is the level up in the bank metaphor, where it’s “here is the first couple of things you need to know about your account with compensation.” “Here’s your first could of things that you need to know about your health care.” And maybe it’s nothing. Mentioned benefit eligibility — the one thing the dashboard was initial attempt to fix was actually benefit eligibility, so it kind of needs to be here’s the stuff you have and here’s the stuff you could get.

### Which approach?

- Meg: Traditional dashboard — Steve said something that really resonated with me about what’ is available to them. It’s also a more stable and steady approach. There are also possibilities for scaling it. I think a newsfeed might be too volatile and might not grab your attention.
- Danielle: Feels the same way as Meg. For edu, someone might have some of that going as transitioning. I could be totally off base on this, but it feels like if you had a bunch of notifications, it could be overwhelming from a cognitive perspective.
- Ryan: Dashboard
- Steve: Dashboard
