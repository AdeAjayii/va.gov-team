# Research Plan for VSA Authenticated Experience: MyVA Redesign February 2021

## Goals

The goal of this research is to understand user comprehension of the MyVA page after a full re-structure and re-design. This includes:
 
- Overall, is there enough relevant information on the dashboard to be valuable?
- Can the user find the tools and tasks that they are looking for effectively? 
- Can the user easily access and understand any personal updates (related to claims, health care, or forms)?
- Is the new dashboard layout more effective than the current MyVA page?

## Background

Based on past user interviews, we know people come to VA.gov to see information that is relevant to them and to complete tasks specific to their benefits. Users do not want to see links, suggestions or information that doesn't apply to them personally on their dashboard.

Our goal is to create a My VA dashboard design that will improve the online experience for Veterans, by better integrating Veteran-provided data onto the My VA dashboard. The MyVA dashboard aims to surface the status and the most recent update to a users health care information, claims information, and any applications in progress. Users should also be able to quickly and easily reach the tools that allow them to manage this information.

## Research questions

- Can users easily complete tasks easily on the dashboard?
- Can users easily understand updates to their information? 
- Do users understand how to navigate to the tools to manage their information?
- Is the information provided on the dashboard valuable to the user?
- How do people think the new dashboard compares to the current MyVA?



- Can users navigate to MyVA easily from an unauthenticated screen?
- Can Veterans find what they're looking for as a first time user?
- Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?
- Can people find what they're looking for on the dashboard?
- Can users easily understand updates to their information? 
- Can users complete tasks easily on the dashboard?
- Does the placement and wording of the disability rating make sense to users?
- Do users understand how to view their disability rating breakdown?
- Do users understand how to navigate to the tools to manage their information?
- In the claims and health care sections, do users understand what is being displayed? Is it enough information?
- In the claims and health care sections, does the hierarchy of the information make sense?
- If there are no updates to show, does a user understand why?
- If a user has no updates, can they still navigate to the tool to manage their information?
- Do users understand how to get to the tools to manage their information?
- Do users understand how to view and access applications in progress?
- Do users understand how to apply for benefits they are not currently recieving?
- Are the additional links provided on the dashboard useful?
- Is the information provided on the dashboard valuable to the user?
- Is any information missing on the dashboard?
- How do people think the new dashboard compares to the current MyVA?

## Hypothesis & assumptions

- The new myVA dashboard layout will overall be intuitive and scan-able
- Users will understand how to navigate to tools to manage their information
- Users may want to see some additional information on the dashboard that we did not include
- Participants might be confused about some of the verbiage used (most likely in the prescriptions section)
- Participants might be confused that the links to view all (i.e. You have 2 unread messages) will take them to a separate page/site

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype.

## Participants and Recruitment

Recruit for 12 sessions (8 fulfilled sessions) using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants

* Are you eligible for/recieve VA health care, have active or past claims or recieve any benefits from the VA? (pass = yes)
    * If participants with health care, claims or benefits are too difficult to recruit for, then expand to having logged-in to va.gov within the last year.

### Good to have for participants
* At least one iOS mobile device owner
* At least one Android mobile device owner
* At least 2 women
* At least 1 person of color
* At least 2 participants 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
* At least 1 participant who currently receives VA health care
* At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
* At least one person with an identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI
 

### Recruitment requirements
* All participants must use a mobile device.
* The participants have Zoom downloaded **on their phone** prior to the session
* The participants know how to screen-share.

We will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.

## Timeline
