Conversation Guide for MyVA (2)
Intro - 2 minutes
Start recording.
I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? Yes. 
Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, can you tell me a little about yourself? I am 41, I was in the army for 2 years. I am almost done with school and went to be a medical assistant. I also work for blue cross blue shield for processing claims. 
If stuck: What branch did you serve in? Army.
What type of phone do you use? How do you typically use your phone versus your desktop if you have one? Laptop. 
Difference: I use it for games, social media and to use google. 
Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA? Yes
How often do you go online to manage your benefits? Maybe twice a month. 
What do you typically do to manage your benefits online? Basically going in there if I need to add infomration for my dependent and order my meds as well as talking to my provider through secure messaging. 
Do you currently, or have you ever, filed a claim or appeal with the VA? I have filed a claim but not an appeal. 
If user answers no to benefits and claims, ask if they have logged onto va.gov within the last year.
If you were to login to a personalized space on the VA, what are the top actions you'd want to take when managing your benefits: that’s tough. For my since I don’t get normal education benefits. I would like to see the non GI bill benefits, managing healthcare like prescriptions and making an appointment online. 
Anything else: just checking payment schedules to make sure it is correct, that is about it in case I needed to print it out for someone. 
GI bill: I don’t get the GI Bill, I receive VocRehab.  There’s not really anywhere to check on that, you can see how many months but as far as submitting paperwork you can’t do that, you need to do it through email with your VocRehab counselor. 
First Task - Unauthenticated Nav/MyVA - 5 minutes
You've come to VA.gov and you want to see the latest updates on your benefits.
Where would you expect to see the latest updates on your benefits? I assume under disability when you scroll down you can check the claim or appeal status. or if you are looking for payments, you would need to scroll down farther to check on that. 
Go ahead and scroll to the top nav/header, you'll see a link that says 'MyVA'.
Without clicking on it, can you tell me what you would expect to see on this page? I guess maybe your personal infomration, infomration maybe about where your claim history, possibly just infomration that you may need to know for yourself. 
Great, thank you. If you could go ahead and click on MyVA in the top right hand corner.	
What do you mean about information you need to know: if you need to submit paperwork for a claim, like messages asking you to submit xyz or what else you need to do as far as your claim or appeal. 
Just as a reminder - all of the information in this prototype is completely made up. We will be logging in today as 'Kim Washington' (who is completely fictional) today and if you could pretend to be her for these exercises, that would be great.

Where would you go to look for your education benefits: you would need to scroll almost to the bottom and look at education benefits but it only says apply for education benefits. 
What do you see: Claims, list of prescriptions, once you get to the healthcare section it shows you what you have applied for such as healthcare or disability. After that it lets you know the other benefits that could eb available to you. 
Why this one: it is one of the most used by veterans so it is there for you to use. If you want to go back to school you can apply for it and it is there for you to sue to pay for school during the process.
How would you learn more about the benefits: Up under what benefits does the va offer. 
Click on that and look, is there anything missing: no it includes everything that you would need to know they offer. 
Second task: Health care
Messages - 7 min
Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. Imagine you are currently enrolled in health care with the VA. You've come to this page to see how many new messages you have from your health care team.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? It is right above appointments. It has where you have the latest message and fi you have more than one unread message it has the link to the page to read the messages. 
If you saw this information on your dashboard, what would you do next? Click the link to read the unread messages. 
How many new messages do you have? All together it looks like it would be 3. 
Was it easy or hard to find your new messages? Easy. It isn’t far from the top of the page, it is not hard, under healthcare it has messages. It is very easy to see when you scroll down. 
If you were to click on the link '2 unread messages', what would you expect to happen? To my inbox. It is myhealthevet messaging inbox. 
If you were looking to send a message and you were on this page, what would you do? That’s a good questions, click on the 2 unread and if it takes you to the inbox if it takes you there it should have a link to create a new message. 
Where would that be: right when you click unread messages and it takes you to the myhealthevet inbox. 
What is confusing about this section? Nothing.
What information is missing here? There’s no information missing. 
Why do you think we are showing the message in the gray box? How would you read this message? That’s the most recent one received or the last message received. Click on the unread messages link and it takes you to the inbox. 
What is the most important thing we could tell you on this page about your messages? The information you need to know, the last message and how many you have to read. 
Thoughts: No. 
Appointments - 7 min
Okay, we're now going to move on to another scenario. You've come to this page to see when you are visiting your doctor next.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? You would go to appointments and you see the next one, date/time, if it is in person and then the link to see the next 6 appointments. 
If you saw this information on your dashboard, what would you do next? Prepare for the next appointment then go to the link to see the next appointments.,
How many appointments do you have total? 7
If you were to click on the link '6 upcoming appointments', what would you expect to happen? It takes you to the page that tells you the appointment, date/time and if it is in persona or video. It would take me to all appointments. 
If you were looking to schedule an appointment and you were on this page, what would you do?  Actually I don’t see where you can schedule the appointment but it is possible you could message the provider to setup an appointment through messaging. 
What is confusing about this section? Nothing, to is straight to the point,. 
What information is missing here? The contact information for the provider to call and cancel or reschedule if needed. 
Why do you think we are showing the appointment in the gray box? How would you cancel this appointment if you needed to? That’s the most recent upcoming appointment. There isn’t a link to do that so you’d have to call the provider to cancel the appointment. 
What is the most important thing we could tell you on this page about your appointments? Just the date/time and where it is. I would also include a number if they don’t have the number for the provider to call and cancel or reschedule if needed.
Where would it be: at the bottom after the appointment information. 
Prescriptions - 7 min
Okay, now if you could imagine you've come to this page to check whether or not your medication will be arriving soon.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? You would go to healthcare and scroll down until you get to prescription. It ahs the update, what it is , when it was submitted. Also the refills you have. You may be able to click on it and go to the page with the list to see exactly where the prescription is and when it was sent out. 
If you saw this information on your dashboard, what would you do next? Click on the 3 refills to refill the ones I need and also look and see if I can get information for tracking for the ones already refilled. 
Can you describe to me what you are looking at in this prescriptions section?
If you were to click on the link '3 prescription updates', what would you expect to happen? It will take me to the page where I am able to submit the request to refill the prescriptions. 
What does 'prescription update' mean? It is telling me I need the prescriptions. Yes I would need to refill them. 
What is confusing about this section? Nothing. 
What information is missing here? Nothing because like I said it is telling you what you submitted and providing the information that there is 3 available for refill with the link to get them refilled. 
Why do you think we are showing the prescription in the gray box? How would you get more information about this prescription if you needed to? Possibly because it was the last one that was submitted for a refill and it gives you an update on it so a person wont worry about going into it and see when it was submitted and if it was sent out or not. Still click on the refills to see if it would popup and if not I would need to go to the top and click on my health information to check on it that way. 
How many prescriptions do you (aka Kim) have that are currently in the process of being refilled? I have 1 but you have 3 that need to be refilled. 
What is the most important thing we could tell you on this page about your prescriptions? That they need to be refilled and providing updates on the ones already refilled. 
Third Task - Disability rating - 3 min
Okay great, from here you are looking to see what your disability rating is.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? It is at the top. Up under the name it ahs the branch of service and rating. 40% service connected. 
What would you expect to happen if you clicked on the disability rating link? I would think it would take you to the page that shows you the list and percentage for each one. 
Was it easy or hard to find your disability rating? Why? Easy because it is the first thing you see at the top. 
What was confusing about this experience? Nothing was confusing at all. 
Fourth task: Claims scenario - 7 min
Okay, great. Now, I'm going to give you a scenario. You've recently submitted a claim and you are waiting to see if it has been approved. You've just landed on this page.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? Right above healthcare, close to the top. Claims and appeals. It has the status and you can click view details to get the information you need. 
Grey box: most recently submitted and it is providing the status so you don’t need to view detail to see the claim. 
Can you describe to me what you are seeing in this section?
Okay, great. I have another scenario for you. You're looking to see all of your current claims and appeals and you've just landed on this page.
Could you walk me through how you would do that?
If you saw this information on your dashboard, what would you do next? If it is giving me the information I need I wouldn’t click the details but I would click 4 claims pr appeals in progress for details. 
How many claims or appeals do you have? It could be 4 or 5. Possibly 5. 
How to see al: click on the link and it should show you all claims and appeals you have in your history. 
If you were to click on the link '4 claims or appeals in progress' where would you expect that to go?
If you didn't have any claims or appeals in progress, what would you expect to happen? It would be blank or show the last claim you did submit that is completed. 
What do you mean blank: the claims and appeals, not blank but giving you the link to submit a new claim or appeal or just showing the last claim you submitted. 
What is confusing about this section? Nothing to be honest. 
What information is missing in this section? Nothing. 
What is the most important thing we could tell you about your claims and appeals? It is already giving you the infomration you need as far as the stage and them sending you the letter. 
Fifth task: Apply for Benefits - 5 min
Imagine you were interested in applying for some more benefits at the VA.
Could you walk me through how you would do that? If you wanted to do a new application you would click the links that are available. For education you click apply for education benefits, or like a new claim they have to continue the application. 
Where would it go: it would take you to the application you started, it would take you to the beginning to ensure the information is correct. 
Can you describe to me what you are seeing in this section?  
Why do you think the benefits in the 'Benefits you might be interested' section are showing vs some other ones?
If you had started an application, how would you finish and submit it?
What is confusing about this section? As of now Being someone that is good with computers it is not confusing but even with someone without much experience could get through it easily. 
What information is missing in this section? As of right now I don’t see anything that could be missing. 
Thoughts: no not right now. 
How could we improve this section? 
Sixth task: Profile and MyVA - 5 min
Say you've landed on this page and you want to change your mailing address.
Can you walk me through how you would do that? Scroll to the top and click on menu. Nope. This one is pretty difficult to find. I would click on go to profile. I overlooked it. Click on that. 
If you clicked on the link to 'Go to profile', what would you expect to happen? It should bring up the information with your name, mailing address, number and you could update it from there.
How to make it less confusing: I guess with me; I don’t know if you should make it bold. I actually overlooked it. Probably just make it bold so people can see that you can go there to change the information. If you are not paying attention it is easy to overlook. 
Rewrite: I wouldn’t I would just make it bold. 
What is the difference between this page and your profile? With the profile it just has personal information like name, address, email, and number. 
Thoughts: No. 
Seventh task: Overview and Homepage assessment - 7 min
Overview
Go ahead and scroll through this page from the top and walk me through your thoughts on each section, starting with where you see your name (Kimberly) in the blue box.
What are your overall thoughts about this page? The page is simple to get through. I guess if you use it on the phone it would be easier but with me on the computer looking at the phone it is hard to scroll up and down looking at the page. 
What would you use this page for? Just to get information on appointments, claims, prescription refills and education benefits. 
How did these pages meet your expectations? They are simple and easy to go through. If someone were tech savvy it would be easier for the to navigate as well because the section are bolded so they wont miss it. If they need help it would be easy to show them through it. 
How did these pages not meet your expectations? The only thing I overlooked was going to the profile. It is at the top but if you are not paying attention it could be overlooked. 
What would make this page more useful to you? It is useful to me as is. 
Looking to print payment schedule, where would it be: that’s a good question.  It is possible that it could be listed under education as show payment history or disability. It could be under those or on a sperate page. 
Imagine that this was now the first page that you saw directly after logging in.
What would you add, remove, or change about this page if it were your personal homepage? I don’t think I would remove anything. No. 
As first page: I would just add to see the payment history, that’s it. 
Moderators share screen and pull up real homepage Let's look at the existing VA.gov homepage.
Tell me how it compares to the page we just looked at: This page has more information listed as far as the different sections. You can see the payment history for education, change benefits. For healthcare it has the same information as the first one. With records you can get your ID card and change address on the first page. 
What works better: if you are looking on the computer it is easier to navigate but if you are looking on the phone you have to go through more steps to get to changing the address or looking at the payment history and getting an ID card. 
Would you prefer to see the existing homepage when you log in or the My VA page we looked at today as your homepage? Why? It depends on how you are logging into it. If you are logging in on the phone then the first but fi a computer this page. 
Why this one for computer: the desktop I like to see it all at once and as a cell phone I just want to get to what I need to see at that time and if I need more I can get on the laptop. 
If only using the phone, which one do you prefer: The first one. 9 out of 10 I am looking at refills, claim or education benefits. I am just looking for something quick. 
Thoughts: No ma’am.
