## Research Goals 

The goal of this research was to understand user comprehension of the MyVA page after a full re-structure and re-design. This includes:

- Overall, is there enough relevant information on the dashboard to be valuable?
- Can the user find the tools and tasks that they are looking for effectively?
- Can the user easily access and understand any personal updates (related to claims, health care, or forms)?
- Is the new dashboard layout more effective than the current MyVA page?

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to share a high-fidelity prototype. Users were asked to join using their mobile devices (android, iphone and samsung) - but some joined via a laptop or an ipad.

### Who we talked to

- 8 Veterans
- Ages varied from 35-65 (exact demographics unknown)
- All 8 veterans were currently disabled (ranging from 10%-100%)
- 5 out of 8 veterans were currently enrolled and using health care through the VA
- All 8 veterans were currently receiving some type of benefit (retirement, health care, GI bill etc)
- 4 out of 8 veterans had cognitive considerations
- 8 out of 8 veterans managed their benefits online (using primarily MHV and ebenefits)

### Research questions

**Overall questions**
- Did we correctly prioritize this page?
- Is this page useful? Does it have the information and actions it needs?
- Is there anything they expected to see on My VA that’s missing?
- What do people think My VA is?
- What do people think will happen if they click My VA? Does our flow meet expectations?

**My VA vs. the homepage**
- What would people use My VA for vs. what would people use the homepage for?
- If there was no homepage, what would a user need My VA to do that it’s not currently doing?

**Mobile questions**

*Note-these probably aren’t questions we’d ask outright, but more assess by behavior*

- Can people find what they need on mobile?
- Does the page feel too long/like there is too much scrolling required to get to the information they need?

**Nametag**
- What identifiers do people expect to see on this page?
- Can people find their disability rating? Did they notice it in the name tag?

**Profile**
- Where do users think the profile link goes?
- What do they think is the difference is between the profile vs. My VA?

**Claims**
- Do they understand the featured claim is the most recently-updated claim?
- Do they know how many claims and appeals they have total? Is this information helpful to them?
- Do they know how to view the featured claim/all claims?
- Is there information missing — or are there actions missing — from this section?
- What do people expect to happen if they have no claims in progress?

**Health care**
- Did we correctly prioritize information in this section by featuring latest/most recent information? Or, are the CTAs into the tools and update totals more important?
- Can they find “totals” information (i.e. 2 unread messages)? And does this information matter to them?
- Do people understand the latest message (or upcoming appointment or most recent refill) is part of “2 unread messages” (or whatever total) or do they think it’s the latest message + 2 more unread messages (or whatever total)?
- Do people understand they are looking at their most recent prescription refill update? Why do they think they are seeing this prescription vs. another prescription?
- Do people understand how they can get more information about their messages/appointments/prescriptions?
- Do people understand the CTAs will not take them directly to the latest or most recent information? Do they understand CTAs will take them to an overview page?
- Are there other links, CTAs, or information that would be helpful to show in this section?

**Apply for benefits**
- Do people understand that they are looking at applications that they’ve started but not yet submitted? Do they understand what “in progress” means?
- Do people understand how to view an in-progress application?
- Do people understand why we are showing certain benefits in “benefits you might be interested in”?
- Do people think “benefits you might be interested in” are the ONLY benefits they are eligible for?
- Do people understand how to get more information on what benefits the VA offers? Is the information provided helpful to them?

## Overall Findings

1. Users easily found the information that they were looking for and completed tasks. Overall, the information we have on MyVA seems helpful, though users wanted MyVA to be more 'actionable'.
3. There was a tie on preferring the homepage to MyVA (4 to 4), but many participants mentioned how much they appreciated the personalization of MYVA. 
4. Many users mentioned that they did not need the grey boxes in messages and prescriptions, they found it confusing. On the other hand, many users mentioned that the box in appiontments and claims & appeals was useful.
5. No participants had a firm understanding of the 'totals' displayed on the page in all sections. Most users thought that the total was the the information in the grey box PLUS the number in the CTA. Many users also thought that the grey boxes were clickable.
6. All users were confused with the verbiage and information shown in the prescriptions sections. 

### Findings Breakdown

**1. Users easily found the information that they were looking for and completed tasks. Overall, the information we have on MyVA seems helpful, though users wanted MyVA to be more 'actionable'.** Users were able to complete most tasks, even if there was some confusion about specific information (prescriptions, totals and grey boxes). Users had positive feedback about the MyVA page, but users were looking for the page to be more actionable. Users mentioned wanting to see specific CTAs on the page like 'Schedule an appointment' and 'Send message'. There was also some talk about *why* we are showing the information in the grey boxes if they cannot do anything with it. We may want to continue exploring how we can more effectively prompt people to take action.

**2. There was a tie on preferring the homepage to MyVA (4 to 4), but many participants mentioned how much they appreciated the personalization of MYVA.**. Users who preferred the homepage said they appreciated how much you could do on the page. Users who preferred MyVa said they loved how streamlined and personal it was - but both users said they appreciated the personalization of MyVA. Some folks said that there would need to be some additions to MyVA for it to work as a homepage for them. Specifically education benefits and the records section. This further validates the existence of My VA and our pursuit of personalization on VA.gov. 

Additionally, no users were able to find MyVA in the Menu dropdown on their own (could be the way we framed the question) - all users said they would look in the homepage links to find updates to benefits (specifically in the disability section).

**3. Many users mentioned that they did not need the grey boxes in messages and prescriptions, they found it confusing. On the other hand, many users mentioned that the box in appiontments and claims & appeals was useful.**. Users all easily understood that the grey box in claims & appeals was their latest claim update. There were some additional things that users would like to see in the appointments box (i.e. dr name and type of practice), but they appreciated seeing their next appointment so they could keep track of it. Also, soon we will have the functionality to link to a specific appointment which will make that box more actionable. For messages and prescriptions, people found the boxes to be confusing and redundant.  They just wanted to see how many messages they had and manage all of their prescriptions, additional details were not helpful to them.

**4. No participants had a firm understanding of the 'totals' displayed on the page in all sections. Most users thought that the total was the the information in the grey box PLUS the number in the CTA.** There was a lot of confusion around the CTA's and the grey boxes and what their relation was to each other. Some users thought that the total number was displayed in the CTA, but they were often unsure about their assumption. All users understood that the links would take them to a separate page with additional information, but 3 users mentioned they would like to see more specific CTA's on the page (i.e. schedule an appointment, cancel an appointment, send message)

**5. All users were confused with the verbiage and information shown in the prescriptions sections.** Users were very confused about what 'Prescription update' meant. All users did not understand what '3 prescription refills' meant, and many of them did not understand the relationship between the prescription in the grey box and the number in the CTA. Some people thought that the information presented meant that the prescription in the box had 3 refills left, and others thought that the prescription in the grey box was a refill and they had 3 additional refills happening.  


### Additional Insights

1. No users were able to find MyVA in the Menu dropdown on their own. All users said they would look in the homepage links to find updates to benefits. Given that we were using an InVision prototype and not testing in code, it’s unclear whether people easily found things just because we were already on My VA or whether they’d have as easy a time if we started them somewhere else on VA.gov. We should test this in follow-up sessions once My VA is live. 
2. People generally understood the difference between the My VA dashboard and the Profile, and were able to accurately describe the profile in their own words. However, they had a leg up because we asked them this when they were already on My VA. We should continue to explore this differentiation over time so we can make sure we're surfacing the right information in the right places.
3. Overall, MyVa met user expectations.  Since we are using a prototype with dummy information, this may be skewed and we may get more valuable data in coming sessions using real information.
4. Users easily found and understood the disability rating and how to get more information on their disability ratings.


## Task breakdown

### Users easily understood:

**Nametag**

- how to find their disability rating
- where the disability rating would go

**Claims**

- why we were showing the grey box in claims & appeals
- "X claims & appeals in progress" link would take them to a break down with their claims in progress
- how to view all of their claims and appeals
- how to view specific details about their claim

**Healthcare**

- how to find all of their health care information (messages, appointments, prescriptions)
- how to read their latest message
- how to read get to their 'X unread messages'
- why we're showing their next appointment
- CTA's would take them to a separate page with more information

**Apply for benefits** 

- what the applications in progress are
- how to finish and submit an application
- how to apply to for additional benefits
- generally why we are showing what we're showing in 'Benefits you might be interested in'
- how to find more information about additional benefits

### Users were confused about:

**Nametag**

- no confusion

**Claims**

- the total number of claims & appeals

**Healthcare**

- all healthcare totals
- why there is a grey box in messages and prescriptions
- prescription update, users didn't always understand what it was referring too
- prescription refills, specifically how the number of refills related to the information in the grey box
- prescription section in general - users wanted to see a link to see all prescriptions

**Apply for benefits**

- if the benefit we are showing was something they were eligible for
- if the benefit we are showing was a benefit that is underutilized at the VA 
- how to learn more about benefits. Users all eventually found the FAQ, but several mentioned that they would move 'What benefits does the VA offer' up to the top of the page or the top of the section (make it more visible)

### Potential changes

1. Users mentioned things that we may be able to implement in the future including: (listed by most mentioned with the number of participants who mentioned it)
    
    **Overall**
    
    - payment history (6)
    - personal notifications (4)
    - GI Bill information (specifically how much money and time is left) (3)
    - information about home loans (3)
    - direct deposit (2)
    - contact information for the VA for each section (2)

    **Healthcare**

    - specific CTAs (schedule/cancel appointments, send a message) (4)
    - doctor appointments and appointment type to be added to appt boxes (4)
    - when their prescriptions are going to be arriving (2)

    **Apply for Benefits**

    - move 'What benefits does the VA offer' up to the top of the page or the top of the section (make it more visible) (4)
    - eligibility requirements (2)


## Recommendations

1. Remove grey boxes in messages and prescriptions.
2. Break out totals and CTA's into separate elements. 
3. Update CTA verbiage to be more actionable (i.e. Manage all prescriptions) in all sections.
4. Make the 'What benefits does the VA offer' dropdown more visible, or move to the top of section.
5. Eventually add in payment history and a notification hub when time allows.


## Next Steps

1. Make all updates to mobile and desktop prototype 
2. Make all updates on staging
3. Test again with real user information
