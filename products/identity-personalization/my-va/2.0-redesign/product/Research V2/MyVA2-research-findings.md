View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research%20V2/MyVA2-research-plan.md).

## Research Goals 

The goal of this research was to understand user comprehension of the My VA page after a full re-structure and re-design. This includes:

- Overall, is there enough relevant information on the dashboard to be valuable?
- Can the user find the tools and tasks that they are looking for effectively?
- Can the user easily access and understand any personal updates (related to claims, health care, or forms)?
- Is the new dashboard layout more effective than the current My VA page?

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to share a high-fidelity prototype. Users were asked to join using their mobile devices (android, iphone and samsung) - but some joined via a laptop or an ipad.

### Who we talked to

- 8 Veterans
- Ages varied from 35-65 (exact demographics unknown)
- All 8 veterans were currently disabled (ranging from 10%-100%)
- 5 out of 8 veterans were currently enrolled and using health care through the VA
- All 8 veterans were currently receiving some type of benefit (retirement, health care, GI bill etc)
- 4 out of 8 veterans had cognitive considerations
- 8 out of 8 veterans managed their benefits online (using primarily MHV and ebenefits)

### Research questions

**Overall questions**
- Did we correctly prioritize this page?
- Is this page useful? Does it have the information and actions it needs?
- Is there anything they expected to see on My VA that’s missing?
- What do people think My VA is?
- What do people think will happen if they click My VA? Does our flow meet expectations?

**My VA vs. the homepage**
- What would people use My VA for vs. what would people use the homepage for?
- If there was no homepage, what would a user need My VA to do that it’s not currently doing?

**Mobile questions**

*Note-these probably aren’t questions we’d ask outright, but more assess by behavior*

- Can people find what they need on mobile?
- Does the page feel too long/like there is too much scrolling required to get to the information they need?

**Nametag**
- What identifiers do people expect to see on this page?
- Can people find their disability rating? Did they notice it in the name tag?

**Profile**
- Where do users think the profile link goes?
- What do they think is the difference is between the profile vs. My VA?

**Claims**
- Do they understand the featured claim is the most recently-updated claim?
- Do they know how many claims and appeals they have total? Is this information helpful to them?
- Do they know how to view the featured claim/all claims?
- Is there information missing — or are there actions missing — from this section?
- What do people expect to happen if they have no claims in progress?

**Health care**
- Did we correctly prioritize information in this section by featuring latest/most recent information? Or, are the CTAs into the tools and update totals more important?
- Can they find “totals” information (i.e. 2 unread messages)? And does this information matter to them?
- Do people understand the latest message (or upcoming appointment or most recent refill) is part of “2 unread messages” (or whatever total) or do they think it’s the latest message + 2 more unread messages (or whatever total)?
- Do people understand they are looking at their most recent prescription refill update? Why do they think they are seeing this prescription vs. another prescription?
- Do people understand how they can get more information about their messages/appointments/prescriptions?
- Do people understand the CTAs will not take them directly to the latest or most recent information? Do they understand CTAs will take them to an overview page?
- Are there other links, CTAs, or information that would be helpful to show in this section?

**Apply for benefits**
- Do people understand that they are looking at applications that they’ve started but not yet submitted? Do they understand what “in progress” means?
- Do people understand how to view an in-progress application?
- Do people understand why we are showing certain benefits in “benefits you might be interested in”?
- Do people think “benefits you might be interested in” are the ONLY benefits they are eligible for?
- Do people understand how to get more information on what benefits the VA offers? Is the information provided helpful to them?

## Overall Findings: What worked

**1. Users easily found the information that they were looking for and completed tasks. Overall, the information we have on My VA seems helpful, though users wanted My VA to be more 'actionable'.** Users were able to complete most tasks, even if there was some confusion about specific information (prescriptions, totals and grey boxes). Overall, users had positive feedback about the My VA page and stated that they would use it.

> "I like it, I have a similar one for work because I work in finance so it can pinpoint what needs actions, pending or in progress, so it is a one stop shop."

**2. All users stated that My Va met or exceeded their expectations.**  The information presented on the page was what they expected and they could easily find what they were looking for. Since we are using a prototype with dummy information, this may be skewed and we may get more valuable data in coming sessions using real information.

> "I like it, I think it is good. I like that it is phone friendly, they aren’t just information all over the page and you don’t need to scroll through a lot. The UI is designed in a way that is friendly to your eyes and other app developers do their pages. Its not just a spreadsheet that is all on the page. Summery of everything but not crazy extensive."

**3. There was a tie on preferring the homepage to My VA (4 to 4), but many participants mentioned how much they appreciated the personalization of My VA.**. Users who preferred the homepage said they appreciated how much you could do on the page. Users who preferred My VA said they loved how streamlined and personal it was - but both users said they appreciated the personalization of My VA. Some folks said that there would need to be some additions to My VA for it to work as a homepage for them. Specifically education benefits and the records section. This further validates the existence of My VA and our pursuit of personalization on VA.gov. 

> "I think it covers any questions or guide the veteran where to go if they have any questions. I don’t think they could leave this without finding an answer."

**4. People generally understood the difference between the My VA dashboard and the Profile, and were able to accurately describe the profile in their own words.** However, they had a leg up because we asked them this when they were already on My VA. We should continue to explore this differentiation over time so we can make sure we're surfacing the right information in the right places.

**5. All users easily found and understood the disability rating and how to get more information on their disability ratings.**

> "Oh, my disability rating is just right up top - I love that!"

**6. Users found the grey boxes in appointments and claims & appeals to be useful.** Users all easily understood that the grey box in claims & appeals was their latest claim update. There were some additional things that users would like to see in the appointments box (i.e. dr name and type of practice), but they appreciated seeing their next appointment so they could keep track of it. Also, soon we will have the functionality to link to a specific appointment which will make that box more actionable.

> (When asked about the grey box in appointments) "Make you aware of the next appointment so you don’t miss it. That’s the most important thing is the next one so you do not forget and it is a reminder. It is good they put it there." 

**7. Users easily understood the applications in progress section and how to complete and submit an application.** Users understood that this was an application that they had personall started and they all easily stated they would click on the 'continue application' button to complete the application.

## Overall Findings: What didn't work

**1.Users wanted My VA to be more 'actionable'.** Users mentioned wanting to see specific CTAs on the page like 'Schedule an appointment' and 'Send message'. There was also some talk about *why* we are showing the information in the grey boxes if they cannot do anything with it. We may want to continue exploring how we can more effectively prompt people to take action.

> "Give me more interactivity, if I can't do anything about it then I don't want to see it." 

> "Well, where it says appointments I would have schedule and view appointments... if I am already seeing something here then it should allow me to schedule and view at this point instead of going somewhere else to schedule."

- **Recommendation:** Since the specific CTAs that users requested go to the same page (Schedule an appointment' and 'Cancel appointment' will both go to VAOS) - my recommendation is remove the total number from the CTA's and to update the verbiage of the CTA in all sections to be something along the lines of 'Manage all X'.   

**2. No participants had a firm understanding of the 'totals' displayed on the page in all sections. Most users thought that the total was the the information in the grey box PLUS the number in the CTA.** There was a lot of confusion around the CTA's and the grey boxes and what their relation was to each other. Some users thought that the total number was displayed in the CTA, but they were often unsure about their assumption. All users understood that the links would take them to a separate page with additional information, but 3 users mentioned they would like to see more specific CTA's on the page (i.e. schedule an appointment, cancel an appointment, send message)

- **Recommendation:** I recommend removing the total number from the CTA's and having the totals be a separate element. I also recommend exploring some updates to the copy to reflect that we are showing the total number - i.e. 9 total upcoming appointments. That secondary piece might not be necessary since a lot of the confusion revolved around the relation of the grey box with the totals, that's something we can test again in the future.  

**3. Many users mentioned that they did not need the grey boxes in messages and prescriptions, they found it confusing and redundant.**  They just wanted to see how many messages they had and have the ability to see all of the information about their prescriptions and manage that information, additional details were not helpful to them.

> "That is all I would really care about...(referring to the message total) is that I have a response or that I need to read the messages in regard to whatever I've been waiting for."
> "Get rid of the grey box, I don't need it. I just want to get to where I can do something. Make it linkable."

- **Recommendation:** I recommend removing the grey boxes in messages and prescriptions - this will cut down on confusion on 'totals' as well. 

**4. All users were confused with the verbiage and information shown in the prescriptions sections.** Users were very confused about what 'Prescription update' meant. All users did not understand what '3 prescription refills' meant, and many of them did not understand the relationship between the prescription in the grey box and the number in the CTA. Some people thought that the information presented meant that the prescription in the box had 3 refills left, and others thought that the prescription in the grey box was a refill and they had 3 additional refills happening.  

> "Well see... when I looked at it I didn’t know if it meant it was three refills of metformin or if I have other prescriptions that are in a refill status. For example, I get Vitamin D and one other so that is three refills right there... would it give me the status of all of them or is that just for metformin? I honestly just don't know."

**Recommendation:** I recommend removing the grey box in prescriptions as well as not displaying a total for prescriptions. With our current functionality, we cannot show users what is really useful to them (i.e. when their prescription will arrive or if they need to take action on a prescription). I recommend the prescription section should just be a simple link to 'Manage all prescriptions'.  This should remove all confusion around this section while still quickly and effectively getting users to their prescription information. 

**5. No users were able to find My VA in the Menu dropdown on their own. All users said they would look in the homepage links to find updates to benefits.** Given that we were using an InVision prototype and not testing in code, it’s unclear whether people easily found things just because we were already on My VA or whether they’d have as easy a time if we started them somewhere else on VA.gov. We should test this in follow-up sessions once My VA is live. 

- **Recommendation:** I do not have an immediate recommendation at this time, this needs to be tested further since we cannot fully assess if this was because of where users started in the prototype.

**6. Users generally understood the 'Apply for benefits' section, but were confused about why we were showing the benefit in 'Benefits you might be interested in'.** People understood that this was a benefit that they were not currently recieving. There was some confusion around *why* we were showing it, but this wasn't a massive usability issue on the page overall.  Some people thought that maybe it had something to do with their eligibility, but people generally understood that this was something the VA wanted to get in front of them.

Also, multiple users mentioned wanting the 'What benefits does the VA offer' dropdown be made more visible. 

> "'What benefits does the VA offer'... but I would move that to the top because it gets lost. Maybe on the right hand side a resource tab, it may be harder on the phone, I am desktop oriented but it is rare that I would get down this far."

- **Recommendation:** I recommend moving the 'What benefits does the VA offer' dropdown up further on the page or make it more visibile visually. As far as the confusion around why we were showing the benefit in 'Benefits you might be interested in'- no changes need to be made here. This was not a usability issue, users will still be able to sign up for additional benefits as needed. 

## Features users expected to see that were missing

Users mentioned things that we may be able to implement in the future including: (listed by most mentioned with the number of participants who mentioned it)
    
   **Overall**
    
   - payment history (6)
   - personal notifications (4)
   - GI Bill information (specifically how much money and time is left) (3)
   - information about home loans (3)
   - direct deposit (2)
   - contact information for the VA for each section (2)

   **Healthcare**

   - specific CTAs (schedule/cancel appointments, send a message) (4)
   - doctor appointments and appointment type to be added to appt boxes (4)
   - when their prescriptions are going to be arriving (2)

   **Apply for Benefits**

   - move 'What benefits does the VA offer' up to the top of the page or the top of the section (make it more visible) (4)
   - eligibility requirements (2)


## Task breakdown

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

### Users were confused about:

**Nametag**

- no confusion

**Claims**

- the total number of claims & appeals

**Healthcare**

- all healthcare totals
- why there is a grey box in messages and prescriptions
- prescription update, users didn't always understand what it was referring too
- prescription refills, specifically how the number of refills related to the information in the grey box
- prescription section in general - users wanted to see a link to see all prescriptions

**Apply for benefits**

- if the benefit we are showing was something they were eligible for
- if the benefit we are showing was a benefit that is underutilized at the VA 
- how to learn more about benefits. Users all eventually found the FAQ, but several mentioned that they would move 'What benefits does the VA offer' up to the top of the page or the top of the section (make it more visible)

<details>


## Recommendations

1. Remove grey boxes in messages and prescriptions.
2. Remove the 'total' in the prescription section and replace with a 'Manage all prescriptions' CTA
3. Break out totals and CTA's into separate elements. 
4. Update totals verbiage to more clearly reflect a 'total'.
5. Update CTA verbiage to be more actionable (i.e. Manage all prescriptions) in all sections.
6. Make the 'What benefits does the VA offer' dropdown more visible, or move to the top of section.
7. Eventually add in payment history and a notification hub when time/functionality allows.


## Next Steps

1. Make all updates to mobile and desktop prototype 
2. Make all updates on staging
3. Test again with real user information
