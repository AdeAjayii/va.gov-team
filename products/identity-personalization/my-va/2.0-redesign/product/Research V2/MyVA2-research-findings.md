## Research Goals 

The goal of this research was to understand user comprehension of the MyVA page after a full re-structure and re-design. This includes:

- Overall, is there enough relevant information on the dashboard to be valuable?
- Can the user find the tools and tasks that they are looking for effectively?
- Can the user easily access and understand any personal updates (related to claims, health care, or forms)?
- Is the new dashboard layout more effective than the current MyVA page?

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to share a high-fidelity prototype. Users were asked to join using their mobile devices (android, iphone and samsung) - but some joined via a laptop or an ipad.

### Who we talked to

- 8 Veterans
- Ages varied from 35-65 (exact demographics unknown)
- All 8 veterans were currently disabled (ranging from 10%-100%)
- 5 out of 8 veterans were currently enrolled and using health care through the VA
- All 8 veterans were currently receiving some type of benefit (retirement, health care, GI bill etc)
- 4 out of 8 veterans had cognitive considerations
- 8 out of 8 veterans managed their benefits online (using primarily MHV and ebenefits)

### Research questions

**Overall questions**
- Did we correctly prioritize this page?
- Is this page useful? Does it have the information and actions it needs?
- Is there anything they expected to see on My VA that’s missing?
- What do people think My VA is?
- What do people think will happen if they click My VA? Does our flow meet expectations?

**My VA vs. the homepage**
- What would people use My VA for vs. what would people use the homepage for?
- If there was no homepage, what would a user need My VA to do that it’s not currently doing?

**Mobile questions**

*Note-these probably aren’t questions we’d ask outright, but more assess by behavior*

- Can people find what they need on mobile?
- Does the page feel too long/like there is too much scrolling required to get to the information they need?

**Nametag**
- What identifiers do people expect to see on this page?
- Can people find their disability rating? Did they notice it in the name tag?

**Profile**
- Where do users think the profile link goes?
- What do they think is the difference is between the profile vs. My VA?

**Claims**
- Do they understand the featured claim is the most recently-updated claim?
- Do they know how many claims and appeals they have total? Is this information helpful to them?
- Do they know how to view the featured claim/all claims?
- Is there information missing — or are there actions missing — from this section?
- What do people expect to happen if they have no claims in progress?

**Health care**
- Did we correctly prioritize information in this section by featuring latest/most recent information? Or, are the CTAs into the tools and update totals more important?
- Can they find “totals” information (i.e. 2 unread messages)? And does this information matter to them?
- Do people understand the latest message (or upcoming appointment or most recent refill) is part of “2 unread messages” (or whatever total) or do they think it’s the latest message + 2 more unread messages (or whatever total)?
- Do people understand they are looking at their most recent prescription refill update? Why do they think they are seeing this prescription vs. another prescription?
- Do people understand how they can get more information about their messages/appointments/prescriptions?
- Do people understand the CTAs will not take them directly to the latest or most recent information? Do they understand CTAs will take them to an overview page?
- Are there other links, CTAs, or information that would be helpful to show in this section?

**Apply for benefits**
- Do people understand that they are looking at applications that they’ve started but not yet submitted? Do they understand what “in progress” means?
- Do people understand how to view an in-progress application?
- Do people understand why we are showing certain benefits in “benefits you might be interested in”?
- Do people think “benefits you might be interested in” are the ONLY benefits they are eligible for?
- Do people understand how to get more information on what benefits the VA offers? Is the information provided helpful to them?

## Findings

1. All users said they would look in the homepage links to find updates to benefits (specifically in the disability section)

### Overall

1. Users easily found the information that they were looking for and completed tasks. Overall, the information we have on MyVA seems helpful.
2. There was a tie on preferring the homepage to MyVA (4 to 4), but many participants mentioned how much they appreciated the personalization of MYVA. 
3. Users wanted MyVA to be more actionable. Users found the grey boxes in prescriptions and messages to be not useful, while the grey boxes in appointments and claims to be very useful. Some users thought the grey boxes were clickable.
4. No participants had a firm understanding of the 'totals' displayed on the page. Most users thought that the total was the the information in the grey box PLUS the number in the CTA. Many users also thought that the grey boxes were clickable.

### Users easily understood:

**Nametag**

- how to find their disability rating
- where the disability rating would go

**Claims**

- why we were showing the grey box in claims & appeals
- "X claims & appeals in progress" link would take them to a break down with their claims in progress
- how to view all of their claims and appeals
- how to view specific details about their claim

**Healthcare**

- how to find all of their health care information (messages, appointments, prescriptions)
- how to read their latest message
- how to read get to their 'X unread messages'
- why we're showing their next appointment
- CTA's would take them to a separate page with more information

**Apply for benefits** 

- what the applications in progress are
- how to finish and submit an application
- how to apply to for additional benefits
- generally why we are showing what we're showing in 'Benefits you might be interested in'
- how to find more information about additional benefits

### Users were confused about:

**Nametag**

- no confusion

**Claims**

- the total number of claims & appeals

**Healthcare**

- all healthcare totals
- why there is a grey box in messages and prescriptions
- prescription update, users didn't always understand what it was referring too
- prescription refills, specifically how the number of refills related to the information in the grey box
- prescription section in general - users wanted to see a link to see all prescriptions

**Apply for benefits**

- if the benefit we are showing was something they were eligible for
- if the benefit we are showing was a benefit that is underutilized at the VA 
- how to learn more about benefits. Users all eventually found the FAQ, but several mentioned that they would move 'What benefits does the VA offer' up to the top of the page or the top of the section (make it more visible)


## Details of Findings

### Overall

**1. Users easily found the information that they were looking for and overall, the information we have on MyVA seems helpful.** Users were able to complete most tasks, even if there was some confusion about specific information (prescriptions, totals and grey boxes). Users had positive feedback about the MyVA page, and even though there was a tie on preferring the homepage to MyVA (4 to 4), many participants mentioned how much they appreciated the personalization of MYVA and they don't want the VA to show things that don't apply to them. This further validates the existence of My VA and our pursuit of personalization on VA.gov. However, It will likely work less well to prompt people to do things. We may want to continue exploring how we can more effectively prompt people to take action.

> "It all makes sense to me, it makes more sense than what we got right now, this is going to be easier to find out things. It all seems to be right here."

> "I mean to be honest this covers the main things. Appointments, messages, prescription refills, accessing the medical history is very useful because you have to click a lot of times and having it there is important. I can tell you there’s nothing more stressful then click on different tabs to find the medical history but having it there easy to access is useful.

> "They both met my expectations by providing a lot of information and being readable. I don’t have a problem with either one."

**2. There was a tie on preferring the homepage to MyVA (4 to 4), but many participants mentioned how much they appreciated the personalization of MYVA.**. Users don't want the VA to show things that don't apply to them. This further validates the existence of My VA and our pursuit of personalization on VA.gov. However, It will likely work less well to prompt people to do things. We may want to continue exploring how we can more effectively prompt people to take action.  No users were able to find MyVA in the Menu dropdown on their own (could be the way we framed the question) - all users said they would look in the homepage links to find updates to benefits (specifically in the disability section)

> "As it relates to the updates, I would hope to see information that is time sensitive be first. There are explanation marks that are important but that is more of 'hey, look at this, it is important', but it's not in an order that I feel would be conducive if you have multiple notification if they have been checked. Having the ones with explanation marks or prioritized in a way that is the most important to the person or the doctor first."

> "I like it a lot. It is straight and to the point, not to much writing or reading. It provides the ability to access important information, but not straight when I access the page so I can go somewhere private to access may medical information."

**3. Users found the information provided in the updates and other sections of the prototypes to be redundant.** There was some confusion about the information architecture - users didn't know what information was the most important on the page and were confused by updates being pulled out of subcategories.

> "I like that you have the updates in a different color but I think they should be under the subcategory."

> "I would have the appointments, messages, prescriptions and the have the grey boxes under that then maybe the upcoming appointments. You see the grey boxes then these upcoming appointments, message, and prescriptions. It is a little redundant seeing it this way. This is kind of like a red flag without a flag, they are the important things."

> " It seems redundant because there is one claim and then you can go to recent claims... why would we need to go to recent claim if we can go to overview and see the same information? We don’t need all the other stuff if we can go to an overview.

> "The grey boxes (updates) are redundant to the blocks about the appointments, messages and prescriptions. I don’t know if the grey boxes (updates) will do anything differently than going straight to the blocks."

**4. Users did not understand the hierarchy of the information shown in the updates.** Users did not understand how the updates were being displayed (chronological, level of urgency, etc). Participants mentioned that the most important updates to see are messages from their doctor, any changes in appointments or upcoming appointments.  Claim status changes are important to see, but are often not time-sensitive so they preferred to not have those updates at the top of the page.

> "The 4 new updates... if you look at the dates, how are they ordered? Are they by section? Or are they by date? I am not really sure."

> "I am not sure if they are in order due to importance or not, but just looking at it at face value it is information that is important... but it's kind of confusing."

> "I want to see the messages from the provider and the upcoming appointments. The claim updates aren’t as important because they are not as time sensitive as upcoming appointments and messages."

**5. Overall, users said they would use the overview page and would find it useful.** Participants had very positive feedback on both prototypes, specifically mentioning that they didn't have to login to multiple places to see an overview of their information. 

> "For sure it would work for me because this is a one stop shop to notify me what is available at the time and if I wanted to inquire more I can click on them to access it on another page. Because it is a cellphone and not a tablet a lot of the information must be smaller so to have it quick and to the point is something I prefer." 

> "...having easy access to the information on my own time without jumping through hoops is important to me."

> "It is better than I thought it would be. It seems like it will be a lot easier once it is up and running. It is a lot better than I thought it would be. I thought it would be a page that you have to enter 15 times then see things but if we can put it in once and see everything that is fantastic."


## Additional Insights

1. Users had a wide range of titles for this page including: Vital information, MyVA, My dashboard, My landing page
2. Users mentioned things that we may be able to implement in the future including:
    - scheduling C&P exams
    - tracking prescription packages
    - any annual health reminders (i.e. flu shots, physicals)
    - prescription reminders
    - adding appointments to a mobile calendar
    - dependent information
    - payment totals
    - current/pending referrals
    - customizing their personal page

3. There was confusion around the 'Go to recent updates' link - many participants assumed this would take them to a full overview page, not the specific claim or message etc.
4. Users thought that the benefit applications section and claims and appeals section should live together or closer together.
5. Users mentioned that they would like to see a 'wellness' tab - with diet and exercise recommendations.

## Recommendations

1. Pursue a direction that shows users set information about their benefits/health care each time they come to the site to reduce the redundancy of information shown.
2. Compile all 'updates' into each specific subcategory instead of having a dedicated 'updates' section.
3. Add some more information in each section where possible. The minimum is outlined below.
    - Claims needs title, date and status
    - Messages needs sent from (name), sent from (clinic), date, subject
    - Appointments needs appointment type, medical practice type, location, location details  date, time, contact information
4. Work with copy to update verbiage around prescriptions and 'Go to all' links.

## Next Steps

1. Update all mobile wireframes
2. Create desktop versions
3. Update UI design on all versions
4. Test again
