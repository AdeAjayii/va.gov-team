# What are the jobs of My VA?

As part of our [DEPO conversations on 12.2.20 about the My VA purpose and design direction](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/newsfeed-or-dashboard-approach.md), Sabrina posed the following question: What are the jobs My VA is supposed to accomplish (she also shared [this article](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done) which further elaborates on what that means)?

# Overall page direction

The original question that prompted this review was around which design approach we should take for the dashboard: more of a newsfeed approach (show all updates, notifications, and requests) vs. a traditional dashboard approach (shows users set information about their benefits each time they come to the site). While either approach could be made to fit the jobs of the page, I think **the traditional dashboard approach** accomplishes the jobs better for the following reasons:
