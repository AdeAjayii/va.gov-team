# What are the jobs of My VA?

As part of our [DEPO conversations on 12.2.20 about the My VA purpose and design direction](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/newsfeed-or-dashboard-approach.md), Sabrina posed the following question: What are the jobs My VA is supposed to accomplish (she also shared [this article](https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done) which further elaborates on what that means)? We know people log in to complete tasks specific to their benefits, but this got me thinking more specifically about what users come to do, what My VA should do, and also what My VA is not responsible for doing.

## What users come to do

### High level user goals

From countless user interviews that have been done over the years, we know people come to VA.gov to complete tasks specific to their benefits. We also know that people want to see information that is personally relevant to them, and they don't want to be bogged down by links or suggestions that don't apply to them. As a result, we already have these user goals defined in the [My VA redesign our product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/README.md):

- As a veteran, I want to be able to log in to VA.gov and easily find the tools and tasks that apply to my specific experience at the VA.
- As a veteran, I want to be able to log in to VA.gov and easily see status updates and notifications that apply to my specific experience at the VA.
- As a veteran, I want to be able to log in to VA.gov, quickly complete whatever I came to do, and then get back to the rest of my life.

### More specific user goals

But what does this actually mean? What are these "tasks that apply to my specific experience at the VA" (aka the jobs)? We know the following from [our My VA discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md) (note: Many of these findings are also supported in [previous user research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md)):

- As a veteran, I want to see if the VA is going to give me the financial compensation I have earned. I do this by:
  - Checking to see if my disability claim has been updated or accepted.
  - Checking to see if my disability rating has changed (so a proxy metric for whether the claim has been accepted or not).
  - Checking to see if my GI bill benefits have been paid out, and what my balance is. 

- As a veteran with VA health care, I want to manage my health online. I do this by:
  - Refilling prescriptions online, and checking to see if that refill has been issued.
  - Sending messages to my medical team and checking to see if anyone has replied.
  - Managing my VA health appointments.

- As a veteran, I want to easily be able to access my personal documents so I can use them to apply for other benefits, prove I am a veteran to an outside group, etc.

- As a veteran, I want to learn what other VA benefits I am entitled to that I do not already receive, and what other VA services might be offered to me.

## What My VA should do

Based on the jobs users come to do, this is what I see as the jobs of My VA:

# Overall page direction

The original question that prompted this review was around which design approach we should take for the dashboard: more of a newsfeed approach (show all updates, notifications, and requests) vs. a traditional dashboard approach (shows users set information about their benefits each time they come to the site). While either approach could be made to fit the jobs of the page, I think **the traditional dashboard approach** accomplishes the jobs better for the following reasons:
