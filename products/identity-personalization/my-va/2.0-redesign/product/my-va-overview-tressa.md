# My VA project overview

There was a lot of ambiguity in this project (shifting of timelines, expectations and parameters, technical constraints)  - so the PM and I put together a couple documents to make sure all stakeholders were on the same page as we set about understanding what would make this redesign successful. We would revisit these periodically throughout the project and make updates. Also after every meeting, I would type up a 'What we understand' document and go over it with the client to make sure we were on the same page - it was time consuming but really helped to field any questions and alleviate frustrations early.

There was a lot of confusion about what *should* be included and what *could* be included. In order to do that, we needed to understand what information currently existed, and what information we needed to add and where it came from.

From start to finish, we ran a lot of different research - including a comparative analysis,
