### Phase 1: Adding personalized application, claim, and benefit info to the logged-in homepage; Retiring My VA

When considering next steps, we had to think about what would both be a manageable first step and what would elevate personalized, task-based information. While the easiest next step — removing links from the top 20 tasks that do not apply to individual users when they log in – would be manageable, we did not feel it would adequately elevate the personal information veterans repeatedly stated they wanted to see.

Instead, we landed on an approach that would port existing application, claim, and benefit information over from My VA to the logged-in homepage.

#### In scope

-	Moving the applications, claims, and benefit content on My VA to the logged-in homepage.
-	A visual redesign of the My VA elements moving over to the logged-in homepage.
-	A plan for how to include links to the existing top 20 tasks, which would include how to direct veterans to the records and documents.
-	A very basic first-time user experience that will account for users who have no benefits and no applications in flight.
-	Retiring My VA.
-	(Nice to have) Elevating overall disability ratings or GI bill balances.

#### Out of scope

-	Doing anything with the Find VA benefits content that currently exists on My VA.
-	Incorporating any new data or integrations that do not already exist on VA.gov.
-	Navigation work.
-	Notification center work.

### Phase 2: Improvements

Phase 2 will allow us to make updates and modifications to phase 1. Many of these may come out of ideas generated during phase 1 or analytics we observe. This might include:

-	Disability rating info if it’s not included in phase 1.
-	GI bill balance info if it’s not included in phase 1.
-	Considering whether some tasks can be completed right from the homepage, and implementing functionality to allow this.
-	Showing new data, or data in a different way (eg. could we show where a prescription is en route?).
-	Additional features that are deemed valuable (eg. most recent payments, housing grant balance, etc).

### Phase 3: A better first-time user experience and recommendations

While we will need to consider what we show if someone has no benefits and nothing in progress in phase 1, there will likely be room for growth and improvement for first-time user flows beyond what we implement initially. 

This also opens us up to answer the question  — how are we recommending next steps to all veterans regardless of where they are in their lifecycle? This is where we’ll focus phase 3, which might include:

-	Figuring out how to update the existing Find VA benefits flow.
-	A more fully-developed first-time user experience.
-	Additional benefit suggestions or recommendations based on personal circumstances (Eg. elevating voc rehab if we see you have a disability rating).
