# My VA Dashboard 2.0 Release Plan

## Phase I: UAT
### Planning:
- **Desired date range or test duration:** Exact dates TBD (ideally 5/19 - 6/1)
- **UAT Go/No go:** 
- **Desired number of users:** 10, 5 who receive or are currently eligible to receive health care from VA, 5 who have active claims or appeals; 3 of these 10 need to have a disability rating
- **How you'll recruit the right production test users:** We will recruit users via Perigean.
- **How you'll conduct the testing:** We will conduct UAT over Zoom to ensure the different features work correctly.
- **How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov:** The feature will
be behind a feature flag.
