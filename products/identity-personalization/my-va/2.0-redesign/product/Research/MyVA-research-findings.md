## Research Goals 

This research is to compare two mobile versions of the My VA dashboard re-design and gain feedback on the preferred wireframe direction.  Each version (A and B) contains the same information, just structured differently. We are trying to understand which direction makes the most sense to users. This includes:

- overall, is there enough relevant information on the dashboard to be valuable
- can the user quickly find the information that they are looking for 
- does the page structure (scrolling vs navigation) affect ease of visibility
- can the user easily access and understand any personal updates (claims, health care, or forms)
- how easily can the user navigate to the sections they are looking for
- is the new dashboard layout more effective than the current MyVA page

*Note - This was a preference test, **not** an A/B test

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype (mobile A & B versions). All users joined using their mobile devices (android, iphone and samsung).

### Who we talked to

- 8 Veterans
- Ages varied from 35-65 (exact demographics unknown)
- 7 out of 8 veterans were currently disabled (ranging from 10%-100%)
- 6 out of 8 veterans were currently enrolled and using health care through the VA
- All 8 veterans were currently receiving some type of benefit (retirement, health care, GI bill etc)
- 1 out of 8 veterans had cognitive considerations

### Research Questions

- Do Veterans prefer design version A or B?
- Is there any confusion caused by the status update styles in A vs B design?
- Can people find what they're looking for on the dashboard?
- Does the placement of the disability rating make sense to users?
- In the claims and health care sections, do users understand what is being displayed? Is it enough information?
- What information is important for them to see first?
- What information related to health care, claims and applications/benefits do users want to see?
- Is any information missing on the dashboard?
- Do users expect to see more information on a desktop view?
- How do people think the new dashboard compares to the current MyVA?
- What updates are most important to users?
- Do people want to see all of their most recent updates?

### A Design specific questions

- Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?
- Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?
- Do users want to see updates grouped all together?

### B Design specific questions
- Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?
- Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?
- Do users want to see updates in each specific section?
- Can people easily find what they are looking for with information collapsed in accordions?
