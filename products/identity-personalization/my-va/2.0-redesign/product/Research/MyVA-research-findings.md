## Research Goals 

This research was to compare two mobile versions of the My VA dashboard re-design and gain feedback on the preferred wireframe direction.  Each version (A and B) contains the same information, just structured differently. We were trying to understand which direction makes the most sense to users. This includes:

- overall, is there enough relevant information on the dashboard to be valuable
- can the user quickly find the information that they are looking for 
- does the page structure (scrolling vs navigation) affect ease of visibility
- can the user easily access and understand any personal updates (claims, health care, or forms)
- how easily can the user navigate to the sections they are looking for
- is the new dashboard layout more effective than the current MyVA page

*Note - This was a preference test, **not** an A/B test

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype (mobile A & B versions). All users joined using their mobile devices (android, iphone and samsung).

### Who we talked to

- 8 Veterans
- Ages varied from 35-65 (exact demographics unknown)
- 7 out of 8 veterans were currently disabled (ranging from 10%-100%)
- 6 out of 8 veterans were currently enrolled and using health care through the VA
- All 8 veterans were currently receiving some type of benefit (retirement, health care, GI bill etc)
- 1 out of 8 veterans had cognitive considerations

### Research Questions

- Do Veterans prefer design version A or B?
- Is there any confusion caused by the status update styles in A vs B design?
- Can people find what they're looking for on the dashboard?
- Does the placement of the disability rating make sense to users?
- In the claims and health care sections, do users understand what is being displayed? Is it enough information?
- What information is important for them to see first?
- What information related to health care, claims and applications/benefits do users want to see?
- Is any information missing on the dashboard?
- Do users expect to see more information on a desktop view?
- How do people think the new dashboard compares to the current MyVA?
- What updates are most important to users?
- Do people want to see all of their most recent updates?

### A Design specific questions

- Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?
- Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?
- Do users want to see updates grouped all together?

### B Design specific questions
- Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?
- Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?
- Do users want to see updates in each specific section?
- Can people easily find what they are looking for with information collapsed in accordions?

## Key Findings

### Overall

1. Users preferred whatever prototype they saw first. As far as completing tasks efficiently - there was no clear 'winner'. Users were easily able to complete tasks/find information in both versions. 
2. Users do not expect to see *all* their information on an overview page - they want to see any time-sensitive information or action items and all other details can live on a separate page.
3. Users found the information provided in the updates and other sections of the prototypes to be redundant.
4. Users did not understand the hierarchy of the information shown in the updates.
5. Overall, users said they would use the overview page and would find it useful.

### Claims & appeals

1. Users easily understood the placement and link of the disability rating.
2. Users are looking for any status changes to claims, all other information can live on a separate page. 

### Health care

1. Users would like to see what type of healthcare they are enrolled in (vision, dental, etc.).
2. Participants wanted to see the facility that new messages were from, as well as the doctor's name. 
3. Users wanted to see additional details concerning their appointments - specifically location details and type of appointment (dermatology etc.).
4. Users were confused by the verbiage 'prescription refills' - they didn't know if it was currently filled or if they needed to take action

### Benefit applications

1. Users did not know if the benefits shown in the 'Benefit applications' section were suggestions from the VA, forms they had already started, or forms they needed to fill out.

## Details of Findings
List details of each finding in top findings here, with supporting quotes when possible.

## Additional Insights
1. Users mentioned a few things that we may be able to implement in the future including scheduling C&P exams, tracking prescription packages and dependent information. 
2. Users thought that the benefit applications section and claims and appeals section should live together or closer together.
