# Research Plan for VSA Authenticated Experience: MyVA Redesign November 2020
Prepared by Tressa Furner and Cassandra Allen, Ad Hoc & GCIO | November 2020

## Goals

The goal of this research is to understand what information/how much information needs to be elevated on the MyVA Dashboard 2.0 page. We also aim to understand which page structure (i.e. information hierarchy, update layout etc.) makes the most sense to Veterans. This includes:

- can the user find the information that they are looking for effectively
- does the page structure (scrolling vs navigation) affect ease of visibility
- can the user easily access and understand any personal updates (claims, healthcare, or forms)
- how easily can the user navigate to the sections they are looking for
- is the new dashboard layout more effective than the current MyVA page

## Background

The [My VA Dashboard 2.0](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/README.md) effort aims to: 

- Reduce redundancy
- Elevate personal information
- Scale gracefully 
- Prioritize wayfinding
- Effectively use visual space

The goal of the My VA Dashboard 2.0 is to essentially surface a Veteran's personalized information so they can more easily navigate to sections like Claims or Healthcare. This is based of research from the [Personalization 2.0 discovery write-up (2019)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md) and [Logged-in homepage discovery write-up (Spring 2020)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md)

## Research questions
 
- Can people find what they're looking for on the dashboard?
- Overall, is there enough relevant information on the dashboard to be valuable?
- Does the placement of the disability rating make sense to users?
- In the claims and healthcare sections, do users understand what is being displayed? Is it enough information?
- What information is important for them to see first?
- Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?
- Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?
- Do users think the updates are valuable?
- What updates are most important to users?
- Which update structure do users prefer?
- Do people want to see all of their most recent updates?
- Do users want to see their upcoming appointments on the dashboard?
- What information related to healthcare do users want to see?
- What information related to claims do users want to see?
- What information related to applications in progress/benefits do users want to see?
- What information is missing on the dashboard?
- Can people easily find what they are looking for without a navigation?
- Do users expect to see more information on a desktop view?
- How do people think the new dashboard compares to the current MyVA? 

## Hypothesis 

- Users might be confused about update structure
- Participants will be able to address surfaced updates easily
- People will want to see more detailed personalized information than what is shown (i.e. upcoming appointments)
- The new myVA dashboard layout will overall be intuitive and scannable

## Method

- We will conduct an internal heuristic analysis with accessibility, development and platform to ensure that the design is viable.

- We will use Zoom to conduct remote moderated usability testing sessions.  We will be using primarily mobile views in InVision.

### Participants and Recruitment

We will work with Perigean to reach our goal of observing 8-10 participants.

Criteria for recruiting:

- 10 sessions scheduled
- At least 5 participants with healthcare through the VA (**Do we need participants that have appointments or prescriptions or messages?**)
- At least 5 participants with current or previous claims through the VA
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 person of color
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least 1 person with cognitive disabilities
- Be able to screenshare via Zoom. Please confirm with them that they have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screenshare. If they can not get Zoom working, there is no interview portion of this research and they will not be able to participate.

## Timeline 	
This study will take place on TBD.
Each session will be approximately 60 minutes.
	
### Team Availability (EST)

A pilot session will be held on TBD
Pilot participant: TBD

# Updated version based on research plan template

## Goals
This research is to usability test two mobile versions of the My VA dashboard re-design and gain feedback on the preferred design direction (A vs. B).

## Background
Our goal is to create a My VA dashboard design that will improve the online experience for Veterans, by better integrating Veteran-provided data onto the My VA dashboard. Our MVP will focus on surfacing their healthcare and claims information into widgets and notificaitons to help Veterans access their critical information and to take action on status updates.

## Research questions
* Do Veterans prefer design version A or B?
* Is there any confusion caused by the status update styles in A vs B design?

## Hypothesis & assumptions
* Version B will be more successful than version A.
This is because version B organizes status updates under each category and is more scan-able for the user using an accordion style design. While version A has all of the status updates at the top of the page, is more wordy and its less clear which status update is for which category. Version A has a long scrolling page design instead of a more scan-able accordion style design.

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype (mobile and A & B versions) to confirm if our My VA dashboard design is easily usable by Veterans.

## Participants and Recruitment
Recruit for 12 fulfilled sessions (showing each user versions A & B) using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants
* Have you signed up for and used VA healthcare and claims in the last year? (pass = yes)
    * If healthcare or claims users  are too difficult to recruit for, then expand to having used My VA within the last year.

### Good to have for participants
* At least one iOS mobile device owner
* At least one Android mobile device owner
* At least 1 woman
* At least 1 person of color
* At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
* At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
* At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
* At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
* At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
* At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
* At least one person with an identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI

### Recruitment requirements
* All (half) must have a mobile device and be willing to be complete the test on said device
* The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
* The participants know how to screen-share.
This study requires participants to the healthcare, claims, appeals and disability , in order to click through a prototype. It will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.
