# Research Plan for VSA Authenticated Experience: MyVA Redesign November 2020

## Goals
This research is to usability test two mobile versions of the My VA dashboard re-design and gain feedback on the preferred design direction (A vs. B). This includes:

- can the user find the information that they are looking for effectively
- does the page structure (scrolling vs navigation) affect ease of visibility
- can the user easily access and understand any personal updates (claims, healthcare, or forms)
- how easily can the user navigate to the sections they are looking for
- is the new dashboard layout more effective than the current MyVA page

## Background
Our goal is to create a My VA dashboard design that will improve the online experience for Veterans, by better integrating Veteran-provided data onto the My VA dashboard. Our MVP will focus on surfacing their healthcare and claims information into widgets and notifications to help Veterans access their critical information and to take action on status updates.

## Research questions
- Do Veterans prefer design version A or B?
- Is there any confusion caused by the status update styles in A vs B design?
- Can people find what they're looking for on the dashboard?
- Overall, is there enough relevant information on the dashboard to be valuable?
- Does the placement of the disability rating make sense to users?
- In the claims and healthcare sections, do users understand what is being displayed? Is it enough information?
- What information is important for them to see first?
- What information related to healthcare, claims and applications/benefits do users want to see?
- Is any information missing on the dashboard?
- Do users expect to see more information on a desktop view?
- How do people think the new dashboard compares to the current MyVA?
- What updates are most important to users?
- Do people want to see all of their most recent updates?

### A Design questions

- Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?
- Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?
- Do users want to see updates grouped all together?

### B Design questions
- Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?
- Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?
- Do users want to see updates in each specific section?
- Can people easily find what they are looking for with information collapsed in accordions?


## Hypothesis & assumptions
* Version B will be more successful than version A.
This is because version B organizes status updates under each category and is more scan-able for the user using an accordion style design. While version A has all of the status updates at the top of the page, is more wordy and its less clear which status update is for which category. Version A has a long scrolling page design instead of a more scan-able accordion style design.

Other assumptions include:

- Overall users will be able to see and understand the update section
- People will want to see more detailed personalized information than what is shown (i.e. upcoming appointments)
- The new myVA dashboard layout will overall be intuitive and scan-able

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow us to share a high-fidelity wireframe prototype (mobile A & B versions).

## Participants and Recruitment
Recruit for 12 fulfilled sessions (showing each user versions A & B) using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants
* Either have VA healthcare or claims (pass = yes)
    * If healthcare or claims users are too difficult to recruit for, then expand to having used logged in to va.gov within the last year.

### Good to have for participants
* At least one iOS mobile device owner
* At least one Android mobile device owner
* At least 1 woman
* At least 1 person of color
* At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
* At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
* At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
* At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
* At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
* At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
* At least one person with an identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI

### Recruitment requirements
* Half must have a mobile device and be willing to be complete the test on said device
* The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
* The participants know how to screen-share.

We will not be able to accommodate non-sighted users due to the prototype technology.
