[Session Notes]() 

[Mural Board]() 

This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Research Questions & Answers

**Do Veterans prefer design version A or B?**
 - All participants (except for one) preferred the version that they saw first.
 
**Is there any confusion caused by the status update styles in A vs B design?**
 - Most participants easily understood the style of the updates
 - There was confusion around how the updates were ordered
 - Some participants were confused by the hierarchy of the updates
 - Multiple people felt that the updates were redundant.
 - One participant who has cognitive issues was worried she would forget her updates in version A when she scrolled past them.
 - Participants wanted clearer calls to action on the updates
 - There was confusion around the 'Go to recent updates' link - many participants assumed this would take them to a full overview page, not the specific claim or message etc.
 - There was consistent confusion around the appointments update verbiage and information included (multiple participants mentioned they would need to know where the appoint was and what it was for)
 - One veteran was confused by the updates all together and didn't know what they were referring to - he preferred them to not be on the page at all.
 - Almost all participants mentioned that they would like to be able to prioritize their updates and information.
 - Participants wanted a more specific call to action that links to additional updates

**Can people find what they're looking for on the dashboard?**
 - All users were easily able to find what they were looking for regardless of the prototype they were using.
 
**Does the placement of the disability rating make sense to users?**
 - Yes - there was no confusion around this

**In the claims and health care sections, do users understand what is being displayed? Is it enough information?**
 - Overall, users understood the healthcare section
 - There was confusion about the wording in the messages update, vs what was showing below
 - There was some confusion about 'upcoming appointment' and 'cancelled appointment' in the updates section
 
 **What information is important for them to see first?**
 - All participants mentioned that they would want to see anything that was time-sensitive and needed their attention first
 
**What information related to health care, claims and applications/benefits do users want to see?**
 - People didn't need to see all of details of their information on the page, they were okay to have it be on a separate page.

**Is any information missing on the dashboard?**
 - Some specifics about appointments (will outline later)
 - Many participants mentioned they want to be able to track their prescription packages
 
**Do users expect to see more information on a desktop view?**
 - We didn't answer this question in this study

**How do people think the new dashboard compares to the current MyVA?**
 - Participants overall had a very positive response to the page
 - Most participants didn't have very specific memories of MyVA, so it is difficult to directly compare

**What updates are most important to users?**
 - Anything that is time-sensitive and need their attention

**Do people want to see all of their most recent updates?**
 - Not necessarily.  People were more interested in knowing if there was anything urgent or if there was anything coming up (aka appointments).  The status changes did not seem to interest people as much.

### A Design specific questions

**Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?**
**Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?**
**Do users want to see updates grouped all together?**

### B Design specific questions
**Does the dashboard layout/structure feel intuitive?**
**Do people understand what the updates to their dashboard are?**
**Do users want to see updates in each specific section?**
**Can people easily find what they are looking for with information collapsed in accordions?**

## Hypotheses & Answers
**Version A will be more slightly more successful than version B. Version A has all of the status updates elevate to the top of the page, and we hypothesize it will have less of a cognitive load. Version A has a long scrolling page design so all information is readily accessed, instead of being buried. However, both designs will be of value to the veterans as far as having accesss to thier updates and other important health care and claims information.**
 - False.  Users preferred whatever prototype they saw first.
 
 **Overall users will be able to see and understand the update section**
 - True.  All users understood the updates section. Except for the link to 'Go to recent updates' - most users were confused by this.
 
 **People will want to see more detailed personalized information than what is shown (i.e. upcoming appointments)**
 - False. People were fine with seeing less information as long as they could access all of the details on a different page.

**The new myVA dashboard layout will overall be intuitive and scan-able**
 - True.  All users were easily able to find and navigate both prototypes.
