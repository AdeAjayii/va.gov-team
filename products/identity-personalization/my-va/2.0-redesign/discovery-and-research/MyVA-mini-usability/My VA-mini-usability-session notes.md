# My VA Usability Participant Notes (Internal)

## (P1) - 5.14.2021, 2 ET

**IS enrolled in health care - but hardly ever uses it**

**Easily understood:**

- how to schedule/view all appointments
- how many secure messages he had
- how to get to other secure messages
- refill/track prescriptions
- how to finish and submit an application
- What the page was for

**Didn't understand:**

N/A - he easily understood everything on the page

**Things of note:**

- He did mention a 'dashboard', and thought that was a separate page that would go into more detail.

**Appointments**
- Either wanted to see the next 3 months, or always see upcoming appointments 

**Quotes:**
- "I want to see anything that I have upcoming." (this goes along with the idea of elevating action items.)
- "This seems like a good jumping off point, and it seems really useful.'
