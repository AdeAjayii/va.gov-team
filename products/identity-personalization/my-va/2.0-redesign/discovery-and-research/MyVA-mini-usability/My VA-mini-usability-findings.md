## Overview

We're in the final stages of build for the new My VA dashboard on va.gov. Since we were using prototypes for previous usability studies, we were unable to test with real data. We conducted this internal study using real data on production to help us understand a few things listed below.

1. Does our solution present any usability hurdles?
2. Does the overall layout we are launching with make sense to users?
3. How can we better elevate action items on a user dashboard?

We ran 6 moderated sessions on Zoom with internal colleagues who are also Veterans.
- No users had claims
- 4 out of 6 users were enrolled in health care. 1 uses it often, 2 uses it periodically, and 1 hardly ever uses it. 

## Findings

1. Users easily understood how to use the page and what the page was for. 
2. Users were easily able to complete tasks.
3. Users who had a disability rating easily understood how to use it and thought it was useful on the page.
4. All users 
5. All users stated that they would expect to see notifications on this page.
  >"I want to see anything that I have upcoming."

6. Users who were enrolled in health care found My VA to be useful (even if they did not have any claims).
7. Users who were NOT enrolled in health care and had no claims, did not find the page to be especially useful. 


## Things to test in the future

- Do users want to see sections that have no updates for them? Is the 'no update' update important? (i.e. if all of a users claims are closed, is it important to them to see that they have no claims?)
