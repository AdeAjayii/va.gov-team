# Design Sync notes from 10.25.20
Following last meeting, we have narrowed down the approach to two primary options. Listed here as "Simplified" and "Detailed".
This document will discuss some of the changes to each option, the pros/cons, questions to be answered, and next steps.

### Simplified
Potentially change "you have 3 new updates" to "Your recent activity"

Potentially consolidate "Dashboard" and "Overview" into one heading "Dashboard"

If user has none of something (ex:healthcare related actions), instead of saying 0, we can say 
"You are not enrolled in healthcare" or "Enroll in healthcare".

If user has some of a section (ex: healthcare, they have 0 messages but 2 appointments), we can have CTAs that say "Send your doctor a message".

Will we rank subcategories by importance? Ex: # of actions
Ex: Within healthcare, if we have no messages, no appointments, but 1 prescription…do we move prescription to the top? 
- Ask Lauren Alexanderson (MyHealthyVet structure). 
- Investigate using some of the same UX icons. 

Ryan prefers this approach
- It will be great once we turn on notifications/other types of notifications
- Believes this will scale better

## Complication(s)
_Describe what’s changed and how it impacts your team._\
_Leverage techniques like 5 Why’s_ 

## Question(s)
_What’s the fundamental question you are going  to answer?_ 

## Answer(s)
_How will the problem be solved and what evidence do we have that it will._ 
_How will you know the problem is solved? What data will you look for?_



## Appendix
### Context

_You see a problem. Perhaps it’s a problem you face or it’s a problem that affects your team. Typically, you bring these topics up in retros or you raise them with leads or you try to solve them yourself._

_But, you don’t always see improvement._

_One reason is we only address surface-level problems. This may be because resources are easier to come by for “simpler” solutions. Another reason is that as our orgs (DEPO, VSA, Platform, etc.) scale, issues affect more than just you or your team._

_This takes time and energy implementing idea after idea. Not to mention, there are likely a lot of other problems the org must prioritize against, which makes convincing others an uphill climb._

_So, how do we make it easier to prioritize problems our teams face?_

_We need to write things down. We need to take the time to document our thoughts and describe our ideas before presenting a problem so that it’s easier to understand and prioritize. Our approach here is to follow the SCQA framework._

_When might you use the template?:_
- _Tackling large submission payloads and its impacts on the user experience_
- _Addressing accessibility across multiple teams_
- _Improving how your team intakes requests_
- _Decreasing the time it takes for content to be published on VA.gov_

### Example
_Note: Example is for illustrative purposes only. Please don’t plan vacations this way unless you really want to._

- _We visit a new city every summer…_
- _But recently, the size of our group’s gotten bigger…_
- _And it’s harder to find room/board that meets our needs…_
- _Not to mention expenses..._
- _How do we find a place to stay that has all of the amenities we want within our budget?_
- _Answer_
  - _We’re going to organize and categorize the places we might like to visit-
  - _We’re going to research housing on VRBO and Airbnb_
  - _We’re going to use Splitwise to manage expenses_
