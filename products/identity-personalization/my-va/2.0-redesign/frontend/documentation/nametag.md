# Nametag specs

## When to show the nametag

**Show**

**Do not show**

- If someone is LOA1.

## States
  
**State 1**  

- Include the total disability rating **if** someone has one.
- The disability rating should link to the [the disability rating tool](https://www.va.gov/disability/view-disability-rating/rating).
- The disability rating number we are showing is the **total disability rating** for a given veteran, which can be made up of one or more ratings. This integration already exists on VA.gov. For specifics on how to connect to that endpoint, please talk to the **eBenefits migration team**, who originally migrated this information over to VA.gov from eBenefits.
