# Analytics to track as part of initial My VA 2.0 redesign

## Tracking updates 

We need updated tracking on the following, per our [OKRs & KPIs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/README.md#measuring-success):

- Updated tracking for all links on the page 
  - We should talk with the analytics team on how we want to do this. A lot of interactions are the same, but the design is different. What does this mean for tracking? Should there be some way to track the difference between My VA 1.0 and My VA 2.0 links?
- Add tracking to My VA link in the unauth nav
  - Is there anyway to see the funnel of people that click this link and actually go through sign in to end up on the My VA dashboard?
- Tracking of how many clicks to the Verify your identity link for LOA1 users (do we care about this?)

To confirm:

- Given that the URL of the page is **not** changing, am I correct in assuming we don't need to do anything to continue to track how many logged-in users visit My VA?

## Dashboard creation

We need would like to see the following modules on our OKR & KPI dashboard once the analytics team has bandwidth to create it, per our [OKRs & KPIs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/README.md#measuring-success):

- How many logged in users visit My VA
- Top My VA interactions (clicks)
- Top searches initiated from My VA 
- Average Foresee score (note: we understand we can't get this in GA, so this would be if we eventually had a Domo dashboard)
- [Tracking on My VA link in unauth nav]
