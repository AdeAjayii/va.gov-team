# Education benefits discovery and research/analytics review
Tressa Furner, Authenticated Experience, October 21,2021

[Project Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/education)

## Background

As part of the redesign of My VA, one of the high priority sections for users that we did not tackle in MVP was education benefit information. People mentioned education info as high priority in our initial dashboard discovery in 2020, and again in later research sessions. This effort aims to determine what a baseline would be for education information on the My VA dashboard.

The DGIB team has approached our team with some ideas of what could be on the My VA dashboard in the education section, but we need to take a step back and understand a few things before we scope MVP for this work. 

## Questions

- What endpoints do we have?
- What is the user journey of a user with education benefits?
- When is a user comparing schools?
- What can we show from a technical perspective?
- GI Bill tool - analyticsâ€¦ how can we get it on the dashboard?
- Depending on what financial information we can show, should we push back an education section and just do a financial section?
- What information can we show around payments?
- What data do we have access to?
- When should we surface the data we have access to?
- What works currently?
- What triggers this section on the dashboard?

## Analytics review
