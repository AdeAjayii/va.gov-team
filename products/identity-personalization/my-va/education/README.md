## Overview

When Veterans log into VA.gov, [they expect to be met with an experience that reflects their personal circumstances at the VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-want-a-page-that-is-focused-on-current-information-specific-to-them-rather-than-generalized-information-for-all-veterans). In July 2021, we moved closer to this goal by launching the [redesigned version of the My VA dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign#readme). As part of this, we elevated information on disability, claims, health care, and applications in progress, but we left a few things out of the MVP to keep scope down. One of the high priority sections for users that we did not tackle was education benefit information. People mentioned education info as high priority in our [initial dashboard discovery in 2020](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#veterans-care-about-anything-they-have-in-flight-whether-that-is-education-or-other-benefits), and again in [later research sessions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important). This effort aims to determine what a baseline would be for education information on the My VA dashboard.

## Problem Statement

- As a person who receives education benefits, I want to see the status of my benefits when I log into VA.gov.

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes

- Users who see their status of their education benefits and links to important edu tasks will be able to complete education business more quickly.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- The information we show is ultimately not helpful because we don't have access to the right APIs, so people are still searching for info and tasks.

## Business outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- We are able to move edu customers more quickly to relevant info and tasks.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- The information we show is ultimately not helpful because we don't have access to the right APIs, so people are still searching for info and tasks.

## Measuring success

OKRs and KPIs TBD

## Solution approach

For discovery, we will:

- Talk to edu team about what they know to be important to edu users. We may show very little of it in MVP, but it'll be helpful in determining what's a useful baseline.
- Look through My VA research to see what edu-related info people have mentioned as important.
- Look at analytics for top edu tasks.
- Determine what triggers the education section. 

## Key deliverables
