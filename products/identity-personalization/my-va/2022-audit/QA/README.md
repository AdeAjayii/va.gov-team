# QA Plan for My VA Audit Improvements
Our team no longer has a dedicated QA support team member so for the near term, we will need to perform QA ourselves as a team. 

## Overview
For QA of the My VA Audit Improvements we will be performing QA manually using a spreadsheet to track test cases and findings.

We need to test across the operating systems and browsers outlined below. Team members listed indicate who is responsible for testing that browser/system combination.
