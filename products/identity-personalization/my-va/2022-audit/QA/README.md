# QA Plan for My VA Audit Improvements
For QA of the My VA Audit Improvements we will be performing QA manually using a spreadsheet to track test cases and findings.


## Overview of Devices, Operating Systems & Browser

We need to test all 35 test cases across the devices, operating systems, and browsers  outlined below. 

### General Version-coverage Strategy
- **Hardware:** cover 2nd-latest models [1 yr back from latest available]
- **Operating Systems:** Windows 2nd-latest; MacOS/iOS latest
- **Browsers:** all latest

## How We Will Test and Track
1. Use spreadsheet to document test cases, browser/os/device combos and pass/fail
2. Leverage browserstack for browser/os/device combos we don't have access to
3. For any findings, team member will fill in a row for each item in the table below. 
4. AJ will create the needed ticket(s) to resolve finding, mark it in the Findings table below, and link it in the spreadsheet where the corresponding failure occurred.

## Findings
|         | Test case No. | Finding | Operating System| Browser | Device | Reporter | Ticket(s)|
|---------|---------|-------|---------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| | | | |  | | | |
