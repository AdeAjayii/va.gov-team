## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding locations on the VA.gov website and the information you see on those location pages.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing you, instead we are testing the website to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be participating in two exercises today.** We'll walk through these together. 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

[Start recording to the Cloud]

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

1. Can you tell me a little about yourself? (if needed, ask about service history)
2. What device are you joining us on?
3. Do you currently, or have you ever, received any benefits from the VA?
4. Do you currently, or have you ever, filed a claim or appeal with the VA?
5. (if yes) How do you check for any updates or changes to your benefits?
6. How often do you go online to manage your benefits?

## First task: [CARD SORT]  - ?? minutes

Just a little bit of background before we start - we are working on building a central place for you to recieve any action items, updates or reminders on VA.gov. These could be anything related to health care, benefits or just general announcements. 

1. So let's imagine that this sort of page exits - a centralized place for any new updates, reminders or action items that you need to complete on VA.gov. What would you expect a page like this would be called?

- Okay, great. Let's go ahead and get started - **I'll start with sharing my screen.**  

[PULLS UP OPTIMAL SORT]

**[CARD SORT - ADDING CARDS]** 

On these cards that you can see here, we have a few potential action items that you might see on VA.gov. Go ahead and read through these. If you can think of any additional action items that you might want to see, let's go ahead an make cards for them. 

**[CARD SORT - SORTING]** 

So now that we have all of the potential action items that you'd like to see - let's sort these by priority. 

We'll make three columns: High, Medium, and Low priority. 

**Feel free to think out loud as you work through the exercise.**

[AFTER CARD SORT]

[QUESTIONS]

- Ok, looking at theses categories, do you feel like they work for you?
- Let's take a look at the high priority column - why did you put these updates in that column?
    - What makes an update 'High priority' to you? 
- Let's take a look at the low priority column - why did you put these updates in that column?
    - What makes an update 'Low priority' to you? 
- So if you could imagine a page with all of these updates, how could you tell which ones are high priority vs low priority? 
- Any additional thoughts or questions before we move on?

## Second task: [PROTOTYPE]  - ?? minutes

Great, let's move on. We're now going to take a look at a prototype. I'll share a link with you, and go ahead and pull that up and share your screen with me.

### Logistics: figure out how to share your screen - 5 minutes

- Confirm with the participant that they are using a mobile device with Zoom installed
- If not, backup plan - load VA.gov in a "mobile frame" - open VA.gov in Chrome. Hit Command+Alt+J.  Backup to backup - moderator shares screen.

Let's start by making sure you can figure out how to share your screen on Zoom.

**If they are on an iPhone**
* Tap ‘Share content’ (Green button at bottom middle of the screen) If you can’t see the zoom menu, tap anywhere on your screen once and it should appear.
* Tap on Screen
* Tap Zoom
* Tap start broadcast. After a count of 3, the entire device screen will be shared into the meeting
* Tap the red bar at the top of your screen when you are ready to end the share 
* IF THEY CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT
   * they can tap "share content" then tap "web URL" and just enter in VA.gov
* For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the Zoom documentation here https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing   

**If they are on Android**
* Tap "Share"
* Tap "Screen"
* Tap Zoom
* May give a "sensitive info" alert
* May ask you to give Zoom permission to display over other apps, toggle yes. The hit the back arrow . Then it might just share your screen.
* Tap "Start now" (maybe)
* For Android troubleshooting, try here: https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen

**Ask participant to be mindful of thinking outloud since you will not be able to see a mouse cursor go through the prototype**




## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
