## Research Goals

As an enhancement to the new My VA dashboard, our team is looking to give Veterans access to their recent action items in a centralized place. We aim to understand the best way to implement the new action items feature on VA.gov. This includes:
 
- How do users expect to find their action items? 
- How do users expect to take action on their action items?
- What action items do users expect to see?
- Do users expect their action items to be ordered in a certain way? If so, how?

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to share a high-fidelity prototype. Users were asked to join using their mobile devices (android, iphone and samsung) - but some joined via a laptop or an ipad.

### Who we talked to

- 8 Veterans
- Ages varied from 35-65 (exact demographics unknown)
- All 8 veterans were currently disabled (ranging from 10%-100%)
- 5 out of 8 veterans were currently enrolled and using health care through the VA
- All 8 veterans were currently receiving some type of benefit (retirement, health care, GI bill etc)
- 4 out of 8 veterans had cognitive considerations
- 8 out of 8 veterans managed their benefits online (using primarily MHV and ebenefits)

### Research questions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

**Overall questions**
- Did we correctly prioritize this page?
- Is this page useful? Does it have the information and actions it needs?
- Is there anything they expected to see on My VA that’s missing?
- What do people think My VA is?
- What do people think will happen if they click My VA? Does our flow meet expectations?

**My VA vs. the homepage**
- What would people use My VA for vs. what would people use the homepage for?
- If there was no homepage, what would a user need My VA to do that it’s not currently doing?

**Mobile questions**

*Note-these probably aren’t questions we’d ask outright, but more assess by behavior*

- Can people find what they need on mobile?
- Does the page feel too long/like there is too much scrolling required to get to the information they need?

**Nametag**
- What identifiers do people expect to see on this page?
- Can people find their disability rating? Did they notice it in the name tag?

**Profile**
- Where do users think the profile link goes?
- What do they think is the difference is between the profile vs. My VA?

**Claims**
- Do they understand the featured claim is the most recently-updated claim?
- Do they know how many claims and appeals they have total? Is this information helpful to them?
- Do they know how to view the featured claim/all claims?
- Is there information missing — or are there actions missing — from this section?
- What do people expect to happen if they have no claims in progress?

**Health care**
- Did we correctly prioritize information in this section by featuring latest/most recent information? Or, are the CTAs into the tools and update totals more important?
- Can they find “totals” information (i.e. 2 unread messages)? And does this information matter to them?
- Do people understand the latest message (or upcoming appointment or most recent refill) is part of “2 unread messages” (or whatever total) or do they think it’s the latest message + 2 more unread messages (or whatever total)?
- Do people understand they are looking at their most recent prescription refill update? Why do they think they are seeing this prescription vs. another prescription?
- Do people understand how they can get more information about their messages/appointments/prescriptions?
- Do people understand the CTAs will not take them directly to the latest or most recent information? Do they understand CTAs will take them to an overview page?
- Are there other links, CTAs, or information that would be helpful to show in this section?

**Apply for benefits**
- Do people understand that they are looking at applications that they’ve started but not yet submitted? Do they understand what “in progress” means?
- Do people understand how to view an in-progress application?
- Do people understand why we are showing certain benefits in “benefits you might be interested in”?
- Do people think “benefits you might be interested in” are the ONLY benefits they are eligible for?
- Do people understand how to get more information on what benefits the VA offers? Is the information provided helpful to them?

## Overall Findings: What worked

**1. Users easily found the information that they were looking for and completed tasks. Overall, the information we have on My VA seems helpful.** Users were able to complete most tasks, even if there was some confusion about specific information (prescriptions, totals and grey boxes). Overall, users had positive feedback about the My VA page and stated that they would use it.

> "I like it, I have a similar one for work because I work in finance so it can pinpoint what needs actions, pending or in progress, so it is a one stop shop."

**2. All users stated that My VA met or exceeded their expectations.**  The information presented on the page was what they expected and they could easily find what they were looking for. Since we are using a prototype with dummy information, this may be skewed and we may get more valuable data in coming sessions using real information.

> "I like it, I think it is good. I like that it is phone friendly, they aren’t just information all over the page and you don’t need to scroll through a lot. The UI is designed in a way that is friendly to your eyes and other app developers do their pages. It's not just a spreadsheet that is all on the page. Summary of everything but not crazy extensive."

**3. There was a tie on preferring the homepage to My VA (4 to 4), but many participants mentioned how much they appreciated the personalization of My VA.** Users who preferred the homepage said they appreciated how much you could do on the page. Users who preferred My VA said they loved how streamlined and personal it was - but both users said they appreciated the personalization of My VA. Some folks said that there would need to be some additions to My VA for it to work as a homepage for them, specifically adding an education benefits and/or records section. This further validates the existence of My VA and our pursuit of personalization on VA.gov. 

> "I think it covers any questions or guide the veteran where to go if they have any questions. I don’t think they could leave this without finding an answer."

**4. People generally understood the difference between the My VA dashboard and the Profile, and they were able to accurately describe the profile in their own words.** However, they had a leg up because we asked them this question when they had already spent time on My VA. We should continue to explore this differentiation over time so we can make sure we're surfacing the right information in the right places.

**5. All users easily found and understood the disability rating and how to get more information on their disability ratings.**

> "Oh, my disability rating is just right up top - I love that!"

**6. Users found the grey boxes in appointments and claims & appeals to be useful.** Users easily understood that the grey box in claims & appeals was their latest claim update. There were some additional things that users would like to see in the appointments box (e.g. the doctor's name and type of practice), but they appreciated seeing their next appointment so they could keep track of it. Also, soon we will have the functionality to link to a specific appointment which will make that box more actionable.

> (When asked about the grey box in appointments) "Make you aware of the next appointment so you don’t miss it. That’s the most important thing is the next one so you do not forget and it is a reminder. It is good they put it there." 

**7. Users easily understood the applications in progress section and how to complete and submit an application.** Users understood that this was an application that they had personall started and they all easily stated they would click on the 'continue application' button to complete the application.
