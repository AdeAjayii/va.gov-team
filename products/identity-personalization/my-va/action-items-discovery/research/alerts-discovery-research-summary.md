## Research Goals

As an enhancement to the new My VA dashboard, our team is looking to give Veterans access to their recent action items in a centralized place. We aim to understand the best way to implement the new action items feature on VA.gov. This includes:
 
- How do users expect to find their action items? 
- How do users expect to take action on their action items?
- What action items do users expect to see?
- Do users expect their action items to be ordered in a certain way? If so, how?

## Research Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to share a high-fidelity prototype. Users were asked to join using their mobile devices (android, iphone and samsung). All uses joined on their mobile phones.

### Who we talked to

- 8 total Veterans
- Ages varied from 35-65 (exact demographics unknown)
- 7 out of 8 veterans were currently receiving disability compensation
- 7 out of 8 veterans were enrolled in and using VA health care
- 7 out of 8 veterans had an active appeal
- All 8 veterans were currently receiving some type of benefit (retirement, health care, GI bill etc)
- 2 out of 8 veterans had cognitive considerations
- 8 out of 8 veterans managed their benefits online (using primarily MHV and ebenefits)
- 6 out of 8 visited VA.gov specifically to check their benefits

## Research questions

- What are the most important scenarios that need action for users?
- What are the least important action items for users?
- How do people expect to see these action items?
- How do people expect their action items to be ordered?
- How do users expect to be able to resolve these action items?
- Do people expect to go to My VA to see notifications?
- Is it useful to have alerts on My VA?
- Is duplication helpful? (indicator + actual notification)
- How do users think of action items? (eg a to-do list or more of a notification?)
- What does a 'new' alert mean? (eg when should they see an indicator in the navigation)
- Do users want to see all the alerts theyâ€™ve ever had?
- What should this section be called?? (alerts, notifications, action items??)
- How do people know if a task is complete?
- What information about an action item do people need to see?

## Overall Findings: What worked

**Overall, users were very positive about the My VA and Alerts page. 8 out of 8 participants said they would use these pages and would find them very useful.**

### Alerts

**1. All users were quickly and easily able to find and understand the 'Alerts' link and indicator (red dot) in the navigation.** Users understood that the red dot meant that something needed their attention and they easily understood that they could get more information if they clicked on the link. All users were able to navigate to the alerts page with no problem.

> "Quote"

**2. Users easily understood the purpose of the alerts page and why they were seeing the alerts they were seeing.** Users understood the layout and content of the page, and were easily able to talk to personal experiences where certain alerts would be helpful. 

**3. Users were able to easily understand the amount of information shown in an alert and how to take action on said alert (eg clicking on links inside of alerts).** Many users appreciated the level of information shown. All users understood how to get additional information if they wanted it. There was some specific details (link) that users mentioned would be helpful if they were included (e.g. subject in messages), but overall the amount of information shown seemed appropriate. 

**4. All users mentioned redundancy as a welcomed and important feature.** All participants mentioned that they currently receive texts and emails from the VA, and having another channel of communication would not be a bad thing. Users also mentioned that they would NOT be confused if they recieved a text about a benefit update, and then came to VA.gov and saw the exact same alert on the website. In fact, they said it would work great for them. Many users mentioned push notifications as something that would be helpful.

**5. Users want their alerts to be ordered chronologically.** 

**6.All users easily understood and liked the term 'Alerts' after they saw it.** We asked users to pick a title before they saw the prototype and there was a large array of what people mentioned. *Just a thought - if we call the page 'Notifications', it might be confusing to a user to go to notification settings and not be able to change anything about the actual 'Notifications' page.*

#### What users thought this page should be called

*Note: some users mentioned multiple titles

- Notifications (3)
- Action items (2)
- Alerts (1)
- Knowledge base (1)
- Status updates (1)
- Benefit summary (1)
- VA notices (1)

### Alerts on My VA

**Users expect an alerts section to be on My VA, in addition to a separate alerts page.** Many participants were excited to see My VA, and mentioned that it would make tracking benefits easier. All users understood the difference between My VA and the Alerts page. 

### Prioritization

**Users don't expect the VA to know specifically what alerts are important to them.** Many users gave the sentiment that it depends on what is happening in a Veterans life, so a certain alert could be much more important at a certain time. Many participants gave the example of if they had a major health problem, then their appointment or messages alerts would be the most important, but if they had been waiting for their appeal hearing then that would become the most important. 



## Overall Findings: What did NOT work

### Alerts

**Most users want to be able to visually differentiate between old and new alerts. 4 out 8 participants expected anything that is time-sensitive and expired to 'disappear' all together (e.g. an appointment that has passed).** When asked what the difference was between 'old' and 'new', many users mentioned that an old alert would be something that they have taken action on - like a form that wasn't completed, but now is OR if an appointment has already passed. 2 participants wanted the ability to dismiss alerts themselves.  When asked to choose what they thought were the most important the two most commonly mentioned thing were the appeal hearing alert and form submission alert, followed closely by appointments. Many users mentioned knowing that their prescription had shipped was NOT important.

**5 out of 8 users wanted alerts to be sorted into categories (like on the homepage or on My VA). This included the ability to filter alerts by category or date. 3 out of 8 mentioned wanting the ability to customize what alerts they see.** 

> "Quote"

**There was some concern about alerts getting 'lost'. Some users felt overwhelmed with the number of alerts shown.** 

### My VA

**Users were very confused about why they were seeing those specific alerts on My VA** Most users thought that the alerts shown on My VA were there because they were more important than the other alerts. 

**7 out of 8 users missed the 'View all alerts' link completely. Many users mentioned wanting it to be further up on the page and called out.** 

### Prioritization

**Users generally wanted to be able to tell the difference between an 'action item' (something that the Veteran needs to DO) and a 'notification' (something that the Veteran should know).**

**All users mentioned time-sensitivity as an important indicator of what is 'important'.** 


## Things Veterans mentioned they'd want to see as an alert (in no specific order)

- Benefits that Veterans are entitled to
- Education payments
- Debt payments
- Timeline on appeals
- Home loan information (lenders, local APRs, loan status)
- Appointments
- Prescriptions
- Messages
- Claims and appeals information
- Physician referral approvals
- Annual amount of disability compensation
- Veteran organizations available to join
- Updates from the VA
- Covid-19 updates

## Additional findings

- Users expected the messaging link to take them directly to that specific messages, not the messaging page on MHV.
- 6 out of 8 users mentioned wanting to see the My VA page first thing when they log in.
- All participants had very postive feedback for the nametag area. 
- Many participants were surprised and excited at the level of personalization that was provided on the alerts page (even though it was a prototype and not their real information). 


## Recommendations

1. Explore ways to 
2. Keep totals for messages, but remove totals for appointments, claims and prescriptions. Replace with a 'Manage all X' CTA.   
3. Update CTA verbiage to be more actionable (i.e. Manage all prescriptions) in all sections.
4. Make the 'What benefits does the VA offer' dropdown more visible, or move to the top of section.
5. Eventually add in payment history and a notification hub when time/functionality allows.


## Next Steps

1. Make all updates to mobile and desktop prototype 
2. Make all updates on staging
3. Test again with real user information
