# My VA - Action Items: Discovery questions and research review

[Action Item Product Guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery/README.md)
  
## Questions we're trying to answer

In previous research for My VA/Logged-in homepage, users have mentioned wanting to be alerted on their dashboard of any time-sensitive action items that they need to complete. We need to explore the best way of doing this.  

To help us figure this out, we'd like to better understand:

- What are the action items that people expect to see?
- What action items can we show people?
- What are the most important action items for users?
- What are the least important action items for users?
- How do people expect to see these action items?
  - How do people expect their action itemts to be ordered?
  - Do people expect to see action items in sections or in an 'action item hub'?
- How do users expect to be able to resolve these action items?
- Will people come to My VA to see their notifications? 

## Past research

- [Notification research (2018)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Notifications/HCA%20MVP/Research/User%20Notifications%20Readout%20-%20end%20of%20sprint%20demo.pptx)
- My VA research
  - [Original pre-launch usability testing (April 2018)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/research/April%202018%20usability/Personalization%20MVP%20readout.pptx)

## Questions I have

- What 'action items' do we currently give Veterans?
- What 'action items' are actually useful to Veterans?
- How are we handling 'action items' elsewhere on the site? (if anywhere) Is the current approach on VA.gov working (if any)?
- What specific things in each section are important for users? 

## Potential Action items 

### Section breakdown

#### Disability Rating
- Status change to disability rating
- Any appointments related to disability rating (can we determine if an appointment is for this?)

#### Claims
- Status change
- VA needs additional information for claim/appeals

#### Health care
- Clinical updates (flu shot reminders etc)
- Appointment check in
- Prescription refills
- New messages
- New test results
- Any status changes to health care

#### Benefits
- Status changes
- VA needs additional info on applcations
- Eligibility (not possible from a technical standpoint)
- Dependent benefits changes

#### Payment/Financial (future feature)
- Status changes
- VA owes user
- User owes VA

## Next steps

- Audit of va.gov and how they are currently doing on-page notifications (if this exists anywhere)
- Collab with other teams working on notifications/action items (health care & debt resolutions)
- Comparative analysis
- Rough sketches
