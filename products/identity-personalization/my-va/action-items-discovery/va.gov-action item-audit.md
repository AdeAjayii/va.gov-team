# My VA action items: VA.gov audit
Tressa Furner, Authenticated Experience, May 2021

## Findings

1. In my research I haven't found any on-page notifications or anything that is the exact use case that we are looking to implement on My VA. There could potentially be some design cues from some of the health care work - but the fundamental use is different. 

## Debt Resolution - 'Next steps'

The debt resolution team briefly worked on including a 'next steps' section in the debt cards. 

**Worked well:**
- Users responded well to the 'next steps'

**To improve:**
- Users missed the section often - there is nothing marking next steps as important
- Users wanted more specific information about next steps, like a date

## Health care - To do/Notifications

The health care team is working on helping Veterans with all the paperwork that comes with visiting VA doctors. They are working on creating a task list to help Veterans understand what needs to be done and by when. This is based of [gov.uk's tasklist](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/task-list-pages/).

Here is an article about how [gov.uk tested their task list.](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2017/04/04/weve-published-the-task-list-pattern/)
