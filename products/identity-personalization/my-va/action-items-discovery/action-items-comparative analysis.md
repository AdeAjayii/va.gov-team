## Background

In previous research for My VA/Logged-in homepage, users have mentioned wanting to be alerted on their dashboard of any time-sensitive action items that they need to complete. We need to explore the best way of doing this. 

This study focused primarily on sites in the banking and insurance industries since they serve as a good model for the VA.gov use case (manage benefits, claims, payments, transactions, view history, etc). We explored a couple of companies outside of these industries as well to make sure we have a firm understanding of how various sites handle action items.

Screenshots were solicited for sites of interest since accounts are required to view the authenticated experience. We primarily requested desktop views.

## Goals

This comparative analysis aimed to observe the following:

- What are the types of action items that people expect to see?
- How to sites display action items? Where do they live in relation to the rest of the content on the page (in navigation, in sections or in a 'hub')?
- How do sites let/help users resolve action items? Is there an action item log? 
- How do sites visually prioritize action items?
- How do sites determine what is an important action item to a user? 

## Sites reviewed

- [UK.gov to do checklist]()
- [State Farm]()



## Takeaways

This comparative analysis aimed to observe the following:

### What are the types of action items that people expect to see?

This was difficult to assess in just a comparative analysis since many of the sites we had ask other people to log in.  

### How to sites display action items? Where do they live in relation to the rest of the content on the page (in navigation, in sections or in a 'hub')?
### How do sites let/help users resolve action items? Is there an action item log? 
### How do sites visually prioritize action items?
### How do sites determine what is an important action item to a user?
