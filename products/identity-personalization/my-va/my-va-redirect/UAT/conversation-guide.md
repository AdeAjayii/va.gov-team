# Conversation Guide for My VA Redirect UAT
- [ ] Make sure dev team has turned on feature for user
- [ ] Post in #feedback-backchannel

## Intro - 2 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and I also have a notetaker here. We've added a new feature to improve Veterans access to relevant updates and we want to test to make sure it’s working properly in your account.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
* There are a couple additional members from the website team who would like to observe the session and hear your feedback live. Are you comfortable with them joining the session? No pressure either way.
	* *Let other observers into room and allow a short pause to say hello.* Ok, so here we have some other members from our website team - hi everyone. And for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, the would be great.
* **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your feedback helps us to figure out how we can improve the Veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
* **We will be able to see your real information today.** This may include some healthcare information and some claims information. During any of the tasks if you feel uncomfortable sharing your screen with any of your information on it, feel free to stop screensharing and start again when you feel comfortable.
* **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

* **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** I will stop the recording once you are logged into the site so we don't record your personal information. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
	* If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

* **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes

1. As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you have an account on VA.gov. Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, Login.gov or ID.me account?
	* If they do not know what that means, ask: Do you ever sign into any va websites, such as VA.gov or ebenefits, to access or apply for your benefits? (If yes: Can you talk me through how you do that?)

2. Do you know your username and password so you can log in for the session today?
	* If not: Are these readily accessible? Could get them?
	* If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, **end the session.**
	
3. Today we are going to observe you interacting with the new feature on your computer, and I’ll have you log in shortly.  Before we do that, I’d like to hear about a recent time you logged into VA.gov.  Can you tell me what prompted you to log in?

4. What else do you log into VA.gov to do?


5. Thanks for sharing that! It’ll be helpful to know that as we move forward. Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen with me at this time?
	* If no: Explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, **end the call.**

OK, please share your screen, and then we will get started.

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute
Before we go, I was wondering if you have any friends or family that might be interested in participating in future sessions? 

If yes - wonderful! It’s so helpful to have people participate in sessions like these. I’ll have our team send you a blurb you can pass along to them.
