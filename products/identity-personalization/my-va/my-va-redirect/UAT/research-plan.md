# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, My VA Redirect UAT, July 2022

## Background
To improve personalization and access to action items, we’re implementing a redirect so users are redirected to My VA when they log in from the homepage.  

If they log in from any other page, they will not be redirected from My VA.

See our [initiative brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/my-va-redirect/README.md) for more details.

### OCTO-DE Objectives 
This redirect will move us closer to fulfilling our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items and benefit status. This will provide more direct, personalized routes to Veterans’ most critical updates and tasks

### Veteran Journey
Since My VA contains action items and benefit status anytime after a Veteran has established benefits with VA, this work impacts the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from Starting Up and beyond.

## Research Goals	
1. Confirm that the redirect functions as expected.
2. Evaluate how the redirect does or doesn’t meet Veteran expectations.

### Research questions
- Does the functionality work as expected, for all login types and across devices?
- What do people want to do once they’ve landed on My VA?
- Are there any points of confusion?

### Hypothesis
- Veterans will be able to more quickly access what is most important to them since they can bypass the homepage.
- Veterans will not miss the homepage.
- The most common next step will be clicking on a link we surface in My VA.
- Veterans will use search if they can’t find what they’re looking for on My VA.


## Method	
We'll have participants go through a list of specific tasks for UAT, and ask follow-up questions to get feedback on our usability related questions.

### Location
Remote, via Zoom

### Research materials
Conversation guide (link to come)

## Recruitment	
Our intended audience for this research is BIPOC Veterans who have payments and debt with VA. We'll use Perigean to recruit them.

We'll focus our recruitment criteria on the marginalized groups we didn't speak with during [our last usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings.md).

### Recruitment criteria

Please recruit 14 participants for 7 completed sessions.

#### Primary criteria (must-haves)

**All participants**
- must be LOA3 (identity verified) on VA.gov. **Participants will likely not know what this means, so please confirm this prior to testing.** 
	- This can be confirmed by having users sign into VA.gov with any of their credentials and having them go to the VA.gov profile. 
	- If they are prompted to verify their identity, that means they are LOA1 and they are not suitable for testing. 
	- If they can see any sections in profile **other than Account Security**, they are LOA3 and can participate in testing.

- Must be able to screenshare via Zoom.  Prior to the session, please confirm:
	- They're comfortable sharing their screen after they've logged into VA.gov.  Financial information will be viewable to the moderator and any observers.
	- They have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screenshare. 
	- **If they can not get Zoom working, there is no interview portion of this research and they will not be able to participate.**
	- **Qualifier:** Are you willing to share your screen with our moderator after you log in to VA.gov? The session will take you to a section of VA.gov where information about your benefits and any VA payments you receive will be visible. **Answer should be yes to qualify**

- Must be comfortable providing the email address they use to sign into VA.gov. We need this information 2-3 days before the study begins in order to give participants access to the redirect in production.

**Participant groups**
- 8 participants should be able to join the session from a device other than a laptop or desktop computer (tablets are OK)
- At least 6 participants should identify as other than male 
- At least 7 participants should identify as having a cognitive disability
- At least 6 participants should be older than 55
- At least 4 participants should use a screen reader.
	- **Qualifier:** Do you rely on a screen reader to navigate the internet and use a computer? **Answer should be yes to qualify.**

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
##### Inclusion:
- 4 people who use zoom magnification software
	- **Qualifier:** Do you use zoom magnification software, or zoom in more than 400% to read words on your screen? **Answer should be yes to qualify.**
- At least 6 Veterans who identify as Hispanic, Asian, or Native
- At least 2 Veterans with other than honorable discharge
* At least 4 Veterans who have an immigrant origin
* At least 8 Veterans who live in a rural environment
