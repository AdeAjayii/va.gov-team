## Introduction
This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

### Document goal
* To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
* To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
* To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

**Note:** Since this study is one component of [a larger research effort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/mhv-profile-research#project-outline-myhealthevetvagov-profile-transition-research), we won’t produce a findings document specifically for this round of user research. Rather, the findings most relevant to [overall research goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/mhv-profile-research#research-goals) will be incorporated into our final findings summary.

## Perceived Findings
### Our Hypothesis

**1. Veterans will be able to more quickly access what is most important to them since they can bypass the homepage.**
- Mostly false
- Most Veterans we spoke to primarily use VA digital services for health care (MHV) and wanted access to secure messaging and prescription refills, which were equally prominent to them on the homepage and My VA.
- A few participants commented that they liked being able to see their most recent payment information without having to click on anything

2. **Veterans will not miss the homepage.**
- Maybe true
- Most participants we spoke to were primarily interested in links that are also available on My VA
- Most participants we talk to usually go to eBenefits or MHV instead of VA.gov, so they have no current attachment to the homepage. Therefore, they won’t miss it
- About half of the participants prefer the layout to the homepage or the mobile app over My VA because it shows them all options “at a glance”, whereas they had to scroll much more on My VA. Those participants *prefer* the homepage, but we can’t say they will “miss” it.

3. **The most common next step will be clicking on a link we surface in My VA.**
 - Definitely true
 - Most participants would click on prescription refills or secure messaging

**4. Veterans will use search if they can’t find what they’re looking for on My VA.**
- Mostly true.
- This wasn’t specifically tested for the first half of participants. Those that we did ask, went to the main menu or search to look for a link that wasn’t there.

### Research questions
1. **Does the functionality work as expected, for all login types and across devices?**
- For the most part, yes.
- Of the 10 participants in our study, 4 experienced unexpected and inconsistent issues logging in.
- We observed successful redirects to My VA with ID.me, MHV, and DS Logon.
	- Need to review videos for Login.gov
- 2 of those 4 participants logged in with a MHV credential, which now routes people to ID.me for the 2FA portion of the login experience. After completing that, 1 user was routed to My VA, and one was not.
- The other 2 participants got errors on eauth.va.gov that the identity team is not sure what to make of.

2. **What do people want to do once they’ve landed on My VA?**
- Most participants wanted to click a link under health care.
- One participant felt like the page was “blank” and stated they’d go back to MHV to do what they needed to do, despite the fact that My VA had links to those same tasks on the page.
- One participant only logs into VA.gov to look for general news, VA updates, and went to the footer to try to find that information from My VA.

3. **Are there any points of confusion?**
- There weren’t any points of confusion caused by starting on the homepage, and landing on My VA once log in was completed.
- The most significant points of confusion we observed were related to the login process.  The redirects and 2FA process of logging in are disruptive enough that participants are grateful to just be done with that by the time they get to My VA.
- One participant, who had health care but no upcoming appointments, felt unsure after landing on My VA. 
> It’s kind of a weird screen….it’s got nothing on it. I’d have to chase it around [scroll] to get to where I need to go.


### Additional findings
1. **Participants had a hard time figuring out how to go back to the homepage from My VA**
- We had to skip this task for 1 participant
- Of 9 people we asked: 
	- 2 knew to click the logo to get back to the home page
	- 3 tried to use their browser back button, which triggered an error screen on a URL related to logging in
	- 2 looked for something called “home” in the main navigation menus
	- 2 had no idea how to get there

2. **Some participants preferred the homepage or the mobile app to My VA**
- These participants quickly scanned the headings in the 4 quadrants to get a sense of what they could find on the page
- 2 participants mentioned the load time of My VA being a drawback when compared to the homepage
- 3 participants mentioned the ease of logging in with biometrics as a benefit to the VA Mobile app over the homepage or My VA
> I just like one stop shopping. I’d rather see everything I might need in one place - Participant elaborating on their preference for the homepage over My VA

3. **Participants mentioned a few tasks that are important to them that aren’t on My VA**
- Viewing lab and test results
- Downloading their VA benefit letters
- Accessing their DD214
- 2 participants mentioned regularly checking on an appeal status that has been at a standstill for 2 years. When they logged in to My VA, they were shown the message that they had no claim updates within the last 30 days, which isn’t doesn’t help them complete their weekly task of seeing what the status is of their appeal. It would be better to show them the card that showed the status, despite it not having changed within the last 30 days.

4. **All participants we asked responded positively to the new observer method we piloted**
- We had time to ask 8 of 10 participants
- All 8 participants said they were fine with observers in the session
- 6 of the 8 shared positive feedback about being asked for consent
	- A few said it was very important to them to be asked
	- One shared that they have cognitive considerations and even if they gave consent when signing up for the survey, they might feel totally different the day of the session.
- 6 of 8 said having observers say a quick hello made them feel more welcome
	- One participant commented that it was odd that one observer decided not to say hello or turn on their camera.
