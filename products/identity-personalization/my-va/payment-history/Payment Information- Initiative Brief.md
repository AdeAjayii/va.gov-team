# My VA - Payment Information section - Initiative Brief 

## Outcome Summary
>Throughout [My VA 2.0 research and discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research)
 in 2020 - 2021, the recurring theme mentioned by veterans is that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority.  The importance of payment information is also reflected in analytics, as viewing payments is a top interaction on VA.gov overall and is a top search term from the My VA dashboard.  
This effort aims to add payment information to the My VA dashboard to be elevated for logged-in veteran's awareness and attention.

## Problem
> *The pain point to resolve is that veterans expect to have their personalized financial information available on the My VA dashboard, without having to search VA.gov for it.* 
- *What is the problem and who is affected?*
     * Logged-in veterans have to perform a search or access the homepage to find links to their compensation and/or debt information
- *And, what evidence do we have of the problem?* 
     * The terms “payment”, “debt”, “travel pay” and “direct deposit” (and variations of those terms) make up half of the top 20 search terms generated from My VA 
     * The same terms make up 4 of the top 20 search terms on VA.gov overall
- *Why do you think the problem is occurring?*
     * Once veterans log in to My VA, there is no quick, intuitive way to easily view their payments, debts and perform financial actions 
- *Other reasons why this might be occurring?* 
     * Veterans may have difficulty finding the appropriate links to access their financial information
- *How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?*
    * Increase the usage of My VA to become a one-stop shop for users’ benefit-related action items and status
    * Become a place where users can complete quick tasks related to their benefits

## User Outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes
- *Why would a user want to use this?*
    * This additional section will further support My VA dashboard as a "one-stop shop" for information that is a priority to veterans
    * Actionable links will allow the veteran to access more financial details and perform appropriate actions as needed
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
    * With this problem solved, Veterans will more quickly view their payment and debt information, instead of having to perform searches on the site
    * With this problem solved, Veterans will more easily be able to access payment history or view outstanding debts, which may result in quicker task completion
    * With this problem solved, Veterans may be able to more fully engage with the VA

### Undesired User Outcomes
- We do not want this section to cause confusion or add to their cognitive load.  It should be informative and usable
- We do not want the My VA page to become too cluttered or cumbersome, slowing down veterans, instead of expediting their experience
 
## Business Outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
    * The addition of a payment information section should help fulfill our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items and benefit status, so that it provides more direct, personalized routes to veterans’ most critical updates and tasks

- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
    * Provide veterans with a personalized go-to source for payment and debt information
    * Provide veterans with links to related action items, such as viewing outstanding debts, payment history, direct deposit or travel reimbursement
    * Reduce the number of payment or debt related searches


### Undesired Business Outcomes
- We do not want the My VA page to become cumbersome and unusable
- We do not want the payment information section to display irrelevant or incorrect information

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks.*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - Risk: Accuracy of the financial information displayed.  If incorrect information is displayed, it can damage the trust between the veteran and VA.gov. 
    - This can be mitigated by connecting directly to the payment/debt backend DBs to pull the correct data
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Risk: Potential confusion on where the links may direct the veteran
  - Risk: Potential confusion or degrading user experience when links direct to a page outside of My VA
    - This section will function the same as other sections already existing on My VA for a consistent experience.
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Risk: Dependency on payment and debt database availability
    - Payment and debt information is currently available within VA.gov, and can easily be accessed by My VA for display 
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - A constraint to consider is to complete full testing of the new section, with a phased production release while measuring against OKR/KPIs. Only successful results will trigger the next roll-out phase.

### Prioritization
> *Describe how the team will consider competing solution hypotheses/ideas. Prioritize them accounting for reach, impact/value, effort, and confidence.*
  - There is a question on whether we should display specific details on the last payment amount made to the veteran OR specific details on the outstanding debt.  
    - We will be conducting usability testing to determine the most effective and useful information to display to veterans.
  - Our research shows that direct deposit management and travel reimbursement are other top financial related searches, and we intend to include a link to manage each of them.  

### Solution Summary
> *What's in scope for you to build with this initiative? Describe key features/flows. What have you explicitly decided to **not** include and why?*


**In Scope - MVP**
  - Most recent payment
  - Dynamic debt link ('You've got 2 outstanding debt payments)
  - Manage Direct deposit [link]
  - View all payments [link]
  - Request travel reimbursement [link]



**Not In Scope** 
  - Survivors pension
  - Survivors comp (DIC)
  - Caregiver program
  - VA Homeloans information
  - Co-pay details (future enhancement as data comes available)
