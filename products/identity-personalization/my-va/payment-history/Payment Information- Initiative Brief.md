#### Overview

## Outcome Summary
>Throughout My VA 2.0 research and discovery in 2020 - 2021, the recurring theme mentioned by veterans is that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority.  The importance of payment information is also reflected in analytics, as viewing payments is a top interaction on VA.gov overall and is a top search term from the My VA dashboard.  
This effort aims to add payment information to the My VA dashboard to be elevated as part of the MVP.

## Problem
> *The pain point to resolve is that veterans expect to have their financial information available on the My VA dashboard, without having to search VA.gov for it.* 
* What is the problem and who is affected?*
     * Logged-in veterans have to perform a search or access the homepage to find links to their compensation and/or debt information
* And, what evidence do we have of the problem? 
     * The terms “payment”, “debt”, “travel pay” and “direct deposit” (and variations of those terms) make up half of the top 20 search terms generated from My VA 
     * The same terms make up 4 of the top 20 search terms on VA.gov overall
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? 
     * Once veterans log in to My VA, there is no quick, intuitive way to easily view their payments, debts and perform financial actions 
* Other reasons why this might be occurring? 
     * Veterans may have difficulty finding the appropriate links to access their financial information
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?
     * Increase the usage of My VA, to become a one-stop shop for users’ benefit-related action items and status
    * Become a place where users can complete quick tasks related to their benefits

## Desired User Outcomes
- *Why would a user want to use this?*
    * This additional section will further support My VA dashboard as a "one-stop shop" for information that is a priority to veterans
    * Actionable links will allow the veteran to access more financial details and perform appropriate actions as needed
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
    * With this problem solved, Veterans will more easily be able to view their payment and debt information, instead of having to perform searches on the site
    * With this problem solved, Veterans will more easily be able to access payment history or view outstanding debts, which may result in quicker task completion
    * With this problem solved, Veterans may be able to more fully engage with the VA

## Undesired User Outcomes
- We do not want Veterans to feel that this page is another place they have to check or another place that may have duplicative information to other parts of the VA.gov site. We want this page to be informative, not cause confusion or add to their cognitive load
- Additionally, if the page becomes too cluttered or cumbersome, it may slow down veterans, instead of expediting their experience
 

## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
    * The addition of a payment information section should help fulfill our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items and benefit status,so that it provides more direct, personalized routes to Veterans’ most critical updates and tasks

- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
    * Provide veterans with a personalized go-to source for payment and debt information
    * Provide veterans with links to related action items, such as viewing outstanding debts, payment history, direct deposit or travel reimbursement
    * Reduce the number of payment or debt related searches


## Undesired Business Outcomes
- We do not want the My VA dashboard page to become cumbersome and unusable
- We do not want the payment information section to display irrelevant information

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks.*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - The risk is in the accuracy of the financial information displayed. This can be mitigated by connecting directly to the payment/debt backend DBs to pull the correct data.
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - Potential confusion on where the links may direct the veteran
  - Potential confusion or degrading user experience when links direct to a page outside of My VA
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Payment and debt information is readily available within VA.gov, and can easily be accessed by My VA.
    - Dependency on payment and debt database availability
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - This additional payment information section will provide a desired source of information for veterans logging in to My VA dashboard. A constraint to consider is to complete full testing of the new section, with a phased production release while measuring against KPIs. Only successful results will trigger the next roll-out phase.

### Prioritization
> *Describe how the team will consider competing solution hypotheses/ideas. Prioritize them accounting for reach, impact/value, effort, and confidence.*
  - There is a question on whether we should display the last payment amount made to the veteran, and a link to outstanding debts OR a debt amount due, with a link to the payment history.  We will be conducting usability testing to determine the most effective and useful information to display to veterans.
  - At this time, our research states that direct deposit management and travel reimbursement are the other top financial related searches, and we intend to include a link to manage each of them.  

### Solution Summary
> *What's in scope for you to build with this initiative? Describe key features/flows. What have you explicitly decided to **not** include and why?*


**In Scope - MVP**
  - Most recent payment
  - Manage Direct deposit [link]
  - View Payment History [link]
  - Request travel reimbursement [link]
  - Dynamic debt link ('You've got 2 outstanding debt payments)


**Not In Scope** 
  - Survivors pension
  - Survivors comp (DIC)
  - Caregiver program
  - VA Homeloans information
