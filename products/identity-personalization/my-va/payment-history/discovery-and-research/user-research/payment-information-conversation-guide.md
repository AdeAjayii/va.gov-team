### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Have link to prototype ready: [desktop](https://preview.uxpin.com/45251888896c8dd47ef62aa20d3a89a334726ac1#/pages/145483168/simulate/no-panels?mode=i) and [mobile](https://preview.uxpin.com/45251888896c8dd47ef62aa20d3a89a334726ac1#/pages/145483175/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about a new feature we're adding to VA.gov to help Veterans get the most recent information about VA payments and debts.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. As you go through the prototype, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - X minutes

**Task goal: Confirm they qualify for the study, learn how they receive information from VA about financial things, and how that's meeting their needs.**

Before we look at the website, I'd like to get a little background information from you:

1. As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you had either received payments from VA or incurred education, compensation or pension debt. Can you tell me how you got info from VA about updates on those payments or debts?

2. What kind of information about your payments and debts did you get? Was that helpful? Was anything missing?

3. How do you manage your VA finances? Online, by mail, etc?

4. Let's talk about the website - how do you use VA.gov?

5. Tell me what you know about My VA.

    

## First Task: Wayfinding for payment information -  3 minutes

**Task goal: Make sure payment and debt information is findable, and learn about what kind of information participants would look for.**

Now I'm going to send you a link to the website, and have you share your screen. I'd like for you to show me how you'd go about finding new information about your payments and debts. 

As I mentioned earlier, it'll be very helpful for you to think out loud and share what's on your mind as much as possible.

- Send link to va.gov via chat
- Ask participant to share their screen

*If needed, ask:* 

- What kind of information are you looking for?
- What is most important information for you to know about this?

### Things to watch for:

- Where does the participant expect to find new information about payments and debts?
- What kind of information does the participant look for?
- What's most important for them to know?

## Second Task: Review My VA and financial info- X minutes

**Task goal: Validate we have included the right content and links, the structure of the page makes sense, and users can take sufficient action on their financial updates from My VA. We also want to learn about how the participant thinks about timing of finance related notifications**

*If not already on My VA:* 

- Thanks for showing that to me. Now I'm going to send you a different link, to a prototype of My VA.  

  **Note: may have the login to staging instead of we can test in code, and walk them through that if needed.**

- Have link to prototype ready: [desktop](https://preview.uxpin.com/45251888896c8dd47ef62aa20d3a89a334726ac1#/pages/145483168/simulate/no-panels?mode=i) and [mobile](https://preview.uxpin.com/45251888896c8dd47ef62aa20d3a89a334726ac1#/pages/145483175/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)

- Take a look at this page, and before you click on anything, tell me about what you see here. 
- *If needed:* 
  - What do you think is this page for?
  - What stands out to you on this page?
- Imagining that this was your personalized page, talk to me about how this lines up with information that is important to you. 
  - *If needed:* 
    - How would you rank the sections you see here, in order of importance to you?
    - Let's focus on the payment section. Talk to me about the information you see there.
    - What would you do from here?
    - Is anything missing?
- I'm interested in your thoughts about timing for financial information. 
  - How long after a payment is made to you or a debt is added do you need to see that information?
  - Let me give you an example - say you used your education benefits ago and the last payment you received was in January 2021. Would you still want to see that?
- One more specific thing I want your feedback on - do you have any experience with VA travel reimbursement? Show me where you'd look for that on this page. 
  - What are your thoughts on it being there?

### Things to watch for:

- What information does the participant mention as being important to them?
- Do the alerts stand out to the participant? 
- Do they mention anything about alerts being on top and mixed into sections of the page?
- Is the link sufficient for participants to take action from the payment section?
- What does the participant think about timing for fiancial information?
- Where does the participant expect to see travel reimbursement info?

## Third Task: Review onsite notifications - X minutes

**Task goal: Validate that the design of the onsite notification is effective and does not present any usability hurdles, learn how participants would want to interact with the alert, and understand user expectations around onsite notifications.**

Now let's look specifically at the call-outs (yellow notifications) on the page. Tell me your thoughts on those.

*If needed*:

- What are your thoughts on how they're placed within the page?
- Is that information important enough to you that it should be highlighted like that?

Let's talk about any interactivity you notice related to these alerts. What can you do with them?

*If needed:*

- Why would you want to dismiss the alert?
- What do you expect happen after you dismiss it? 
- How would you find that information again?
- Why do you think some are dismissible and some are not?

And for this specific notification - a new debt has been added - at what point would you expect to see that information?

In general, if you have a new notification on VA.gov, how would you know about it? 

### Things to watch for:

- Did the participant notice the alerts on the page without being directed to them?
- How does the participant feel about having call outs both at the top of the page and within sections?
- What are the participants reasons for wanting to dismiss at alert?
- What are the participant's expectations around dismissing alerts and finding that information again?
- At what point does the participant expect to see new debt information?
- How does the participant expect to find out about new notifications on VA.gov?

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.
