This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.
*The goal of this document is:*
* To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
* To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
* To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings
### Proposed payment information IA
#### Participants intuitively found recent information about payments under View Payment History links on the homepage,  and on My VA. 
- All participants went to the view payment history link under the relevant benefit from the homepage
- X participants quickly verbalized noticing the payment information after landing on My VA.
#### Participants weren’t confident about where to find debt information from the homepage, but easily understood where to find that information on My VA
- Some participants guessed they might find debt information under payment history
- Most had no expectation about where to find debt information.
#### Participants easily found the payment information most important to them on My VA.
All participants stated that payment amount and date were most important information, and easily found that information on My VA.
#### People are comforted knowing they do not have outstanding debt.
4 participants mentioned wanting to see something on the page confirming their debt had been resolved, or simply that they did not have any outstanding debt.  One participant mentioned this as being important to them, even though they had never had debt with the VA.
> Even if I have a zero balance owed, it would be cool to be able to confirm that.

#### Remaining education benefit amount is an important data point to Veterans who have education benefits.
3 participants who had education benefits shared that it was not easy to figure out how much education benefit they had remaining, and that it would be useful to see that information on this page.

#### Participant expectations about where to find the travel reimbursement information were varied.
/need to confirm numbers; did not have time to ask 1 participant/
* X participants said benefit payments and debts
* X participants said health care
* X participants said claims & appeals
* X participants would use search

#### Participant’s preferred order of sections was based on their VA benefits and services. 
Each participant had different feedback about which section was most important to them and how they’d rank the My VA sections they saw. They stated the section that contained information about the benefit they used most was the most important, and many commented that the most important section to them would change over time.
> find quote from P14 about claims and appeals being important once upon a time.
For some participants it was health care, others it was benefit payment and debts, and others stated claims and appeals. One participant said Applying for benefits would be the most important.
#### Most users expected to see important information, such as an alert, at the top of the page, but were not bothered by having alerts in multiple places on the page.
> find quote about it being good to be reminded in more than one place

> find quote about it being helpful for people with STML especially on a mobile device where you have to scroll so much (P12? First mobile user)

### Financial information
#### Amount and date are the most important pieces of information for payments
> find supporting quote RE “how much and when”
#### Amount and reason were cited as the two most important pieces of information about debt, but participants would want more detailed information. 
None of the participants had debt (confirm), and many weren’t aware you could go into debt with VA. They spoke from the perspective of “/if/ they had debt” and stated they’d want to know how much, what it was for, how to pay it back, and as well as who to contact for assistance or to answer questions.
#### Participants had mixed feelings on whether or not they wanted to see the number of outstanding debts.
> quote about it being upsetting to see the number in your face

> quote about wanting to know exactly what was going on

#### Participants wanted to see confirmation that they had $0
> quote about expecting to see confirmation after paying a debt

> quote about int being comforting to know they were squared away with VA

#### Seeing the most recent payment on My VA was sufficient for participants, since the information is accompanied by the View Payment History link.
Most participants rely on information from their bank to get payment information, but thought it was helpful to see the last payment history. In particular, they felt it would be helpful for tax or record-keeping purposes.

Multiple people talked about wanting to see the last payment regardless of how far in the past it was.  The view payment history link was easy for them to notice and use, and would be sufficient to meet their needs for payment information.

#### The majority of participants easily used the View payment history and Manage your direct deposit links; the exception was a user using screen magnification software.
Almost all participants found the links to take action on their payments 

### Onsite notifications
#### Most participants thought having alerts scattered throughout the page was helpful; 2 preferred to see them all grouped together at the top.
Having alerts in multiple places on the page served as an effective reminder for participants. No one stated it was bothersome to see information repeated, and actually stated it was preferred to be reminded about debt because it was such an important topic to them.

> /insert quote from p12 or 13/

#### 2 participants wanted a heading above the alert section at the top of the page to provide additional context.

## Additional findings
### It was not particularly important to people who had been receiving consistent compensation payments to see payment information on My VA.
* They weren’t bothered by seeing it, but it isn’t something they check on or look at regularly.
* Multiple participants made comments that it would be important to them if they were living “day to day” or “check to check”
*
## Lessons about the recruiting process and participant pool
* Recruiting criteria seems to have been confusing somewhere along the way - we didn’t get any participants who actually had debt despite having indicated that they did to participate in the study.
* We got clarity 1/2 way through the study that we /can/ record PII, so some recordings have better notes/transcripts than others
* Needed to allow more time for sessions (should’ve been 45 minutes)
* Should’ve put max number of sessions
