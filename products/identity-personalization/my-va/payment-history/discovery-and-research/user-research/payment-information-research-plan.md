# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience team, Payment information, January 2022

`Draft`

## Background

Throughout [My VA 2.0 research and discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research) in 2020 - 2021, the recurring theme mentioned by Veterans is that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority. The importance of payment information is also reflected in analytics, as viewing payments is a top interaction on VA.gov overall and is a top search term from the My VA dashboard.

This effort aims to add payment information to the My VA dashboard to be elevated for logged-in Veteran's awareness and attention, as the MVP.

### OCTO Objectives 

The addition of a payment information section should help fulfill our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items and benefit status, so that it provides more direct, personalized routes to Veteransâ€™ most critical updates and tasks

### Veteran Journey

Since Veterans can incur debt any time after establishing benefits with VA, this work impacts the Veteran journey from Starting Up and beyond.

## Research Goals	

### 1. Validate that our proposed payment information IA matches the Veteran mental model.

- Where do users expect to see new information about their payments and debts on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)?
- Do users expect to see a travel reimbursement link under health care or payment information?
- What is the order of importance of the existing sections on My VA + payment information?
- Can users find the payment information that they're looking for?
- How do users expect their action items to be structured in relation to non-action item information? (in sections, or all at the top together, or something else?)

### 2. Understand the financial information that is most important to Veterans.

- What information do users want to know about new debts, existing debts, and payments from the VA?
- Are we missing any additional links?
- How long do users expect to have access to historical financial information (debts + payments) on My VA?
- Does providing a link allow users take sufficiently take action on their payments and debts, and manage direct deposit?

### **3. Validate that our onsite notification MVP meets Veterans' needs.**

- Is the proposed MVP solution helpful to Veterans?
- When does a user expect to see an alert about new debt?
- If a user has a new notification on VA.gov, how would they know?
- Why would a user want to dismiss this alert?
- What do users expect to happen after an alert has been dismissed?
- What other notifications do users expect to see on VA.gov?

### Outcome

We'll use the findings from this research to update our page IA and inform our MVP designs.

### Hypothesis

- We believe Veterans will find it useful to see information about recent payments and outstanding debts surfaced on My VA.
- We believe Veterans will want to see more details about the financial information, and that providing a link from My VA will be a sufficient way for them to get those details.
- We believe the design for action items and alerts will be effective at drawing attention to important information.
- We believe there may be some confusion about why some alerts are at the top of the page, and others are within distinct sections of My VA.

## Method	

We'll conduct remote usability testing over Zoom using a desktop prototype.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We will recruit Veteran participants using a lean maximum variation strategy.  We'll leverage Perigean's recruiting services to find our participants.

### Recruitment criteria

Schedule 10 Veterans for a minimum of 5 successfully completed sessions.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

- All participants should have previously been notified about payments received from the VA OR been notified about a VA-related debt (both are OK too). 
  - Example: Have you ever been notified about a payment you received from the VA?
  - Example: Have you ever been notified about a VA-related debt?
  - Answering yes to either or both questions would qualify the participant for the study.
- Please confirm participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screen share.

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline

If you are using Perigean to recruit please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote research, 2+ weeks for in person. 

### Prepare

When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 

* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions

What dates do you plan to do research? 

### Length of sessions

How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. 
Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

### Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 
Please request enough dates and time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.).
