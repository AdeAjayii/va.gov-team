# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience team, Payment information and onsite notifications, January 2022

## Background

Throughout [My VA 2.0 research and discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research) in 2020 - 2021, the recurring theme mentioned by Veterans is that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority. The importance of payment information is also reflected in analytics, as viewing payments is a top interaction on VA.gov overall and is a top search term from the My VA dashboard.

This effort aims to add payment information to the My VA dashboard to be elevated for logged-in Veteran's awareness and attention, as the MVP.

### OCTO Objectives 

The addition of a payment information section should help fulfill our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items and benefit status, so that it provides more direct, personalized routes to Veterans’ most critical updates and tasks

### Veteran Journey

Since Veterans can incur debt any time after establishing benefits with VA, this work impacts the Veteran journey from Starting Up and beyond.

## Research Goals	

### 1. Validate that our proposed payment information IA matches the Veteran mental model.

- Where do users expect to see new information about their payments and debts on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)?
- Do users expect to see a travel reimbursement link under health care or payment information?
- What is the order of importance of the existing sections on My VA + payment information?
- Can users find the payment information that they're looking for?
- How do users expect their action items to be structured in relation to non-action item information? (in sections, or all at the top together, or something else?)

### 2. Understand the financial information that is most important to Veterans.

- What information do users want to know about new debts, existing debts, and payments from the VA?
  - Is it important for them to know how many new debts have been added, or only that they have new debt?

- Are we missing any additional links?
- How long do users expect to have access to historical financial information (debts + payments) on My VA?
- Does providing a link allow users take sufficiently take action on their payments and debts, and manage direct deposit?

### **3. Validate that our onsite notification MVP meets Veterans' needs.**

- Does the proposed MVP solution (a single dismissible debt notification displayed at the top of the page) help Veterans to more easily take action on their payments or debts?
  - Why would a user want to dismiss this alert?
  - What do users expect to happen after an alert has been dismissed?
  - Are there any areas where the design does not meet Veteran needs?
- When does a user expect to see an alert about new debt?
- If a user has a new notification on VA.gov, how would they know?

### Outcome

We'll use the findings from this research to update our page IA and inform our MVP designs.

### Hypothesis

- We believe Veterans will find it useful to see information about recent payments and outstanding debts surfaced on My VA.
- We believe Veterans will want to see more details about the financial information, and that providing a link from My VA will be a sufficient way for them to get those details.
- We believe the design for action items and alerts will be effective at drawing attention to important information.
- We believe there may be some confusion about why some alerts are at the top of the page, and others are within distinct sections of My VA.

## Method	

We'll conduct remote usability testing over Zoom using a prototype.

### Research materials
