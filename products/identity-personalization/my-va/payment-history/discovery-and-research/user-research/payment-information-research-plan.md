# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience team, Payment information, January 2022

`Draft`

## Background

Throughout [My VA 2.0 research and discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research) in 2020 - 2021, the recurring theme mentioned by Veterans is that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority. The importance of payment information is also reflected in analytics, as viewing payments is a top interaction on VA.gov overall and is a top search term from the My VA dashboard.

This effort aims to add payment information to the My VA dashboard to be elevated for logged-in Veteran's awareness and attention, as the MVP.

### OCTO Objectives 

The addition of a payment information section should help fulfill our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items and benefit status, so that it provides more direct, personalized routes to Veterans’ most critical updates and tasks

### Veteran Journey

Since Veterans can incur debt any time after establishing benefits with VA, this work impacts the Veteran journey from Starting Up and beyond.

## Research Goals	

### 1. Validate that our proposed IA matches the Veteran mental model

- How do users expect to see that they've recieved a new payment on VA.gov?
- Where do users expect to see that they have a new debt on VA.gov?
- Where do users expect to see a link to 'Request travel reimbursement'?
- What is the order of importance of the existing sections on My VA + payment information?
- How does a user take action on an existing debt? 
- Can users find the information that they're looking for?
- Can users take action on their financial information? 
- How do users expect their action items to be structured in relation to non-action item information? (in sections or all at the top together or something else?)

### 2. Understand the financial information that is most important to Veterans.

- What is the most important information for users to see related to their payments from the VA?
- What information are users looking to see about their most recent deposit?
- Are we missing any additional links?
- How long does a user expect to see information about their payments recieved on My VA?
- How long does a user expect to see information about their debts on My VA?

### **3. Onsite Notifications**
- Where would users expect to see action items from the VA?
- Is it helpful to know that a new debt has been added?
- If a user has recieved a text or email about a new debt, does it make sense to also see it on My VA?
- When does a user expect to see an alert about new debt?
- What information do users want to know about a new debt?
- When would a user want to dismiss this alert?
- Why would a user want to dismiss this alert?
- What do users expect to happen after an alert has been dismissed?
- What other notifications do users expect to see on VA.gov?
- If a user has a new notification on VA.gov, how would they know?

### Outcome

We'll use the findings from this research to update our page IA and inform our MVP designs.

### Hypothesis

What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Method	

We'll conduct remote usability testing over Zoom.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:

- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. [Use the recruitment checker on Microsoft Excel teams](https://governmentcio.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/VSATeam/Shared%20Documents/Accessibility/RecruitmentChecker.xlsx?d=we0ffb06d5bac4cd5902c5f8b23fe988c&csf=1&web=1&e=FzYt5t) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity. *Note: if you are struggling to access the online teams link; you can also [use the recruitment checker on Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) and take a screenshot of your table to share.*

### Recruitment criteria

List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Pro tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline

If you are using Perigean to recruit please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote research, 2+ weeks for in person. 

### Prepare

When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 

* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions

What dates do you plan to do research? 

### Length of sessions

How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. 
Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

### Availability

When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 
Please request enough dates and time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.).
