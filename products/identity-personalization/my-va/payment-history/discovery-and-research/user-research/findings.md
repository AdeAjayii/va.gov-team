# Research Goals

*First, set the context of this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey. Explain what a Veteran might do before and after using this tool. What moments does this tool live in? Are there moments that matter to keep in mind? What are Veteran’s familiarity with tools like this? (do they use tools like this, or is this something new).* *[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)*

The purpose of this research was to:

1. Validate that our proposed payment information IA matches the Veteran mental model.
  
2. Understand the financial information that is most important to Veterans.
  What information do users want to know about new debts, existing debts, and payments from the VA?
  
3. Validate that our onsite notification MVP meets Veterans' needs.
  

# Research Questions

- Where do users expect to see new information about their payments and debts on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/)?
  
- Can users find the payment information that they're looking for?
  
- Do users expect to see a travel reimbursement link under health care or payment information?
  
- What is the order of importance of the existing sections on My VA + payment information?
  
- How do users expect their action items to be structured in relation to non-action item information?
  
- What information do users want to know about new debts, existing debts, and payments from the VA?
  
  - Is it important for them to know how many new debts have been added, or only that they have new debt?
- Are we missing any additional links?
  
- How long do users expect to have access to historical financial information (debts + payments) on My VA?
  
- Does providing a link allow users take sufficiently take action on their payments and debts, and manage direct deposit?
  
- Does the proposed MVP solution (a single dismissible debt notification displayed at the top of the page) help Veterans to more easily take action on their payments or debts?
  
  - Why would a user want to dismiss this alert?
  - What do users expect to happen after an alert has been dismissed? How and when would they see that information again?
  - Are there any areas where the design does not meet Veteran needs?
- When does a user expect to see an alert about new debt?
  

# Methodology

We conducted 30 minute remote moderated sessions via zoom on **January 12-14, 2022.** Participants were asked to log in and provide feedback on the Benefits Payments and Debts section of My VA, and onsite notifications on VA.gov.

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

- We believe Veterans will be able to more easily manage their debts and view payment history using the links in My VA.
  - TRUE/FALSE/MAYBE TRUE/MAYBE FALSE
- We believe Veterans will not need to use site search to find their payment or debt information from My VA.
- We believe Veterans will want to see more details about the financial information than we're surfacing on My VA, and that providing a link will be a sufficient way for them to get those details.
- We believe the design for action items and alerts will be effective at drawing attention to important information.
- We believe there may be some confusion about why some alerts are at the top of the page, and others are within distinct sections of My VA.
