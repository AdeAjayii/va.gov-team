#Â Pilot - My VA Payment and Onsite Notifications Research Notes

1/11/22

**M:** Can you tell me how you get info from the VA about your payments and debts?

**P:** I usually log into VA.gov and navigate to the disability claim section.

**M:** You mentioned you get disability payments. What information about your payments is helpful to you?

**P: **The amount, and when it is going to be deposited, or when it's due. Those are probably the most improtant pieces of information.

**M:** Do you proactively get info from VA about this, like notifications, emails or letters?

**P:** I do, I get letters through the mail whenever they've done a review or updated something wrt my disability payments. For example, one of my kids graudated hiigh school so I had to show proof that they're still in school to claim them as a dependent. So sometimes I get correspondence in the mail regarding my disability.

**M:** I also wanted to ask if you manage your VA finances online or by mail - it sounds like it's already online

**P:** Yeah

**M:** Do you use VA.gov in other ways?

**P:** Yeah, I used it to file a disability claim, I've perused it to see what's on there, like waht do they have for my medical finroation, home of record. I've actually used it to get inforomation about things like eduational benefits.

**M**: Ok Now I'll ask you to go to VA.gov and have you share your screen, and show me how you go about making your way to the disability section as we discussed.

**P:****** Let me log in.

Recording paused for PII reasons.

**M:** Tell me your thoughts on the call outs on the page?

**P:** The call-outs as in this? *Mouses over nametag*

**M:** Ah, no. The call-outs as in the alert.

**P:** Oh, well that didn't call out to me very loudly. So that's my first thought. It probably could be a little more promininent. I don't know maybe a different color or font, but this (nametag) calls out to me a lot more than this does. If the idea is to call out Hey, you have new debt, this is not very eye catching to me.

**M:** Do you think that that kind of information that you have new debt is important enough that it should be a more impactful call out than it is?

**P:** Yes, I do. Minly because I don't like to have outstanding debts, so I like to know right away that I Have new debt. Yes. It's important enough to call it out for sure. *Mouses over alert in health care* I do like this better here, as opposed to where it was. I don't use health care that often, but I like that it's called out here as opposed to the live environment where it's just a link

**M:** Can you speak more about why that works better for you?

**P:** It's more eye catching. It's definitely better called out than in a list like this. Especially if you want me to read those messages. In the other environment, I scrolled down and thought oh yeah, I had unread messages but it wasn't anything...you know. Thiis makes me want to read it. I have a question. *scrolls up to onsite notification* If I click on this, does that make it go away?

**M:** What would you think?

**P:** I would think that once I acknowledge it it would go away. Until I had some kind of new information added.

**M:** Say you didn't click from here, and you paid your debt, what would you expect to happen to this notification?

**P:** I would expect to not see this call out anymore.

**M:** If you scroll down to the benefit payment section, what would happen if you were to click your manage VA debt here.

**P:** I would expect it to take me to a page where I can number 1 view my debts, and perhaps drill iinto them to see where exactly where they caame from, what appts they're associated to or what have you, and I would expect to have a way to pay them online.

**M:** Ok, let's talk about any interactivity with these alerts. Did you notice any other kind of interactivity on any of them?

**P:** Not really. Just the links.

**M:** What about the one up at the top>

**P:** *scrolls up, hesitates* Again, when it says manage, to me that means you know, review, drill into, get details, and pay if you want to. I would expect it to take me toa. page where I can do all of those things.

**M:** did you notice the little X to the right of the alert

**P:** I did.

**M:** what would you expect to happen if you clicked on it?

**P:** *clicks* Exactly that. So if I don't want to see it anymore, I would close it. For me, I would expect not to see it anymore if I paid it, or if I closed it.

**M:** If you closed it, didn't pay your debt, and came back here, would you expect to see the lart?

**P:** Yeah, I would expect to see it until I paid my debt.

**M:** Why do you think some are dismissible and some arent?

**P:** *hesitates* That's a good question. I think they all should be dismissible. This one *mouses over health alert* should be dismissible, because I don't necessarily care.

**M:** Right, you said when you first log into the site you close all the alerts.

**P:** Yes, I close all the alerts because It's a lot, it's crowded. A lot of stuff pops up There's a header, and a footer. This one here *debt alert* I probably wouldn't want to be able to dismiss it in this particular position, because if tehre's still debt that needs to be managed, that call out needs to stay there until it's managed. That one should be dismissible because that's the call out. That's bam, in your face.

**M:** Those are all the specific things I wanted to get your feedback on. In general, what stands out to you about this page?

P: *scrolls down, mouses over benefit payments* This stands out to me. This is very cool. I would put it up higher, but I'm not a Veteran who uses this (health care). This is actually really cool too (appt card) if I did use VA health care, this would be cool. It's very cool.

M: Is there anything confusing about My VA?

P: I don't think so. I think it's a little out of order, I feel like benefit payments and debts should be with claims and appeals. It feels a little disjointed with health care in between. So either health care stuff up top, and all the money related things below, or vice versa. I wouldn't expect it to be split out. Other than that, I think it's very straightforward.

M: Is there anything missing on the page that you wish you could see?

P: No, I don't think so. It feels like you have all of your benefits in one spot.
