# Payment history/financial information Discovery (WIP)
Tressa Furner, Authenticated Experience, November 3, 2021

Research shows that users want all payment information in one spot - whether it's 'money in' or 'money out'

View payment history
(another one?)
Travel re-imbursement
Pay debts

**Benefit debt ('Manage your VA debt' tool)** 
- Check balance / status of debt(s) (they'll see statuses like 'we're reviewing your request' and 'your compromise offer was accepted'
- Pay debt (online through pay.va.gov, by phone, by mail)
- Request help with debt (online FSR form)
- Dispute debt (by email, askva, w/e... online form will be built eventually)

**Copay bills**
- Check balance for their facilities
- Pay bill (online through pay.gov, by phone, mail)
- Request help with debt (online FSR form soon)

**Payment history** ([Screenshot](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/images/View%20Payment%20History.png))
- Disability compensation
- Pension benefits
- Education benefits

**Other**
- Survivors pension
- Compensation for surviving spouse and dependents (DIC)
- VA Home loans (maybe this fits under debt)
- Payments caregivers receive through the caregiver program


**Thoughts/Question** 
- We need to reach out to the mobile app team about their card sort and what they found about finances


**Meeting with Debt Management team**

Mikki: Currently working on a content page to bring all of these tools together, it's broken up into what VA owes you + What You owe the VA. This is not currently launched, but it's being worked on.

Current IA:

Payment History tool
Manage Debt Portal

(The team has worked on a static content page to bring all of these pages together, but it maybe isn't the right approach)

Knowing the balance and then clicking into the tool directly would satisfy user needs
- The Balance (currently exists)
- When it is due (currently exists)
- Status is a potential thing that could change, and maybe would be included... does this need to live on My VA? Yes, some of them need an action that is not make a payment. (they are the blue boxes)

What currently exists on Debt Management Tool:
- Balance
- When it's due

What is being worked on (will be worked on soon, likely will be done in the early new year/maybe Q1) 
- Status
- Next Steps

Users will only have 1-3 of the debt cards. Where can they get debt from? 
- Comp & pen 
- Education (Post-911 Bill, Chap 33, Chap 35)

[ADD SCREENSHOTS] from becca/riley

This hasn't been research specifically, it's come from several different studies. 

Co-pays for health care things, we need to figure that out.
