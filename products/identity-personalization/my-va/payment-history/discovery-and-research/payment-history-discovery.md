# Payment history/financial information Discovery (WIP)
Tressa Furner, Authenticated Experience, November 3, 2021

Research shows that users want all payment information in one spot - whether it's 'money in' or 'money out'

**Benefit debt ('Manage your VA debt' tool)** 
- Check balance / status of debt(s) (they'll see statuses like 'we're reviewing your request' and 'your compromise offer was accepted'
- Pay debt (online through pay.va.gov, by phone, by mail)
- Request help with debt (online FSR form)
- Dispute debt (by email, askva, w/e... online form will be built eventually)

**Copay bills**
- Check balance for their facilities
- Pay bill (online through pay.gov, by phone, mail)
- Request help with debt (online FSR form soon)

**Other**
