# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience team - Benefit Payments and Debts, June 2022

## Background

Throughout [My VA payment information research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/user-research/payment-information-research-plan.md) in January 2022, the recurring theme mentioned by Veterans is that seeing financial info on My VA dashboard is a high priority. We gathered information during that research around what the critical pieces of information about a veteran's financials are, such as amounts and due dates.

Since the addition of benefit payments and debts on My VA, the importance of financial information is also reflected in analytics, as viewing payments is a top interaction on My VA and managing debt has performed well since its launch in April 2022.

This effort aims to iterate and build on the recent addition of benefit payments and debts by incorporating payment and debt details that will encourage action where necessary and include key pieces of information that veterans want to see on My VA.

### OCTO Objectives

The iteration of a financial information section should help fulfill our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items and benefit status, so that it provides more direct, personalized routes to Veteransâ€™ most critical updates and tasks, and a clear path to resolution.

### Veteran Journey

Since Veterans can incur debt any time after establishing benefits with VA, this work impacts the Veteran journey from Starting Up and beyond.

## Research Goals

### **1. Determine if the title of this section accurately conveys the content.**

- Before reviewing the content of the section, what do users expect to see in this section?
- What do users think that bills are?
- What do users think that payments are?
- After revealing the content of the section, are there any surprises?
- Is this information that veterans would want to see once they log into VA.gov?

### **2. Validate that the details displayed for debts and copays are the most important pieces of information for bills.**

- Do the titles give enough information to determine why the debt or copay is due?
- Do veterans find it useful to see the status of their debt or copay on My VA, or is this only necessary once diving further into VA bills?
- Is showing the amount for each type of bill useful on My VA?
- Does the usage of the dark red color for bills due convey a sense of importance and things that are due? Do colorblind and low vision users have any difficulty seeing the dark red text?
- Do veterans consider both debts and copays to be bills?
- Is the difference between debts and copays clear?
- Is there any important information missing in this section?

### **3. Validate that the logical next step for debts is effectively presented to the Veteran and they know how to take action on it.**

- How do users think they would go about paying or requesting help for one of these bills?
- What do users expect to happen when they click the Manage all VA debt link?
- Do users want to be able to click on an individual bill, or go to a page to view and manage all VA bills?
- What would a user do if they had questions about their bills?
- Would a user expect to see anything here if they had paid off a bill?

### **4. Validate that the most important pieces of payment information are being presented on My VA.**

- Is the difference between bills and payments clear?
- How many previous payments would a user like to see on My VA versus on their full payment history?
- Does the dark green color convey that these are payments that have been deposited to them? Do colorblind and low vision users have any difficulty seeing the dark green text?
- Is there any important information missing in this section?

### Outcome

We'll use the findings from this research to update the content and links in this section of My VA.

### Hypothesis

- We believe Veterans will find the bill information useful and be able to determine a path to resolve bills that are due from My VA.
- We believe Veterans will be able to tell the difference between amounts that are due and amounts that have been paid to them on My VA.
- We believe that surfacing more details about bills and payments is important to Veterans and is something they would want to see upon logging into the site.
- We believe that there may be some confusion around whether copays should fall under bills or belong under a healthcare-related section because feedback on this topic has been split fairly even so far.

## Method

We'll conduct remote usability testing over Zoom using a prototype in UXPin. This method will enable us to show copays, bills, and payments for all participants without restricting by which they currently have so we have a diverse user population to pull from. We will plan to test in production with a screen reader user before launch since that is a limitation of testing with UXPin.

## Recruitment

### Recruitment approach

We will recruit Veteran participants using a lean maximum variation strategy. We'll leverage Perigean's recruiting services to find our participants.

### Recruitment criteria

Schedule 16 Veterans for a minimum of 8 successfully completed sessions.

#### **Primary criteria (must-haves)**

- All participants should have received education benefit or compensation/pension payments from the VA. Screener question:

  - Have you ever received an education, compensation, or pension payment from the VA?

  - Answering yes would qualify the participant for the study.

- At least 50% of participants should have incurred education (CH 33, CH 34, CH 35), compensation/pension debts, or have a copay balance due. Screener questions:

  1. Do you have education, compensation, or pension debt with VA?
  2. Do you have health care related debt with VA?

  - Answering yes to question **1 OR 2** would qualify the participant for the study.

- All participants must able to screenshare via Zoom. Please confirm with them that they have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screenshare. If they can not get Zoom working, there is no interview portion of this research and they will not be able to participate.

- 50% of participants should be able to participant from a desktop device.

- 50% of participants should be able to participate from a non-desktop device (tablet or mobile phone).


#### **Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**

##### Gender
