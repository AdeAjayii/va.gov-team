## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Angela and I also have some colleagues on the line who will just be observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about a new feature we're adding to VA.gov to help Veterans get their recent details about VA payments and debts.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work. We want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the site, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.

- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

**Task goal: Confirm they qualify for the study, learn how they receive information from VA about financial things, and how that's meeting their needs.**

Before we look at the website, I'd like to get a little background information from you:

1. First, tell me a little about yourself.

2. As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you had either received payments from VA or incurred education, compensation, pension, or health care-related debt. Can you tell me how you got info from VA about updates on those payments or debts?
  
3. You mentioned that you receive updates on your payments or debts via *insert what the participant said*. What information about your payments and debts is included? Was that helpful? Was anything missing?
  
4. How do you manage your VA finances? Online, by mail, etc?

5. Let's talk about the website - how do you use VA.gov? *If they use it:* Do you ever visit My VA when you are logged in?
  

## First Task: Determine if the title of this section accurately conveys the content. - 3 minutes

**Task goal: Get feedback on the title of the section, whether it's clear what the content will be, and whether the title resonates with terminology Veterans are familiar with.**

Now I'm going to ask you to open a prototype from a link I'll post in the chat and have you share your screen. Just a reminder - it'll be very helpful if you think out loud and share what's on your mind as much as possible as you're looking at the prototype.

- Send link to prototype in Zoom chat *(Or do we share our screen and give them control?)*
- Ask participant to share their screen

We will be looking at a prototype as a fictional logged in user, so the content may not apply directly to you, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on a scenario where we'll imagine that they do. We'll be looking at a prototype of My VA and talking about a specific section.

Let's scroll down to the Debts and Payments section. Before we reveal the content in this section, can you tell me what type of things you think you'd see here just based on the title of the section?

What do you think "debts" refers to here? What about "payments"?

Okay, let's click once and we'll take a look at the content of this section.

- Reveal the content of the section by clicking anywhere on the page
### Things to watch for:

- Do users mention any types of debt and/or copays when they're thinking of what debts might be?
- Do users understand that payments will be paid to them, or do they think they are paid to the VA?
- Are there any negative reactions to the title?

## Second Task: Review and get feedback on details for debts - 8 minutes

**Task goal: Validate that the details displayed are the most important pieces of information for debts**.

- Let's take a look at the recent unpaid debts section. Can you describe to me what you think this section is for? What's standing out to you?

- Based on the titles of these line items here, tell me how you think you would have come to have these showing in your account. 

*Listen to hear if they are noticing some are debts and some are copays or if they don't make that differentiation.*

- On the 9/11 Post GI Bill debt where it says "We're reviewing your information", why do you think it says that instead of showing a due date?

- What's the most important piece of information you would want to know about a debt that you have?

- If you had these debts in your account, do you think you'd like to manage them from this website or some other way?

- Is there anything you expect to see here that you don't? Is anything about this section confusing to you?

*If user has colorblindness, ask:*
- Do you see the debt amounts in a different color than the other text? What color does it look like? Does the color differentiate this section from the next one at all? Is anything hard to see?

### Things to watch for:

- Do users understand why these amounts are due?
- What info is most prominent currently? Does that line up with what they say is the most important piece of information about debts?
- Do users notice that there are both copays and different types of debt in this section?
- Are veterans confused about why one debt has a status update instead of a due date?
- Is there any important information missing in this section?
- Do colorblind users struggle to see or interpret the dark red text?

## Third Task: Discuss action items in bills section - 5 minutes

**Task goal: Validate that the logical next step for debts is effectively presented to the Veteran and they know how to take action on it.**

- What do you think you'd want to do with this information?

- What would you do next if you wanted to pay or request help for one of these debts?

- What do you expect to see if you click the Manage your VA debt link?

### Things to watch for:

- Do veterans want to act on individual items or go to another page to see details about all of them?
- Do veterans know how to take action on debts that are due?
- What do veterans expect to happen if they click the Manage your VA debt link?
- Is the action link standing out enough?

## Fourth Task: Discuss details in the payments section - 5 minutes

**Task goal: Validate that the most important pieces of payment information are being presented on My VA.**

- Let's take a look at the section that says Recent payments deposited. Can you describe to me what you think this section is for? What's standing out to you?

- Based on the titles of these line items, tell me how you think you would have come to have these showing in your account. 

- Do you know where these payments were deposited to?

- Why are you seeing two payments here and a link to view your payment history?

- What's the most important piece of information you would want to know about your payments?

- Let's say you used to receive payments from the VA but now you don't anymore. How long do you think you'd want to see these past deposits in your account? If they were here for a set amount of time and then you could only access them in your payment history, what would you want that amount of time to be?

- Is there anything you expect to see here that you don't? Is anything about this section confusing to you?

*If user has colorblindness, ask:*
- Do you see the payment amounts in a different color than the other text? What color does it look like? Does the color differentiate this section from the previous one at all? Is anything hard to see?

### Things to watch for:

- Is it clear that payments are made to them from the VA?
- Are there any important pieces of information missing?
- How many recent payments do veterans want to see here?
- Is the action link standing out enough?

## Post Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Now that we've walked through this page a bit, let's talk about your thoughts on the overall experience.

1. How important is the information that we looked at today to you?
2. Is this something you would want to see as soon as you log in to VA, or something you might search out once in a while?
3. If you could change one thing about the section we just looked at together, what would it be?

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

That's everything I wanted to get your feedback on, thank you so much! This has been really helpful for our team. Do you have any questions or last thoughts for me before we end the session?

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!
