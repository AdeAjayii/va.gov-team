# Conversation Guide for Authenticated Experience team - Benefit Payments and Debts, June 2022

- [ ] Have link to prototype ready: [desktop]() and [mobile]()

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Angela and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about a new feature we're adding to VA.gov to help Veterans get their most recent details about VA payments and bills.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability; we are testing our work. We want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. As you go through the site, it'll be really helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible.

**If testing on production:**

- I'm going to ask you to log into va.gov. This means we'll be able to see your personal information once you are logged in. We won't record it or ask you to make any changes that will impact your VA information or benefits.
- The specific section of VA.gov I want your feedback in is still under development, so some things may not work quite as you expect them to.

**If using a prototype:**

- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

**Task goal: Confirm they qualify for the study, learn how they receive information from VA about financial things, and how that's meeting their needs.**

Before we look at the website, I'd like to get a little background information from you:

1. As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you had either received payments from VA or incurred education, compensation, pension, or health care-related debt. Can you tell me how you got info from VA about updates on those payments or debts?
  
2. You mentioned that you receive updates on your payments or debts via *insert what the participant said*. What information about your payments and debts is included? Was that helpful? Was anything missing?
  
3. How do you manage your VA finances? Online, by mail, etc?
  
4. Let's talk about the website - how do you use VA.gov?
  

## First Task: Determine if the title of this section accurately conveys the content. - 3 minutes

**Task goal: Get feedback on the title of the section, whether it's clear what the content will be, and whether the title resonates with terminology Veterans are familiar with.**

Now I'm going to ask you to go va.gov, and have you share your screen. I'd like for you to show me how you'd go about finding new information about your payments and debts.

And just a reminder, it'll be very helpful for you to think out loud and share what's on your mind as much as possible.

- Send link to prototype in Zoom chat *(Or do we share our screen and give them control?)*
- Ask participant to share their screen

We will be looking at a prototype as a fictional logged in user, so the content may not apply directly to you, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on a scenario where we'll imagine that they do.

Let's scroll down to the Bills and Payments section. Before we reveal the content in this section, can you tell me what type of things you think you'd see here just based on the title of the section?

What do you think "bills" refers to here? What about "payments"?

Okay, let's click once and we'll take a look at the content of this section.

- Reveal the content of the section by clicking through the prototype

### Things to watch for:

- Do users mention debt and/or copays when they're thinking of what bills might be?
- Do users understand that payments will be paid to them, or do they think they are paid to the VA?
- Are there any negative reactions to the title?

## Second Task: Review and get feedback on details for bills - 8 minutes

**Task goal: Validate that the details displayed for debts and copays are the most important pieces of information for bills**.

Taking a look at the outstanding bills section. Can you describe to me what this section is for? What's standing out to you?

Based on the titles of the bills, tell me how you think you would have come to have these showing in your account. 

*Listen to hear if they are noticing some are debts and some are copays or if they don't make that differentiation.*

On the 9/11 Post GI Bill debt where it says "We're reviewing your information", why do you think it says that instead of showing a due date?

What would you do next if you want to pay or request help for one of these bills?

What's the most important piece of information you see here?

Is there anything you expect to see here that you don't? Is anything about this section confusing to you?

*If user has colorblindness, ask:*

Do you see the amounts in a different color than the other text? What color is it? Does the color differentiate this section from the next one at all? Is anything hard to see?

### Things to watch for:

- Do users understand these amounts are due? What info is most prominent currently? Does that line up with what they say is the most important piece of information?
- Do the alerts stand out to the participant?
- Do they mention anything about alerts being on top and mixed into sections of the page?
- Is the link sufficient for participants to take action from the payment section?
- What does the participant think about timing for fiancial information?
- Where does the participant expect to see travel reimbursement info?

## Third Task: Review onsite notifications - 5 minutes

**Task goal: Validate that the design of the onsite notification is effective and does not present any usability hurdles, learn how participants would want to interact with the alert, and understand user expectations around onsite notifications.**

- Let's imagine that you recently incurred a new debt with the VA. How would you know about it based on what you're looking at here?

***Skip this if participant has debt and you are using production***

I want to get your input on another new feature, but since you don't have any debt, I'll show you in a prototype instead of on the live site. Let me send you a link in the chat, and resume the recording.

- Send link in chat. [desktop](https://preview.uxpin.com/45251888896c8dd47ef62aa20d3a89a334726ac1#/pages/145483168/simulate/no-panels?mode=i) and [mobile](https://preview.uxpin.com/45251888896c8dd47ef62aa20d3a89a334726ac1#/pages/145483175/simulate/no-panels?mode=i)
- Resume recording

- Now let's look specifically at the call-outs (yellow notifications) on the page. Tell me your thoughts on those.
  
- *If needed*:
  
  - What are your thoughts on how they're placed within the page?
    
  - What are your thoughts on the information shown in those call-outs?
    
  - What would you change about these call-outs?
    
  - If you were to click on 'Manage your VA debt', what would you expect to happen?
    
- Say you clicked on 'Manage your VA debt', viewed your debt, and then came back to this page, what would happen to this notification?
  
- Say you paid your VA debt, what would you expect to happen to this notification?
  
- Can you scroll down to the 'Benefit payments and debts' section. What would happen if you were to click on 'Manage your VA debt' here?
  
- What are your thoughts on having two similar notifications on the same page?
  
- Is it important for you to know how many new debts have been added, or only that you have new debt?
  
- Okay great, let's talk about the things you can do with these alerts. Talk me through what you can do with them. (**Note: this is to begin to evaluate dismissable vs non-dismissable alerts.**)
  
  - Why would you want to dismiss this alert?
    
  - What do you expect to happen after you dismiss it?
    
  - After dismissing an alert, how would you find that information again?
    
  - Why do you think some are dismissible and some are not?
    
- **If this question was already asked at the beginning, you can skip this**: And for this specific notification - a new debt has been added - after you log-in, when would you expect to see that information?
  
- One more specific thing I want your feedback on - do you have any experience with VA travel reimbursement? Show me where you'd look for that on this page.
  
  - Why would you expect to see that there?

### Things to watch for:

- Did the participant notice the alerts on the page without being directed to them?
- How does the participant feel about having call outs both at the top of the page and within sections?
- What are the participants reasons for wanting to dismiss at alert?
- What are the participant's expectations around dismissing alerts and finding that information again?
- At what point does the participant expect to see new debt information?
- How does the participant expect to find out about new notifications on VA.gov?

## Post Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Now that we've walked through this page a bit, let's talk about your thoughts on the overall page.

1. Have you ever used this dashboard on VA.gov?
2. Can you summarize what this page for?
3. What is confusing about this page?
4. What information is missing on this page?

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

That's everything I wanted to get your feedback on, thank you so much! This has been really helpful for our team. Do you have any questions or last thoughts for me before we end the session?

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

I hope you enjoy the rest of your day!
