# Benefit Payments & Debts UAT Findings Summary
**Who we talked to**
* Completed veteran session demographics:
	* 76yo white woman, 71yo white man, 38yo white non-binary, 44yo Black man, 36yo Hispanic man
* 5 out of 12 were completed sessions

**Tasks and Outcomes**
1. Task: Verified that the Benefit Payments and Debts section was showing up for them once we had the correct email associated with their account
	* For all users where we were able to verify what email was associated with their account and flip the feature for that account, they were able to see the section
	* For 2 out of 12 users, they did not see the section which we later realized was because of an incorrect email
2. Task: Asked if their payment info looked correct and if anything was confusing about it
	* 	One user did not realize the payment was a payment and thought it was debt because it was a similar amount to their debt and the number stood out to them more than “deposited”
	* All other users who had completed sessions did not say anything was confusing or incorrect about it
3. Task: Asked if their debts looked correct and if they found it useful to see the number of debts
	* All users who had debt said it was accurate and that the number of debts was useful to see
	* One user was confused to see their $0 debt balance before their payment. Important to note this user had never had debt before.
	* One user who didn’t have debt thought the style of the text made it easy to overlook.
5. Task: Had users click all links in the section
	* No issues with links
6. Task: Asked users where they would expect to see an outstanding copay on MyVA
	* 2 out of 12 users said they would expect to see it under health care
	* 3 out of 12 users said they would expect to see it represented as a debt under Benefit payments and debts

**Bugs:**
* None

**Other interesting findings:**
* One user thought healthcare-related prescription bills would count as debt because it’s something that he owes to the VA
* On Learn About VA Debt link, the participant said he would probably Google what VA debt was instead of reading the page. I asked why and he said because there’s a search at the top so I guess you have to search for the info anyway. (Some confusion around what the search bar was for)
* None of the users used assistive technology even though 4 of them said that they did in the Perigean tracker
