# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, My VA Benefit Payments and Debts UAT, October 2022
## Background
Throughout  [My VA 2.0 research and discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research)  in 2020 - 2021, the recurring theme mentioned by Veterans is that seeing payment info on their My VA dashboard is a high priority. The importance of payment information is also reflected in analytics, as viewing payments is a top interaction on VA.gov overall and is a top search term from the My VA dashboard.

This effort aims to add payment information to the My VA dashboard to be elevated for logged-in Veteran’s awareness and attention, as the MVP.

See our [product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history) for more details.

### OCTO-DE Objectives 
The addition of a payment information section should help fulfill our north star objective of moving toward My VA being the one-stop shop for action items and benefit status, so that it provides more direct, personalized routes to Veterans’ most critical updates and tasks


### Veteran Journey
Since Veterans can incur debt any time after establishing benefits with VA, this work impacts the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from Starting Up and beyond.
 

## Research Goals	
The primary goal of our UAT is to confirm that our MVP functionality works as expected.

As secondary goals, we’ll follow up on [our last usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings.md):
- We would like to validate that no major usability hurdles have been introduced during the iterations that have occurred, especially with the changes we made to the alert design.
- We would like to learn more about challenges experienced by people who use magnification, and have cognitive considerations.
- We would like to better understand whether or not it’s important to people see the number of outstanding debts they have.
- We would like to better understand Veteran expectations around co-pay information on My VA.

### Outcome
Based on the outcome of this research study, we will either release our MVP to production, or update our design to correct any significant usability hurdles people encounter.

### Research questions
- Does the functionality work as expected?
- Are Veterans able to take action on their payment or debt information without any usability hurdles?
- Is it important to Veterans with debt to see the number of outstanding debts they have, or just that they have debt?
- Do Veterans look for co-pay information on My VA under the health care section, or the benefit payments and debts section?

### Hypothesis
- Veterans will be able to easily take action on their payment and debt information from My VA.
- Veterans will not encounter any bugs in the Benefit payment and debt section.
- Veterans will not have strong opinions about whether copays are associated with benefit payments & debts or healthcare and could see it applying to either seciton.


## Method	
We'll have participants go through a list of specific tasks for UAT, and ask follow-up questions to get feedback on our usability related questions.

### Location
Remote, via Zoom

### Research materials
[Conversation guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/uat/uat-conversation-guide.md) 

## Recruitment	
Our intended audience for this research is mainly BIPOC Veterans, LGBTQ+ Veterans, assistive tech users, and Veterans with cognitive disabilities who have payments and debt with VA. We'll use Perigean to recruit them.

We are focusing our recruitment criteria on the marginalized groups we didn't speak with during [our last usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/payment-history/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings.md).

**Identity Assurance Levels**

- **IAL1:** Attributes, if any, are self-asserted or should be treated as self-asserted; there is no proofing process. (***Ex., User generated user name and pw***)

- **IAL2:** Either remote or in-person identity proofing is required using, at a minimum, the procedures given in NIST SP 800-63A. (***Ex., Id.me or Login.gov account***)

- **IAL3:** In-person or supervised-remote identity proofing is required. Identifying attributes must be verified through examination of physical documentation as described in NIST SP 800-63A.

`Assistive Tech and Cognitive Impairment will apply across cohorts`
- ***If you have no preference for a specific type***, just add your number to the ***ASSISTIVE TECH*** or ***COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT*** row.

### Screener

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  
 > **Example:** Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]
  
 Additionally, you may provide instructions for Perigean to follow to ensure a smooth set-up.
  
 > **Example:** ALL have a computer, tablet, or smartphone and are willing to complete their interview on one of those devices:
  - During the session, are willing to share over Zoom a web browser window on their device
  - Have a working microphone on their device
  - Have Zoom downloaded to their device prior to the session and know how to share their screen
