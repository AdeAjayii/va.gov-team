### Attendee Questions
- For the user with low vision, could they not read the black text or blue link?
     - They could not read the blue link
- Anticipate that there will be an increase in traffic to Debt page!
- Noticed top alert has close/dismiss icon, When does it reappear?
     - We plan to not show the alert again after it has been dismissed (inline with Craigâ€™s thought)
- The below notifications persist no matter what?
     - Yes correct. The top notification and in-line notifications are pulled from separate data sources/APIs
- Are we considering updating the top alert to reflect number of debts
     - As we iterate, we will consider more details to include
- Technical question on the zoom software being used, they used a magnifier?
     - Yes, they did not zoom the page itself, it seemed to be a magnifier that moves around the page.
- For people using mobile, were they using the app or mobile website?
     - Using the website in mobile view
- How did you use this in production?
     - We used a feature flag to allow the functionality for individual users (via email address they logged in with)
     - This was easier since My VA is built, and this was a new section on the existing page
- Have you scheduled future UAT or other testing, or are you done with that?
     - No, we haven't done UAT yet, hoping to combine UAT with more usability feedback.  Should start in the next few sprints.
     - Craig would like to join in on those sessions!
- Is the payment info available now?
     - Yes, payment and debt information is available on VA.gov today.
