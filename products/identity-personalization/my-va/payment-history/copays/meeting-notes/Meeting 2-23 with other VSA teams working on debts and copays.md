* Liz made a Mural board of the discussion here: [MURAL](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1645635865798/62b2ba968bc1631189210bd75cc0d06ac23e4d54?sender=lizlantz1528)
* Mikki arranged this meeting since various teams were working on copays and debts to collaborate
* In attendance: Authenticated Experience MyVA, VA Mobile, Debt Resolution, Health apartment
* VA Mobile App team is starting a card sort next week that may give us some insight into whether vets associate copays with healthcare or debt. It’s running until 3/14.
* Debt resolution team is working on combining VBA debt and copays in one place - there’s also a congressional mandate for vets to be able to access all financial info together
* Meg Peters brought up that copays will always have to be paid one by one - you can’t pay them as a lump sum like you can with debt
* Riley said debt is like a credit card balance and can be paid in full
* This group will continue to meet biweekly while related projects are in flight
