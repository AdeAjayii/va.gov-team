# Notes from reviewing meeting between Riley Orr and Meg Peters on financial debts and copays

* We may want to ask in UAT or usability testing if veterans understand what copays are because there’s not enough research to determine this
* May want to list the veteran’s copay rating on the MyVA card, or it might be sufficient if it’s on the copay page
* During our discovery research, Veterans overwhelmingly expect to find all money owed to VA together. This makes me think they would not be surprised and possibly prefer to see this info under payments & debts because they see it as a financial matter
* “Copay balance” and “bill” are terms that would be familiar to vets in looking for their copays. “Check details to resolve this bill”
