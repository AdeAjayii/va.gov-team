# What benefits use which direct deposit?

Last updated March 23, 2021

Given that there are two different backends for direct deposit — one for direct deposit for compensation & pension payments and one for direct deposit for edu — there is some (understandable) confusion on which benefits use which direct deposit mechanism. Here is a list of what we know as of now:

- **Disability benefits**: Uses direct deposit for disability and compensation benefits.
- **Pension benefits**: Uses direct deposit for disability and compensation benefits.
- **Most education benefits**: Uses direct deposit for edu benefits.
- **STEM (education) benefits**: This is an outlier that uses direct deposit for disability and compensation benefits despite being an education benefit.
