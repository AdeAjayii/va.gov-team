# Executive Summary

Currently, VA.gov is home to both **Direct deposit for compensation & pension** information and **Direct deposit for edu** information (currently in staging pending launch in March 2021). The original impetus behing adding this functionality to VA.gov was two-fold:

1. This was key functionality from eBenefits that we needed to move over in order to be able to retire eBenefits.
2. With regards to direct deposit for comp & pen, we originally moved this functionality over to VA.gov as a security measure. There were a large number of fraud incidence on eBenefits, and VA.gov was seen as the more secure option given our overall infrastructure and our ability to require 2FA in order to access direct deposit information.

## User Problem Statements

- As a Veteran, I want to securely access and change my direct deposit information so I can receive the money that I've earned from the VA.
- As a Veteran, I want to securely change my direct deposit information if I switch banks or need to receive money in a different bank account.
- As a Veteran who receives paper checks from the VA, I want to be able to switch to receive payments via direct deposit.
