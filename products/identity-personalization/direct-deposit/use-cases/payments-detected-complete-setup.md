# Direct deposit: user has set up direct deposit for both payment types

**Last update: June 17, 2022**


When an LOA3 user logged in with two-factor authentication navigates to the direct deposit page, and has set up direct deposit for comp+pen and education payment, they will be able to view and edit bank account information for both.

## UX and design
- Clicking the `edit` button button will enable edit mode within the corresponding section. A user can edit their routing number, account number, and account type.
- Bank name is automatically filled in based on the routing number; users can't edit their bank name.
- [Read more about edit mode here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/direct-deposit/use-cases/editing-account-info.md)
- There is no way for a user to completely remove a direct deposit account online.
