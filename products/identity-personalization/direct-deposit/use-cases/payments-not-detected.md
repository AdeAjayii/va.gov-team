# Direct deposit: user is not receiving compensation, pension, or education payments.

**Last update: June 19, 2022**

If a LOA3 user logged in with two-factor authentication navigates to the direct deposit page, and we don't detect they're receiving any kind of payments, they'll see messaging in both the comp + pen, and education sections telling them we don't detect they're receiving payments.

## UX
- Content guides user to next step, which is learning more about benefit eligibility
- [Desktop mock-up](https://www.sketch.com/s/1a920e73-1dcb-47c4-aae8-08656756c131/a/zxa2gRa)
