# Direct deposit for compensation and pension: user's account has been flagged for fraud

**Last updated June 27, 2022**

If an LOA3 user attempts to update their compensation and pension direct deposit information (DD), and the VA fraud team has placed a fraud flag on their accoun t, they're blocked from making an update.

**Note:** This does not apply to education direct deposit information.

## UX
- If a user doesn't have a valid phone number (home, work, or mobile) or mailing address in their profile, and they attempt to update their DD information, they will see an error message at the top of the DD form.
- Uses the [error alert component](https://design.va.gov/components/alert#error-alert) from the VA design system
