## Goals
The goal of this usability study was to assess how easily participants located, understood and could change their direct deposit information. We also wanted to determine the impact of having both direct deposit (DD) payment types (compensation and pension, and education) displayed.

**The goals of this document are to:**

- Ensure the study is in alignment with the perceived findings of observers and notetakers
- Consolidate insight from team/stakeholder/designers as we analyze the data, so that we align on specific directions to pursue

## Participants and testing sessions

We scheduled nine sessions beginning December 2; the last session was conducted December 7. Six of seven participants attended, and the final two calls were cancelled since we hit our goal of five completed sessions.

## Guiding questions

### Where on VA.gov do users expect to find direct deposit (DD) information?
Users were given the scenario: "You recently moved and changed banks; you need to update your direct deposit info to have your educational payments sent to your new bank." They were asked to go to VA.gov to find the DD feature.

- Every participant initially looked at the white quadrants when asked where they expect to find the DD feature
- Two looked at the Education quadrant; one looked at Disability, and one looked at Records
- Participants seemed inclined to go toward the last "payment" type mentioned in the prompt; from the examples above: EDU, C&P, and none respectively
- Two of the three younger users went quickly to log in; they went fairly directly to Profile and found the feature there
- The other four participants "wandered" a through content pages before finding their way to the DD landing page
- One user (100% service-connected disability), who had self-described cognitive problems, noted that it would be frustrating for users like them to read through all the text on the content pages looking for the link to the feature

### How often do users expect to review and/or update their DD information?
- Of the participants who were asked, one said they changed their DD info frequently
- The others said they (or a spouse) changed it "once" or not at all
- None of the users asked recalled having to initially set up DD payments
- There was a generational divide regarding where users would look to find their routing/account numbers: the younger participants would use a bank app or website; the older users said they'd look at a check or their bank statement

#### Landing page(s)
- Users who navigated to/or were shown the DD landing page were immediately drawn to the green or blue button directing them to sign in
- Users admitted they wouldn't read the text; most were looking for an action item
- Participants who were prompted to scan content pages scanned the content (older users), or ignored it (younger participants)

### What barriers prevent users from easily submitting changes to their DD info?
- The most significant hurdle for participants looking to change their DD info was the relative obscurity of the feature described above
- Every user said the feature itself was easy to use
- No user encountered any difficulty updating their DD information once they navigated to the prototype
- One user did not notice the validation error when they entered seven digits for the routing number
- One user suggested that it might be helpful or "elders" if the bank name appeared once the routing number was entered (rather than after submission)
- The note regarding bank fraud was universally missed; three participants saw the box only when prompted to scan the page

#### Expectations
- Almost every participant said they expected further notification that their DD change was made
- Email and texts were cited as examples for expected confirmation
- Several users expected a long wait if they needed to call the 800 number with an inquiry

### How do users react to the two different "categories" of payments--and having to change them separately?
- Almost all participant accepted that there were two DD features; one explained that it was acceptable since there were two types of payments
- One user was notably irritated that there were two direct deposit "boxes" and wanted to know why there couldn't be just one
- Users who were directed to change their EDU payments used the correct feature; participants who were not directed to a particular payment type, went to C&P first
- Participants generally accepted, and even regarded favorably the "you don't receive this kind of payment" notice

### What other features do users expect on the DD screen?
- The top improvement cited by participants was a chat-box for inquiries and confirmation
- Another notable suggestion was to move the "fraud" notice into the boxes themselves; every user initially missed the note about bank fraud


## Hypotheses

### Users may have some difficulty locating their direct deposit information
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consequetoru unum pluribus dolorum

### Users will rarely, some occasionally, change their direct deposit information
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consequetoru unum pluribus dolorum

### Participants will accept and easily navigate the DD edit function
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consequetoru unum pluribus dolorum

### Participants will have some questions/hesitation about two distinct Direct Deposit features
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consequetoru unum pluribus dolorum

### Users may want more information about the DD change proces
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consequetoru unum pluribus dolorum

## Other notes
- Several participants noted the View Payments link; three said they would reference payments if/when making changes to their DD info
- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consequetoru unum pluribus dolorum
