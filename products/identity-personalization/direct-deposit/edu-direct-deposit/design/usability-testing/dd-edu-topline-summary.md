## Goals
The goal of this usability study was to assess how easily participants located, understood and could change their direct deposit information. We also wanted to determine the impact of having both direct deposit (DD) payment types (compensation and pension, and education) displayed.

**The goals of this document are to:**

- Ensure the study is in alignment with the perceived findings of observers and notetakers
- Consolidate insight from team/stakeholder/designers as we analyze the data, so that we align on specific directions to pursue

## Participants and testing sessions

We scheduled nine sessions beginning December 2; the last session was conducted December 7. Six of seven participants attended, and the final two calls were cancelled since we hit our goal of five completed sessions.

## Guiding questions

### Where on VA.gov do users expect to find direct deposit (DD) information?
Users were given the scenario: "You recently moved and changed banks; you need to update your direct deposit info to have your educational payments sent to your new bank." They were asked to go to VA.gov to find the DD feature.

- Every participant initially looked at the white quadrants when asked where they expect to find the DD feature
- Two looked at the Education quadrant; one looked at Disability, and one looked at Records
- Participants seemd inclined to go toward the last "payment" type mentioned in the prompt; from the examples above: EDU, C&P, and none respectively
- Two of the three youngest users went quickly to log in; they went fairly directly to Profile and found the feature there
- Thre other four particiants "wandered" a little before finding their way to the DD landing page

### How often do users expect to review and/or update their DD information?

- Finding lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Finding lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Finding lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

### What barriers prevent users from easily submitting changes to their DD info?

- Finding lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Finding lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Finding lorem ipsum dolor sit amet The other user was irritated to "have to do everything over again," but continued on to successfully determine eligibility and complete the form, not knowing he completed the CH31 form

### How do users react to the two different "categories" of payments--and having to change them separately?

- Finding lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Finding lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Finding lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

### What other features do users expect on the DD screen?

- Finding lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Finding lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Finding lorem ipsum dolor sit amet

## Hypotheses

### Users may have some difficulty locating their direct deposit information
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consequetoru unum pluribus dolorum

### Users will rarely, some occasionally, change their direct deposit information
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consequetoru unum pluribus dolorum

### Participants will accept and easily navigate the DD edit function
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consequetoru unum pluribus dolorum

### Participants will have some questions/hesitation about two distinct Direct Deposit features
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consequetoru unum pluribus dolorum

### Users may want more information about the DD change proces
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consequetoru unum pluribus dolorum
