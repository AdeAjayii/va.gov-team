## Research goals
The goal of this usability study was to assess how easily participants located, understood and could change their direct deposit information. We also wanted to determine the impact of having both direct deposit (DD) payment types (compensation and pension, and education) displayed.

## Research methodology

**Our methodology:** Usability testing was conducted remotely using Zoom. We scheduled seven sessions beginning December 2; the last scheduled call was December 7. Six of seven participants attended, and sessions typically went 30 minutes. Participants were given tasks covering wayfinding and updating direct deposit information. Users were presented with a high-fidelity, fully-functioning prototype created using UXPin.

The moderator prompted users with tasks from the conversation guide. Participants were given a scenario in which they recently moved and needed to update the bank for their direct deposit payments. Users were encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototypes, and to speak candidly about their impressions. Remote observers and note takers were in attendance, and all sessions were recorded.

#### Who we talked to:
- Six Veterans total; five men, one woman
- Age range was 25 to 64
- All participants had a VA disability rating; three had ratings of 90% or higher
- Four participants live in or near major metropolitan areas; two in rural or outlying areas
- Participants live across the U.S. ranging from New York to California.
- Educational attainment ranged from some college to two participant having master's degrees
- All receive/received direct deposit payments from VA

#### Research questions
- Where on VA.gov do users expect to find direct deposit (DD) information?
- How often do users expect to review and/or update their DD information?
- What barriers prevent users from easily submitting changes to their DD info?
- How do users react to the two different "categories" of payments--and having to change them separately?
- What other features do users expect on the DD screen?

#### Hypotheses
- Users may have some difficulty locating their direct deposit information
- Users will rarely, some occasionally, change their direct deposit information
- Participants will accept and easily navigate the DD edit function
- Participants will have some questions/hesitation about two distinct Direct Deposit features
- Users may want more information about the DD change process

## Additional insights
- All but one participant opted to "sign-in" to proceed
- A few users felt to intro screen copy wasn't informative enough
- Some users wanted shorter, better defined "bullet points" to outline the process 
- Users were uniformly tripped-up by language around timeframes; e.g. the "have you been discharged in the last year" question in the wizard; users wanted to know if this meant 2019 or within the last 12 months
- Users who were asked to make an address change expected (but were not hopeful) that the change would populate all VA systems
- Several users wanted email confirmation that their forms were submitted
- The education level of participants in this study was extremely high: 6/7 had masters degrees

## Recommendations
1. Make language regarding program and its requisite form more clear.
- Establish link between U.S.C. chapter, program name, acronym and form number (e.g. Chapter 36, Personalized Career Planning and Guidance, PCPG, and VA Form 28-8832)
- Consistently couple acronym and form number in content
2. Make "skip to form" link more prominent.
3. Add clarifying language to potentially vague requirements and questions.
- "Within the last 12 month"s vs. "the past year"
- "Years of education including elementary, secondary and all college"
4. Put detailed information regarding CH31 communiction options into "tell-me-more" accordions to reduce page depth and visual clutter.
5. Offload CH31 language from CH36 intro screen to the CH36 confirmation screen, and increase its prominence there.
6. Provide email confirmation of sucessful submissions.

## Next steps
1. Review recommendations with team.
2. Share research finding with business stakeholders.
3. Work with content team to refine, clarify and minimize introduction text and wizard questions, along with form labels and instructions.
