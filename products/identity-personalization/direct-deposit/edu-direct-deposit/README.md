## The Problem

- Direct deposit for edu functionality still lives on eBenefits. Since we moved direct deposit for comp & pen to VA.gov last year, this means that veterans now need to update their direct deposit info in two different places.
- Historically, eBenefits has has issues around fraud + direct deposit. This is one of the major reasons we moved over direct deposit for comp & pen to VA.gov last year â€” VA.gov has greater security and requires 2FA for all users. With direct deposit for edu still on eBenefits, we're leaving that feature vulnerable.
- EBenefits is eventually going away, so we need to migrate all functionality over to VA.gov. Direct deposit for edu is still an outstanding project.

### User Goals

- Manage all direct deposite functionality in one place.

### Business Goals

- Move direct deposit for edu over to VA.gov so all functionality is in one place.
- Move direct deposit for edu over to VA.gov so we are one step closer to being able to retire eBenefits.

## Assumptions

- Direct deposit for edu functions similarly to direct deposit for comp & pen.
- There will likely be backend hiccups or complexity we haven't accounted for.
- Designing mockups will be simple. We should be able to use the new patterns set in the Profile 2.0 redesign.

## Questions

- Can people add direct deposit for edu on eBenefits if they are eligible but are currently receiving paper checks via mail?
- Who on the eBenefits team is the expert in direct deposit for edu?
- Can people at call centers update direct deposit for edu over the phone the way they can for comp & pen?
