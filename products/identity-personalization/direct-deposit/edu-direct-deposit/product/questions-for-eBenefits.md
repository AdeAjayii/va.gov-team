**Can you add direct deposit information if you are eligible but have not yet set up direct deposit (eg. You currently receive payment via checks, or didnâ€™t give bank info on a benefit application)?**

> Answer: Yes, you can. A claimant can fill out an application of submit a change-of-school form (VA Form 22-1995 or 1990) to VA. On the form instructions, this appears:
>  
> Item #5: The Department of the Treasury requires all Federal benefit payments be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), also called direct deposit(Direct Deposit is not available for Chapter 32 recipients). To enroll in direct deposit, please attach a voided personal check, deposit slip, or provide the information requested in Item 5. If you do not have a bank account, please visit https://www.benefits.va.gov/benefits/banking.asp. This website
provides information about the Veterans Benefits Banking Program (VBBP), and a link to banks and credit unions that may fit your needs. You may also call 1-800-827-1000. If you elect not to enroll, you must contact representatives handling waiver requests for the Department of the Treasury at 1-888-224-2950. They will encourage your participation in EFT and address any questions or concerns you may have.

**Can people still use VA Form 29-0309 to enroll in direct deposit, or is this being phased out like form 0296?**

Even though this form appears to be for direct deposit for any benefit, it's not. This form is actually for direct deposit for insurance purposes only. It is not an edu direct deposit form.

**Is there a list of exactly which education benefits use the education direct deposit information? Since we know there is some weirdness around some education benefits using the comp & pen direct deposit information, we wanted to see If there is a list somewhere of what benefit uses which direct deposit info.**

Answered by Jeffrey Pomietlarz via email on 10.19.20:

> Answer: All of our benefits, except for Chapter 32 which only technically exists, utilize direct deposit when paying benefits. Chapter 35 allows for direct deposit now also, but has to cycle one month before the direct deposit information holds. So I am not entirely sure of the premise of the question, but all of our benefits are supposed to accept and use direct deposit information.

## BGS

- BGS has confirmed that there should be no restriction on non-veteran dependents accessing direct deposit for edu info if they're eligible to view it. This was confirmed on 10/19/20 by Mahesh Raparti from CSRA.
