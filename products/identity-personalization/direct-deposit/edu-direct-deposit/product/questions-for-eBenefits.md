## Ebenefits

These were discussed with/answered by Luke Tickner in October 2020.

**Can you add direct deposit information if you are eligible but have not yet set up direct deposit (eg. You currently receive payment via checks, or didnâ€™t give bank info on a benefit application)?**

**Can people still use VA Form 29-0309 to enroll in direct deposit, or is this being phased out like form 0296?**

Even though this form appears to be for direct deposit for any benefit, it's not. This form is actually for direct deposit for insurance purposes only. It is not an edu direct deposit form.

**Is there a list of exactly which education benefits use the education direct deposit information? Since we know there is some weirdness around some education benefits using the comp & pen direct deposit information, we wanted to see If there is a list somewhere of what benefit uses which direct deposit info.**


## BGS

- BGS has confirmed that there should be no restriction on non-veteran dependents accessing direct deposit for edu info if they're eligible to view it. This was confirmed on 10/19/20 by Mahesh Raparti from CSRA.
