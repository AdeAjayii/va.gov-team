# Direct Deposit for EDU Release Plan

## Phase I: UAT
### Planning:

- **Desired number of users:** 10
- **How you'll recruit the right production test users:** We will recruit users via Perigean.
- **How you'll conduct the testing:** We will conduct UAT over Zoom to ensure the different features work correctly.
- **How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov:** The feature will be behind a feature flag. 
- We need to make sure to include users who have education benefits.
- **Research plan for UAT**: To be added 

### Results/Issues:

Phase 1: Test with team (1 day)
Phase 2: 25% of users (1 week)
Phas
**Desired date range:** 3/24-4/6
**Link to GA Dashboard:** TBD


### Stage 1: 25% of users
#### Planning
- Length of time: x (_minimum 2 hours_)
- Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): x% (500 users) (_Recommendation: select a percentage that targets ~500 users, or at most 10%_)
#### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- What UX changes (if any) are necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges?

### Stage B: moderate
_Test a larger population of users to make sure there are no issues exposed by larger usage patterns._
#### Planning
- Length of time: x (_minimum 1 day_)
- Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): 25% (x users)
#### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- What UX changes (if any) are necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges?
_More stages? Sure! If it makes sense for your product! Plan them out with the same structure as above._

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
