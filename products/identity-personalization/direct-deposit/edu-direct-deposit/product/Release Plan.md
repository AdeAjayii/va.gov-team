# Direct Deposit for EDU Release Plan

## Phase I: UAT
### Planning:
- **Desired date range or test duration:** 2/25 - 3/1 (5 days)
- **Desired number of users:** 10
- **How you'll recruit the right production test users:** We will recruit users via Perigean.
- **How you'll conduct the testing:** We will conduct UAT over Zoom to ensure the different features work correctly.
- **How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov:** The feature will be behind a feature flag. 
- We need to make sure to include users who have education benefits.
- **Research plan for UAT**: To be added 

### Results/Issues:
- **Number of users:** TBD
- **List of bugs/issues found:** TBD

## Phase II: Staged Rollout 
### Planning
- Desired date range: _\[mm/dd/yy - mm/dd/yy\]_
- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it: \[_lorem ipsum_\]
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?: \[use your KPIs to help guide this. It could be things like _abandonment rate < 20%_, _reported contact center calls < 2 calls_, _error rate < 5%_, etc.\]
- Links to dashboard(s) showing "success criteria" metrics: _\[link here\]_

_The stages and number of users below are provided as example values recommended by VSP, but can be customized to your team's needs._

### Stage A: Canary
_Test a small population of users to make sure any obvious bugs / edge cases are caught._
#### Planning
- Length of time: x (_minimum 2 hours_)
- Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): x% (500 users) (_Recommendation: select a percentage that targets ~500 users, or at most 10%_)
#### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- What UX changes (if any) are necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges?

### Stage B: moderate
_Test a larger population of users to make sure there are no issues exposed by larger usage patterns._
#### Planning
- Length of time: x (_minimum 1 day_)
- Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): 25% (x users)
#### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- What UX changes (if any) are necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges?
_More stages? Sure! If it makes sense for your product! Plan them out with the same structure as above._

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
