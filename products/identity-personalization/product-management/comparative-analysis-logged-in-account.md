# Comparative analysis: Logged-in account models

**Last updated: January 29, 2024**

### Goal of this document

As VA.gov has continued to integrate more logged-in tools from eBenefits and MHV, the logged-in experience on the site has become increasingly messy. Many tools are buried in content pages, there are multiple logged in homepages (the actual homepage, My VA, and the MHV landing page), and there is increased pressure on My VA and the Profile to manage all aspects of the logged-in experience because there aren't other viable paths.

It's clear we need to be thinking of the logged-in experience more holistically beyond My VA and the Profile. This document aims to cover different models for how we can treat the logged-in experience going forward.

## The retail model

### What is this?

On retail sites, logging in doesn't change much. The user is still able to access the same homepage and content as they were before they logged in. Most of the site is still the same with the exception of some navigational changes, like a user menu, and pages where people can manage personal and payment information.

**Why this is significant**: The retail model is closest to how we've currently structured VA.gov, and it's a viable option should we choose to continue in this direction. However, we need to make some serious improvements in how we're implementing this model in order for it to be usable.

### Example 1: Target.com

#### The homepage

Target's website functions a lot like VA.gov. Whether you're logged in or logged out, the homepage stays the same, and the navigation stays mostly the same with the exception of a user menu.

#### The user menu

One thing that Target does somewhat differently than VA.gov is that its sign-in CTA is also a menu. Once a user logs-in, the menu expands to include additional, personalized pages.

#### The Account page

The account page acts as both a dashboard and a menu to other personalized tools. It is not a duplicate of the user menu, but there is significant overlap.

#### The Settings page

Target doesn't have a page called "Profile." Instead, the site refers to this information as "Settings." The Settings overview acts as both navigation and as a preview of the information within the profile. This might be something we want to consider for our own profile.

### Example 2: Amazon.com
