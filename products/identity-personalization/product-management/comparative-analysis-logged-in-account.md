# Comparative analysis: Logged-in account models

**Last updated: January 29, 2024**

### Goal of this document

As VA.gov has continued to integrate more logged-in tools from eBenefits and MHV, the logged-in experience on the site has become increasingly messy. Many tools are buried in content pages, there are multiple logged in homepages (the actual homepage, My VA, and the MHV landing page), and there is increased pressure on My VA and the Profile to manage all aspects of the logged-in experience because there aren't other viable paths.

It's clear we need to be thinking of the logged-in experience more holistically beyond My VA and the Profile. This document aims to cover different models for how we can treat the logged-in experience going forward.

## The retail model

### What is this?

On retail sites, logging in doesn't change much. The user is still able to access the same homepage and content as they were before they logged in. Most of the site is still the same with the exception of some small navigational changes and a page where people can manage personal and payment information.

Why this is significant: The retail model is closest to how we've currently structured VA.gov, and it's a viable option should we choose to continue in this direction.

### Example 1: Target.com

### Example 2: Amazon.com

## The "portal" model
