# Files to move from vets-team repo

## Background

When we originally were moving files from the vets.gov-team repo to the va.gov-team repo, I didn't understand that files were being duplicated and not moved permanently. I thought adding files to va.gov-team would remove them from the old repo, and I wanted to make sure the historical records were preserved. Therefore, a lot of stuff that should have gotten moved didn't because I didn't understand the actual outcome. Now that I understand that files will be duplicated and not removed, I'd like to move some of the files that we still need and are still relevant to the new va.gov-team repo.
