## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about navigating a VA website when you’re signed in. Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes/60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- **Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary.** You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype today.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your VA information or benefits.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
  - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
  - If yes: Admit observers.
  - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
  - Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
  - Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
- **Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences?** One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
  - Knowing this, **would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?**
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **Are you comfortable if we decide to use a recorded clip from our discussion today to share with other VA partners if we remove any information that can be used to identify you?**


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at anything, I’d like to learn a little more about your experience with VA.

1. According to my notes, you have [benefits from VA]. Is that correct?
2. Do you ever log into any VA websites? 
   - *If yes*: Which website? tell me about how you use that once you’re logged in.
   - *If no*:  What websites do you sign into? How do you use those websites?
   - *Moderator goal:* gather background info that might be helpful later in the session

## First Task: Design authenticated menu - 10 minutes

Now we’re going to do a quick exercise to help me understand what would be most helpful to get you to where you need to go when you’re logged in.  

### For sighted participants: 
I’ve set up a bare bones digital drawing of a VA webpage ([mural link](https://app.mural.co/t/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/m/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1704919248748/7c3f93534f193882990dbdb152b902b2755dc176?sender=ub868d471cfdb1c56cc0b4512)), which I’m going to show you via a screen share.

*Start screen sharing*

Can you see my screen? Great.  I want to build a menu with you that will help you get to the things you expect when you’re logged into VA.gov.  Do you see your name on the page? What should be in that box below it?

*Work with participant to elicit expectations for their logged in menu. Once finished asked:*

What would you call this kind of menu?
What other links would you expect to see in the navigation of VA.gov when you are signed in?

### For non-sighted participants:
I want to talk to you about a menu that will help you get to the things you expect when you’re logged into a site.  Have you encountered scenarios before on websites where you click on your name and a menu appears?  

What would you call that menu?  Let’s build one for you for a VA.gov

*Work with participant to elicit expectations for their logged in menu. Once finished asked:*

What other links would you expect to see in the navigation of VA.gov when you are signed in?

### Things to watch for:

- What does the participant put in their authenticated menu?
- What do they call their menu?
- What else do they expect from navigation options when logged in?
## Second Task: Navigate to profile - 5 minutes

Thanks so much for going through that.  I’m going to stop screen sharing. 

Now I’d like to get your feedback on a prototype and have you share your screen. Do you know how to share your screen in zoom?

*Guide participant through screen sharing if needed*

Great, I can see your screen. Next, I’ll have you pull up the prototype. Would you prefer I send you the link via Zoom chat or tell you the URL verbally so you can enter it in? 

TK: Prototype link
*Guide participant to prototype.*

Excellent, I can see the prototype on your screen.  Just as a reminder, since this is a prototype, not everything is clickable or fully functional.  It’ll be helpful if you can think out loud as much as possible so I can understand how this prototype works for you. 

Let’s imagine you need to update the address on file with VA. Show me how you’d do that from here.

*Expectation is user will sign in and be taken to the My VA page. We will remove the profile link in My VA in the prototype. From there, they will attempt to navigate to profile. May need to guide user to click on auth menu / name to get there.*

How was that experience for you? How did it line up with what you expected?

### Things to watch for:

- How easily does the participant understand how to log in and navigate to the profile?
- Were any usability hurdles encountered?

## Third Task: Navigate to disability rating - 3 minutes

Next, I’d like for you to show me how you’d navigate to view your disability rating. 

*Expectation is user will try to use a menu to navigate. May need to guide user to click on auth menu / name.*

How was that experience for you? How did it line up with what you expected?

### Things to watch for:

- Did the participant initially try to use the general or auth menu? 
- Did the participant understand how to get back to their auth menu?
- Were any usability hurdles encountered?

## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes

Those are all the things I wanted you to go through on the prototype. I want to get your thoughts on a few more things before we wrap up.

1. Can you click on your menu again? Take a look at these links and tell me where you expect each of them to go?
2. What’s missing from this menu in your opinion?
3. Overall, about everything you've seen in this session...What worked *well* for you?
4. What was *unclear or didn't work well* for you?
5. What would you like to *change or add*?
6. Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know?

## Consent to use video clips

I want to circle back and re-confirm that **you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners?** Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
- If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?


## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
