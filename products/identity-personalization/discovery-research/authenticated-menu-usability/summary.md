# Topline Summary for Federal Header Authenticated Menu
February 2024

This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is **not the final result of working with the data discovered**. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

* To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
* To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
* To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes.

## Notes about this study
- We talked to 12 participants in total
  - 4 participants evaluated the **desktop view of the header**. All used a form of assistive technology
  - 8 evaluated the **mobile view of the header**
- No one easily found the authenticated menu in the first 6 sessions. We wondered if it was because the first two tasks in our protocol asked them to find items that weren’t intuitive to find in a personal menu. **We changed the order of our tasks for the last 6 sessions,** so that the first task would be to find an item that is conventionally under a personal menu (profile).

## Initial Findings
### 8 of 12 participants struggled to find the authenticated menu.
#### Desktop view (4 participants total)
* 2 screenreader participants had to be guided to the menu button and did not understand what it was when they landed on it.
  > My name is there. But normally it would say first name, and then it would say last name. But it just says [my first name] What am I supposed to do with that? I don't understand.  - P4, screenreader user

* 1 participant using CCTV noticed the menu immediately after signing in because the button label changed to their name
* 1 screenreader participant was completely unfamiliar with web pages and we did not ask them to try to find them menu.
#### On mobile (8 participants total)
* 3/8 did not find the menu without being guided by the moderator.
  > *Moderator guides participant to open main menu*.
  > 
  > M: Do you see the option that says [participants first name]?
  > 
  > P3: I do not see that. I see, oh god, oh I’m staring right at it. I’m sorry, I didn’t see that before...It’s in a different form than the rest of the page. If it were highlighted with a blue background like the other choices are, I probably would have clicked on it right away.


* 3/8 found the menu without being guided, but initially expected it to be in the upper right corner of their screen.
  * 2 did not notice the auth menu until the 3rd time they opened the main menu, when they were asked to complete a profile-related task.
  > I would expect, this, where it says [firstname], I think general convention, I'm used to seeing that in the top right corner. Most Google and many others have your profile in the top right coner. I was looking to the right of the dept of VA logo for my picture, my profile picture and my name. - P2


* 2 participants easily opened the menu for the first task, a profile related task.
  * For the subsequent task, find your disability rating, 1 of the 2 participants had to be guided back to the menu. They had not recalled seeing that option previously.
  * The other participant first clicked on the US Department of Veteran Affairs text before opening the main menu. When asked why they clicked, they shared they were looking for their name in the heading:
  > When I looked at the page, normally It has like my google symbol or something on the right side. And it has my name, so I know that if I hit on my name then that's my profile. When I didn't see it, and it just says "sign out", I figured the U.S.A. government sign, that should take me to the home page which should also open the place for me to able for me to be able to go in and change my phone number. - P16
