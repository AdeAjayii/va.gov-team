## Overview

We're looking to run a lightweight experiment by adding links into the "personalized menu" for [Dependents ](https://staging.va.gov/view-change-dependents/view)and [Letters](https://staging.va.gov/records/download-va-letters/).

- [We saw evidence in Liz's logged-in navigation user research from April that we need to elevate dependents](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/comprehensive-research-summary.md#its-hard-to-get-to-tasks-when-theyre-not-obviously-linked-from-the-homepage-my-va-or-the-mega-menu). People had significant trouble finding dependent information on the site, and many people said they expected to find dependent information in the profile.
- In analytics, variations on "dependents" and "letters" make up the majority of the top 10 search terms in the profile. [These are the stats for the last six months](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1689612516606549?thread_ts=1689606177.353799&cid=C909ZG2BB).

However, we're looking for a lighter weight solution than fully integrating these sections into the profile. By adding things into the personalized menu, we're hoping to catch people a step earlier than the profile. We plan to experiment with this solution, see if it moves metrics, and determine next steps based on the outcome.

## Problem Statement

Users have trouble finding dependent information and where to download their benefit letters. Through research and analytics, we have observed people expect to find these things in the VA.gov profile, but those things are currently not linked from there.

## Desired User Outcomes

- *Why would a user want to use this? With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

- By elevating dependent and letters in the personalized menu, users should be able to more easily find these tools.

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Users still look for dependent and letters in the profile.

## Desired Business Outcomes

*Why would your business want this to exist? With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

- Adding links to dependents and letters to the personalized menu is a significantly lighterweight solution than fully integrating these sections into the profile, and even easier than simply linking to these pages from the profile.
- This may help prove out that we can/should more holistically leverage the personalized menu to support the authenticated experience.

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Adding these links to the personalized menu doesn't move metrics, and we're back at square one.

#### Baseline KPI Values
Jan 1-July 18, 2023

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*
Modifying the personalized menu is a developmentally low cost potentially high impact change. 
## Solution Approach


The feature is currently built, this is a minor adjustment/update to what is listed/linked there. 
This proposed change shouldn't have a ton of developoment demands and could be rolled out very quickly allowing us to  guague if our guess is correct. 
Modifying the personalized menu is a small initiative with potentially large impacts to help users.

- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*
- [Link to Release Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/product-management/release-plan-template.md)

This is currently launched, we would be making very minor changes to the options listed in the UI. A release plan will be created after we have a collab cycle kick off conversation around the changes.
