# Onsite Notifications Use Cases
**Last updated:** November 2, 2022

For all use cases, the user must be LOA3 (identity verified). If the user is not LOA3, they will see a prompt to verify their identity and only be able to apply for benefits (see LOA1 documentation - link tk).

## Common Use Cases

### User logs in with LOA1 account
