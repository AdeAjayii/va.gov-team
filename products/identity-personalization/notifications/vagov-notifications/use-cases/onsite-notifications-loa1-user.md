# Onsite Notifications: LOA1 User
Last updated: November 1, 2022

A user is considered "LOA1" when they log in to VA.gov and they have not verified their identity with any of the credentials we support. LOA1 users who sign into VA.gov are immediately prompted to verify their identity on My VA. They will not see any onsite notifications until they have verified their identity.
