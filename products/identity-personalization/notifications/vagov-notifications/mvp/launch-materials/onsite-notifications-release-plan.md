## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
