# Onsite Notifications Internal UAT Findings Summary
**Testing methodology**
* My VA team worked with VA Notify to trigger notifications for internal users to do mini UAT
* Triggered notifications for 5 internal users on the profile team
	- Liz Lantz, Christina Gednalske, Tom Harrison, Sharon Kasimov, Samara Strauss
* Triggered multiple notifications for some users; one notification for others
* Angela reached out to each participant via Slack and asked for the following:
	- Send screenshots on desktop and mobile of the Notifications section on My VA
	- Click the link in the notification and confirm that it takes you to the combined debt portal
	- When prompted, dismiss notifications and confirm that the Notifications header disappears.

**Tasks and Outcomes**
1. Task: Send screenshots on desktop and mobile of the Notifications section on My VA
	* All screenshots looked as expected and users received as many notifications on their dashboard as we asked VA Notify to trigger for them
	* Example from a user who we sent 3 notifications:

2. Task: Asked if their payment info looked correct and if anything was confusing about it
	* 	One user did not realize the payment was a payment and thought it was debt because it was a similar amount to their debt and the number stood out to them more than “deposited”
	* All other users who had completed sessions did not say anything was confusing or incorrect about it
3. Task: Asked if their debts looked correct and if they found it useful to see the number of debts
	* All users who had debt said it was accurate and that the number of debts was useful to see
	* One user was confused to see their $0 debt balance before their payment. Important to note this user had never had debt before.
	* One user who didn’t have debt thought the style of the text made it easy to overlook.
5. Task: Had users click all links in the section
	* No issues with links
6. Task: Asked users where they would expect to see an outstanding copay on MyVA
	* 2 out of 12 users said they would expect to see it under health care
	* 3 out of 12 users said they would expect to see it represented as a debt under Benefit payments and debts

**Bugs:**
* None

**Other interesting findings:**
* One user thought healthcare-related prescription bills would count as debt because it’s something that he owes to the VA
* On Learn About VA Debt link, the participant said he would probably Google what VA debt was instead of reading the page. I asked why and he said because there’s a search at the top so I guess you have to search for the info anyway. (Some confusion around what the search bar was for)
* None of the users used assistive technology even though 4 of them said that they did in the Perigean tracker
