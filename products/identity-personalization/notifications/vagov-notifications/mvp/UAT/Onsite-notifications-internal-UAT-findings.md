# Onsite Notifications Internal UAT Findings Summary
**Testing methodology**
* My VA team worked with VA Notify to trigger notifications for internal users to do mini UAT
* Triggered notifications for 5 internal users on the profile team
	- Liz Lantz, Christina Gednalske, Tom Harrison, Sharon Kasimov, Samara Strauss
* Triggered multiple notifications for some users; one notification for others
* Angela reached out to each participant via Slack and asked them to perform a few tasks as outlined below.

**Tasks and Outcomes**
1. Task: Send screenshots on desktop and mobile of the Notifications section on My VA
	* All screenshots looked as expected and users received as many notifications on their dashboard as we asked VA Notify to trigger for them
	* Example from a user who we sent 3 notifications:

	* No issues with link
3. Task: When prompted, dismiss notifications and confirm that the notifications and section header disappears.
	* Dismissal worked as expected for all users.


**Bugs:**
