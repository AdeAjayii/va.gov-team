# Onsite Notifications QA Strategy
See [#34543](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/34543) for reference

## Initial planning/strategy questions:

| Question | Answer |
|------|-------|
|1. When will our work be done?| |
|2. When will VA Notify's work be done?| |
|3. Does VANotify need to be part of this? If so, who on their team should participate?| |
|4. Does Tze need to be part of this? If so, what does he need to do? Or can he just take a look at things once the notification has already been sent?| |
|5. What use cases do we need to test (single notification, multiple notifications, etc)? We'll want this so we can make sure the backend team sends us exactly what they need.| |
