# Onsite Notifications QA Strategy
See [#34543](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/34543) for reference

## Initial planning/strategy questions:

| Question | Answer |
|------|-------|
|1. When will our work be done?| Targeting end of current sprint (by 5/31). Taylor is wrapping his FE work ([#36034](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/36034), [#40710](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40710), [#41482](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/41482)), Tom has one ticket ([#41268](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/41268)) to complete that will enable VA Notifty to be able to complete connectivity testing with our API.|
|2. When will VA Notify's work be done?| Targeting by end of their current sprint which ends 5/27. They need Tom to complete [#41268](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/41268) (See above). |
|3. Does VANotify need to be part of this? If so, who on their team should participate?| Yes, sounds like they should. According to Melanie they'd like to have their QA person involved (see POC table below). |
|4. Does Tze need to be part of this? If so, what does he need to do? Or can he just take a look at things once the notification has already been sent?| _Initial answer is yes. Meeting scheduled for 5/25 to discuss with him._ |
|5. What use cases do we need to test (single notification, multiple notifications, etc)? We'll want this so we can make sure the backend team sends us exactly what they need.| _TBD - hoping to answer at 5/25 meeting_ |
