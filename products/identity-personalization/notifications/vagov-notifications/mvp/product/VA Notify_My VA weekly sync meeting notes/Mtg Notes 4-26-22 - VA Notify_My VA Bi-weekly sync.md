### Questions for discussion with VA Notify  as a result of conversation with Debt Resolution team
1. Will we be able to receive data that tells us the date of a debt notification? If we do, that would enable us to set a time limit on it so it wouldn’t stay on a veteran’s My VA view forever if they didn’t dismiss it themselves.
   Answer: 

2. Discussion that may need to be had between backend engineer and VA Notify - is there a way we can dismiss a debt notification if it is paid?
