## Overview

VA.gov is in the process of implementing a comprehensive communication strategy to support email, text, and in-app (ie. on VA.gov) notifications. Currently, the VANotify team  builds and manages email notification support for VA.gov, and they are working in tandem with VEText to integrate support for text messages into their platform. 

The third and final pillar -- notifications that show to logged-in users on VA.gov -- is finally ready for MVP development by the auth. experience team. For our MVP, we plan to prioritize action items, ie. tasks which require veteran action to move a process forward, as well as other notifications that currently have email support in VANotify. Our work will be supported by the VANotify platform so that all notifications (email, text, on VA.gov) can be managed in a single place as part of a coordinated communication effort.

## Problem Statement

- As a customer of the VA, I need to know if there are tasks I need to complete so that I can receive or manage my benefits.
- As a customer of the VA, I need to know if the VA has updated something related to a benefit application or my existing benefits.

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes
- VA.gov users will be able to find and complete necessary tasks more quickly.
- As a result, VA.gov users may receive benefits or other outcomes more quickly.
- VA.gov users will also have a better sense of the current status of their benefits and information.

### Undesired User Outcomes
- Confusion or lack of syncing between on-site notifications/action items and email, text, or mail communications (data integrity). We can avoid this by building on the VANotify platform to ensure a synchronous experience between email, text, and notifications on VA.gov.
- An overwhelming amount of notifications makes it so that this update feels more like noise than a helpful tool.

## Business outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes

- We'll create a unified experience through the VANotify platform. 
- It will be easier for the VA to get necessary action items and notifications in front of users than it is now.

### Undesired Business Outcomes

- This tool becomes a bandaid for bad information architecture and navigation.
- This tool is over-utilized and results in more noise than guidance.

## Measuring success

OKRs and KPIs TBD

## Solution approach

We have already completed design discovery, which will inform our technical discovery and MVP planning. We will be building on the VANotify platform to ensure a unified communication experience.
