## Overview

The VA is ramping up their digital communications efforts, specifically through email and text. As a result, veterans need to be able to opt in or out of communications and customize through which channels they prefer to be contacted. To meet these organizational and user needs, the VA.gov profile supports notification settings, which are powered by the [VA Profile backend](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/external-integrations). This section is also managed in close partnership with [VANotify](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/VANotify.1885634900.html), which manages all notifications.

## User Outcomes

### Desired user outcomes

- As a veteran, I want to be able to see what types of communications I am eligible to receive.
- As a veteran, I want to be able to select where and how I receive those communication (eg. receive emails for claim updates; receive texts for appointment reminders).
- As a veteran, I only want to have to keep this information updated in one place.

## Business Outcomes

### Desired business outcomes

- Allow veterans to set and manage communication preferences from their VA.gov profile.
- Allow any updates veterans make to their permissions to be saved/accessed across the VA (through VA Profile backend).
- Set up an infrastructure for this functionality that is sustainable and allows us to scale easily over time.
