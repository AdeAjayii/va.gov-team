## The Problem



### User Goals

- As a veteran, I want to be able to select where and how I receive communication from the VA.
- As a veteran corresponding with the VA, I want to be able to set different communication preferences for different scenarios and circumstances (eg. receive emails for claim updates; receive texts for appointment reminders).

### Business Goals

- Allow veterans to set and manage communication preferences from their VA.gov profile.
- Set up an infrastructure for this functionality that is sustainable and allows us to scale easily over time.

## Assumptions

- It will be fast and easy for us to add in new preferences after the initial infrastructure is in place.

## Questions

- After the initial infrastructure set up, what notification preferences will we need to accomodate?

## Requirements

### In Scope

- 

### Out of Scope

-

## Solution Approach

- 

## Value Propositions

- Veterans will be able to update how they want to receive different types of communications from the VA.
- Since this is integrated through VA Profile, those preferences will be consumable across the VA. So, that means that veterans should only have to update these preferences in one place — either the VA.gov profile, through a call center, etc — and that info should get updated everywhere.

## KPIs

- TBD
