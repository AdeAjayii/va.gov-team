# Product definition questions

These are for our initial feature definition meeting with Terry on 1.19.21.

- What data fields should we account for?
   - Groupings:
    - Who determines these groups? Are they pre-determined, or will they be added/defined over time and pulled in from the backend?
  - Notification type (eg. Health care appointment reminders; Prescription updates; COVID updates, etc)
  - Communication type:
    - Email, text, phone, mail, do not contact?
    - Are there MVP types (eg. email and text) we should account for now, while other types (eg. phone and mail) we should account for later?
- What data will be hard coded vs. what will be pulled in dynamically from VA Profile?
- How do we determine what permissions groups/options show for which user?
- Who is defining each permission/preference?
  - Who is responsible for things like copy/content for each preference type? How can we assure that any copy/labels meet the VA.gov style guidelines?
