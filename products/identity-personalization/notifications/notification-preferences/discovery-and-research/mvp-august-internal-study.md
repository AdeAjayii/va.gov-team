## Overview

We've made some significant changes to our design since our [usability test in June](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/notification-preferences/discovery-and-research/notifications-research-findings.md), but won't have the opportunity for additional usability testing before launch.  Our changes include an [experimental design pattern](https://design.va.gov/experimental-design/input-message), an alert at the top of the page to drive engagement, and using radio buttons instead of checkboxes.

We also wanted to learn if using a modal to drive traffic to the notification settings page would be effective.

To get ensure there aren't any blatant usability issues with these changes, we ran 5 moderated sessions on Zoom with internal colleagues who are also Veterans.  We asked each participant to interact with a [UX Pin prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/51ca6ecd7ddaf2ceaf75f94e2b2ccbed2a193f6d#/pages/141256292/simulate/sitemap?mode=i), though the modal was added after the first participant.

## Findings

1. 4 participants were able to easily update their settings, and understood their setting had auto-saved.  

2. One participant looked for a save button after checking the radio inputs.  

   - When prompted, they stated that they weren't confident their changes had been saved and would feel more confident if there had been a save button to press.

3. 4  participants missed the "Manage your health email notifications on MHV" link. 

4. 3 participants had questions about why both text and email notifications were not available for each notification item.  They thought both should be an option since both pieces of contact information were on file.

5. 2 participants wanted to dismiss the modal without reading it; 1 stated they normally don't read modals but "this looks important" so they went ahead and read the modal. 

   - We gave participants a scenario that they had just logged into VA.gov to change their address in their profile. The modal was displayed on the profile landing page ([prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/51ca6ecd7ddaf2ceaf75f94e2b2ccbed2a193f6d#/pages/141163648/simulate/sitemap?mode=i)).
   - One participant wanted a "remind me later" option in the modal because they didn't want to be interrupted while completing their task.

6. 2 participants used the "Select your notification options" link to go down the page; the remaining participants either didn't use it, or only used it after being prompted.

7.
