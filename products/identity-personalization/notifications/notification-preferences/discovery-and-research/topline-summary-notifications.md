This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

The goal of this document is:

* To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
* To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
* To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Perceived Findings

### It was not intuitive for participants to look in profile to manage notification settings.

### Participants clearly understood they needed to add contact information before having the option to opt-in to a notification channel.

### Participants experienced frustration and confusion when leaving notification settings to update their contact information.

### Participants did not easily understand the distinction between their sign-in and contact email address.

### Some participants struggled to understand which notifications were turned on or off, and which channel they were coming to.

### Participants assumed all notifications would be available through email and text, and couldn't guess confidently as to why a notification may only be available through one channel.
