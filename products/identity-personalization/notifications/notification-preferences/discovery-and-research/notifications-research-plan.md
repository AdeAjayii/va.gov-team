# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, Notification Settings, June 2020

## Goals	

### What product & team are you doing this research for?	

Profile notification settings, Authenticated Experience

### Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The VA is ramping up their digital communications efforts, specifically through email and text. As a result, veterans need to be able to opt in or out of communications and customize through which channels they prefer to be contacted. To meet these organizational and user needs, the VA Profile team is building a communications permissions engine that will integrate with the VA.gov profile frontend and allow veteran-managed settings to be saved and shared across systems at the VA.

See our [MVP definition](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/notification-preferences/product/communications-permissions-mvp-definition.md) for more details

### Questions we hope to be able to answer through this research

- What kind of notifications do people expect to be able to receive from the VA?
- Where do people expect to be able to manage notifications?
- What notifications are people currently receiving from the VA?
- What notifications are they not getting that they wish they did?
- Does our "edit per group" pattern introduce any usability hurdles?
- Do people understand that `checked` = notifications on and `unchecked` = notifications off?
- Do people understand the groupings? 
- Are the checkbox labels sufficiently explicit?
- What expectations do people have around "unsubscribe from all" or "enable/disable" functionality?
- Will people be confused about why some notifications have 2 channels and others have 1?

- What words do people use to talk about or search for notification content?

- What kind of static content support makes sense for this section of profile?

- Is the preview text (On: emails, text) meaningful and helpful?

- If someone has partial contact info on file:

  - do they understand email/text is also available when they don't have a checkbox to click?
  - do they know how to add that information?
  - do they know how to get back to notification settings once they add info?

  

### Our hypothesis for this research



## Method	

1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
   - **Sample Methodologies**: Directed interviews; ethnographic interviews; observation; card sorts; tree tests; guerilla usability testing; usability testing with low- or high-fidelity prototypes; user acceptance testing. 	
   - **Also mention:** in-person moderated, remote moderated, remote unmoderated	

2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
5.	If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	

## Participants and Recruitment	

1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
   (Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-

1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 

- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
   (If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)	

## When? 	

1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
   (IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
3.	Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	

## Team Roles	

Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	

- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
  **List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
