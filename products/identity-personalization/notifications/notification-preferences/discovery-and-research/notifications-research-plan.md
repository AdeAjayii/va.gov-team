## Key findings

### It was not intuitive for most participants to look in profile to manage notification settings.

Our first task asked participants where they would go to either set up or turn off notifications.  6 of 8 participants did not go to the profile; rather they looked on the homepage under various sections such as health care and records.  We prompted them if there is anywhere else they would look; many said they would use search and type in something about text messages or notifications.  

> Probably under health care. I would say under refill and track your prescriptions. or, I guess, the other thing I could do if I didn't find it there, I'd probably go up into the search block. - P3

> I might go up to the search function at the top of the page and type something in there to look for text messages or communications with the VA. - P9

Once exposed to the profile menu options (My VA, My Health, Profile), most participants stated they would expect to find notification settings under My VA.

> "I would probably go to My VA and hopefully have another drop down for whatever MY VA would be- might give options for text or options to update profile or whatever the case may be" - P6

### Participants clearly understood notification groups, but had less confidence in individual notifications.

- All participants correctly understood the notification groups

- People seemed less sure about notification names and made comments that suggest their expectations don't align with what we're planning (need to dig into this)

  - Scheduled payments. A couple participants didn't see the value in this notification since it wasn't something that changed often.

    > Not sure what benefit payments and debts are here. Education benefits? - P16

    > I don't know why that would exist because it is not something that changes often. - P10

  - Applications in progress (I think one participant misunderstood this)

  - Prescription shipment and tracking updates

    - People had a hard time associating this with the first task when we said "updates on your medications"
    - One participant thought they'd be able to update their shipping address here if it was incorrect
    - Another participant thought they'd see tracking numbers here

### Participants clearly understood they needed to add contact information before they can receive notifications through that channel.

We wanted to validate our approach to communicating that a person has missing contact information on file, and must provide that information to receive notifications via that channel.  100% of participants clearly understood the messaging throughout the notification settings page telling them they needed to provide missing contact information to get notifications there.

### Participants experienced usability hurdles when updating their contact information outside the notification settings page.

In [task 4](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/notification-preferences/discovery-and-research/notifications-conversation-guide.md#task-4-update-contact-information-and-sign-up-for-email-notifications---8-minutes), we asked participants to sign up for email notifications, which required them to add an email address on the personal and contact information page of our prototype. After going through the task, 6 of 8 participants  stated it would be easier for them if they were able to add the email on the notification settings page.

> "It's a lot of button clicking and hunting to put your information in to get that piece of information sent to you. It would've been better if once you click on the edit button, and type your email address in right there, and click add." - P11

Leaving the notification settings page to add an email address left caused confusion and a lack of confidence that the task had been completed:

- 2 participants thought they had completed the email sign up task simply by adding their email address.

  > "I clicked on the edit for the contact email address and now here I would put my email and press update. I should start receiving updates via email. And now my new email is up and I think that's it." -P2

  > "Your contact email address is showing, and that box is not empty no more, so I would assume it's done." - P14

- 2 participants were totally unsure whether or not they had completed the sign-up process

  > "I have not a clue. Because all you've done is added your email, you don't know whether the notifications are coming or not" - P11

- 4 participants felt there was too much back and forth going between notification settings and the personal and contact information page.

  > "It was confusing going back and forth between the contact section." - P3

### Some participants struggled to understand which notifications were turned on or off, and which channel notifications were coming to.

### Participants assumed all notifications would be available through email and text, and couldn't guess confidently as to why a notification may only be available through one channel.

> The VA just didn't make it an option on the website. I don't know why not. It seems like if they can do prescriptions and you get text or email option, you should probably get a text or email option on appointment reminder. - P11

### Multiple participants would turn off all notifications by manipulating their phone number or calling the VA, instead of managing them at the notification settings level.

### Many participants are already getting notification from the VA.

### Our design doesn't make notification channel options clear.



## Additional findings

### Participants had mixed feelings about the profile name tag.

>I like the profile banner with basic information (with the name, branch) I would tell you there are people that served in multiple branches. VA tends to function on the last one you separated from, that's the one they think of you as. But there may be someone that served in 2-3 branches. It's not very often that that happens, but just having on the back-end, an option where multiple branches could be included or where they chose their primary branch. - P10

> Like if someone wanted a copy of my letter stating I'm 100% disabled vet, I could just click on that. You know, log into VA.gov, go to my profile, click on that, and my letters would automatically pop up instead of going through everything I've had to go through in the past.- P16

### Participants were confused about the distinction between their sign-in and contact email address.

> "I was trying to see something about COVID, and I didn't see it but then I remembered I clicked on email. So, I guess I have to be verified. Now that's a lot of work. Y'all are going to make me go to another website." - P2

> It seems kind of dumb, if you just put it [email address] in there down below. It's kind of a conflict because it's saying you have to go there [[ID.me](http://id.me/)] to udpate your email address, but you've already got it down there. Maybe I'm missing a big point...If you're dealing with someone that has issues, mental, physical, this could really put a cog in the wheel - P6



## Working space

- People didn't struggle with missing/partial contact information, other than 2 participants commented it was odd that there wasn't a contact email address on file if they used an email to log in
- Most participants expected or wanted to be
