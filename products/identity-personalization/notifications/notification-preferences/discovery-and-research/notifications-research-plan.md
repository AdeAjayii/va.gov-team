# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, Notification Settings, June 2021

`Draft`

## Goals	

### What product & team are you doing this research for?	

Profile notification settings, Authenticated Experience

### Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The VA is ramping up their digital communications efforts, specifically through email and text. As a result, veterans need to be able to opt in or out of communications and customize through which channels they prefer to be contacted. To meet these organizational and user needs, the VA Profile team is building a communications permissions engine that will integrate with the VA.gov profile frontend and allow veteran-managed settings to be saved and shared across systems at the VA.

See our [MVP definition](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/notification-preferences/product/communications-permissions-mvp-definition.md) for more details.

### Questions we hope to be able to answer through this research

1. What expectations do Veterans have about managing notifications?
2. What kind of notifications do people expect to be able to receive from the VA?
3. What words do people use to talk about or search for notification content?
4. How do people expect to be able to discover notifications they're not currently opted in to?
5. Does our solution enable Veterans to manage their notifications without encountering UX hurdles?
6. Are we providing sufficient contextual information through group and notification names?
7. Do people expect to be able to update their contact info right here on the page?
8. How do people feel about sharing their contact email address and mobile number with VA?
9. If someone has partial contact info (missing a phone or email from their profile), do they understand how to make updates so they can get notifications to that channel?
10. Does a person with partial contact info they understand email/text is also available when they don't have a checkbox to click?
11. Do they know how to get back to notification settings once they add info?
12. What kind of static content support makes sense for this section of profile?
13. Questions about the API likely to come once we see it in action....

### Our hypothesis for this research study

- People will expect to be able to manage notifications from their profile.
- People expect to be able to discover notifications they're not opted into via channels outside their profile - VAMC/call center interactions, campaigns, etc.
- Our solution will allow people to intuitively manage their notification settings.
- The group and notification names will be easily understood.
- Having to go to the contact info section to update email or phone number will not be ideal, but it will be acceptable.
- People will know how to get back to notification settings after updating their contact information.



## Method	

### What method of research are you planning? 	

This will be a remote moderated usability test with a high-fidelity prototype.	

### Why this method?

A remote study will allow us to test with participants around the country. Testing with a high-fidelity prototype will provide insights to our research questions before investing time in engineering.  We'll start people a screen with partial contact information to help us evaluate our overall design, and help us understand:

- if our solution for partial contact info works for people
- If people expect to be able to edit/update contact information right on the page
- If people can get back to notification settings after they've updated their contact information

### Where are you planning to do your research? 

Zoom

### What will you be testing?

A UXPin prototype 

**Q: test on desktop or mobile? I can see merits to both.  I normally test with 5-8 participants; we could expand the study a bit and do 5 on each device, or perhaps 4 on each would be sufficient? Would love your thoughts.**

## Participants and Recruitment	

### What are you looking for in a participant?	  

We'd like to talk to 10 Veterans who have a logged into VA.gov and used text messaging in the last 6 months.

Screener question

Have you used text messaging on a mobile phone in the last 6 months? Answer should be yes.	

Have you logged into VA.gov in the last 6 months? Answer should be yes.

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-

1. **Primary criteria / Must have**

   

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 

- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
   We will draw from 

## When? 	

1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
   (IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
3.	Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?
