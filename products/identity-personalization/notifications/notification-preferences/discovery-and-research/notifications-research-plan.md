# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, Notification Settings, June 2021

`Draft`

## Goals	

### What product & team are you doing this research for?	

Profile notification settings, Authenticated Experience

### Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The VA is ramping up their digital communications efforts, specifically through email and text. As a result, veterans need to be able to opt in or out of communications and customize through which channels they prefer to be contacted. To meet these organizational and user needs, the VA Profile team is building a communications permissions engine that will integrate with the VA.gov profile frontend and allow veteran-managed settings to be saved and shared across systems at the VA.

See our [MVP definition](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/notifications/notification-preferences/product/communications-permissions-mvp-definition.md) for more details.

### Questions we hope to be able to answer through this research

1. What expectations do Veterans have about managing notifications?
2. What kind of notifications do people expect to be able to receive from the VA?
3. What words do people use to talk about or search for notification content?
4. How do people expect to be able to discover notifications they're not currently opted in to?
5. Does our solution enable Veterans to manage their notifications without encountering UX hurdles?
6. Are we providing sufficient contextual information through group and notification names?
7. Do people expect to be able to update their contact info right here on the page?
8. How do people feel about sharing their contact email address and mobile number with VA?
9. If someone has partial contact info (missing a phone or email from their profile), do they understand how to make updates so they can get notifications to that channel?
10. Does a person with partial contact info they understand email/text is also available when they don't have a checkbox to click?
11. Do they know how to get back to notification settings once they add info?
12. What kind of static content support makes sense for this section of profile?

### Our hypothesis for this research study

- People will expect to be able to manage notifications from their profile.
- People expect to be able to discover notifications they're not opted into via channels outside their profile - VAMC/call center interactions, campaigns, etc.
- Our solution will allow people to intuitively manage their notification settings.
- The group and notification names will be easily understood.
- Having to go to the contact info section to update email or phone number will not be ideal, but it will be acceptable.
- People will know how to get back to notification settings after updating their contact information.

## Method	

### What method of research are you planning? 	

This will be a remote moderated usability test with a high-fidelity prototype.	

### Why this method?

A remote study will allow us to test with participants around the country. Testing with a high-fidelity prototype will provide insights to our research questions before investing time in engineering.  We'll start people a screen with partial contact information to help us evaluate our overall design, and help us understand:

- if our solution for partial contact info works for people
- If people expect to be able to edit/update contact information right on the page
- If people can get back to notification settings after they've updated their contact information

### Where are you planning to do your research? 

Zoom

### What will you be testing?

We'll test with a [UXPin prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/bb87d0fa61a32938a47e7bcdc836db235ab77576#/pages//simulate/sitemap?mode=i).

**Q: I'm not sure whether we should test on desktop or mobile, or both?  I don't have any significant concerns about either one that would push me one way or the other.  Previous studies we've run had 5-8 participants; we could expand the study a bit and do 5 on each device, or maybe 4 on each would be sufficient? I think the research questions would benefit from a prototype that is as close to the real thing as possible, which means I need to figure out how to create states in UX Pin. I've heard it's tedious and time consuming, so we may be forced to choose only one in the interest of time/effort. **
**Would love your thoughts.**

## Participants and Recruitment	

Recruit for 10 fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants

- All participants must: 
  - be Veterans or primary caregivers
  - have logged into VA.gov **and** used text messaging in the last 6 months. 

(**Assuming we go 50/50 on devices** )

- Half of the participants must be able to participate from a laptop/desktop device
- Half of the participants must be able to participate from a mobile device

#### Additional questions to ask in the screener

- Have you used text messaging on a mobile phone in the last 6 months? *Answer should be yes.*	
- Have you logged into VA.gov in the last 6 months? *Answer should be yes.*

### Good to have for participants

- At least 3 women
- At least half of the participants identify as a person of color
- At least 2 participants under 30 and 2 participants over 55
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least one person with a disability rating of 70% or greater
- At least one person with an identified cognitive consideration of PTSD or TBI

### Recruitment requirements

- All must have a laptop/desktop or mobile device and be willing to be complete their interview on said laptop/desktop or mobile device
- The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
- The participants know how to screen share
- Note that our prototype isn't compatible with assistive technology

### What is your recruitment strategy? 	

We will leverage Perigean's services to recruit participants.

## Timeline

#### Desired Timeline: May 17-19, 2021 

45 minute sessions<br/>
**Schedule at least 15 minute breaks in-between sessions.**
