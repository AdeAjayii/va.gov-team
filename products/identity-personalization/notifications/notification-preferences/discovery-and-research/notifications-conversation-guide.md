## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is __________ and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.  We have a team working on a new section of the VA.gov profile that will help you manage email and text notifications from the VA.  During our session today, I'd like to hear your thoughts about notifications, and get your feedback on this new section of the site. I want to make the distinction that we're not talking about mobile push notifications or reminders you get from an app - our conversation will be specific to notifications you get via email or through an SMS text message.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30-45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, I want to hear your honest opinions.** I'm not testing your ability, and there are no right or wrong answers. Our team wants to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your honest feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** It may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Do you have any questions for me?**
- **I'd like to I record my screen and audio as we talk today, if that's alright with you.** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable with me recording screen and audio for our session?
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I've started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, I'd like to talk to you about notifications.

- Tell me about any email or text notifications you've received recently.
- What kinds of notifications do you currently get from VA? ~Are those emails or text messages?~
  - How do you receive them?
- What kinds of VA notifications would be helpful to you that you aren't currently getting? 
  - Where would you expect to find out about them?
- What kind of contact information do you have saved in your profile? 
  - Why ~do/don't you have a contact email address or mobile number?~ did/didn't you chose to include that infomation?
-  How do you manage your notifications? 
  - ~What prompts you to go into "manage mode"?~ Aim for more plain language, consider: What makes you manage them? 
  - Where do you go to do this?
- Let's talk about turning notifications on or off - 
  - When do you need to do this? 
  - How do you go about doing that?
- ~How do you find out about new notifications available to you?~ awkward phrasing, consider instead what I added to the VA notifications bullet above, and see if that is getting at the intent behind this question. or consider instead: *Let's say you wanted to get notified about VA offerings, where would you expect to find out what things you can get notified about?* (or something to that tune)
  - ~Do you ever seek them out?~  What's an instance where you might want to get more notifications from the VA?
- What devices do you normally use ~to do complete this type of task~ to do things on your VA Profile/VA.gov?

### Things to watch for

- Where do people go to manage notifications?
- At what point do they manage notifications? 
- What words do people use to talk about or search for notification content?
- How do people find out about new notifications?
- What expectations do people have regarding turning notifications on or off?
- What VA notifications are they not getting that they wish they did?
- Why don't people have complete profile information?

## Task 1: Navigate to notification settings - 2 minutes

*Send link to prototype, starts on homepage*

Imagine you heard the VA had recently started giving people the option to get text updates on their medications. From here, show me where you would go to set that up for yourself.

### Things to watch for

- How did the participant expect to be able to navigate to notification settings?
- How easily was the participant able to find notification settings?

## Task 2: General impression - 5 minutes

*Participant should be on notification settings page of profile.  Example profile does not have an email address on file.*: add desktop links

Thank you. Please don't click on anything just yet. Take a look at this page and talk me through what you see here.

- What can you do on this page?
- What notifications are you currently signed up for?
- Based on what you see here, how will you get notifications for American Legion Events?


### Things to watch for

- Is it helpful for people to see the contact information where notifications will be sent?
- Do people understand the notification names and groupings? 
- Is the preview text (e.g. `On: emails, text`) meaningful and helpful?
- Is the treatment of partial contact information confusing to anyone?
- Do people expect to be able to edit their contact information right here on this page?

## Task 3: Update and save settings for an existing channel - 5 minutes

1. Thank you, all of that is helpful for our team.  Now, please go ahead and see if you can sign up for text updates on your medications. 

2. *After saving:* Now that you've made some changes, take a look at the screen. Is this what you expected?

3. How would you sign up to also get email updates on your medications?

   *Note: since the example profile doesn't have an email saved yet, there will be text in place of a checkbox for any notifications that have emails available.*

### Things to watch for

- Does our "edit per group" pattern introduce any usability hurdles?
- Do people understand that `checked` = notifications on and `unchecked` = notifications off?
- Are the checkbox labels sufficiently explicit?
- How did the participant find a notification with emails? Was it difficult for them to find it?
- Did the "If you'd like to receive email notifications..." copy make sense to the participant?
- Did the participant get confused as to why some notifications have text and email, and others only have text?

## Task 4: Update contact information - 5 minutes

*Prompt if needed - participant may do this on their own:*
Imagine that **(email notification)** is really important to you.  Show me how you'd go about setting that up so you could get that notification.

_Consider instead:_ Let's say your phone number (or email address) was wrong (or you needed to add it), how would you fix it? <-- _can update to reflect whatever content ends up in the final prototype, aim is to figure out how they would handle updating or adding contact info from here_

### Things to watch for

- How did the participant become aware that they were missing contact information?
- Did they expect to be able to edit their contact information right here on this page?
- Which link did they click on to navigate to the personal/contact information section of the site (first instance of `Update your contact information`, alert instance of `Update your contact information`, or via profile navigation?
- Did they get frustrated that they were not able to edit contact info right in the page?

## Task 5: Add email notification - 5 minutes

- Now that you have an email address, how would you you set up that notification now?

~Do you see any other ways you can be notified about the same thing?  Why don't you think so?~

**Q: With this second question, I'm trying to evaluate if people understand why some notifications only have one channel, and if that causes any frustration when that's the case. Would love some help phrasing this in a way that's not leading and can help us get to this information. I'd like to avoid having them click through every group until they find one - plus it would be a lot of work in the prototype to set that up so it feels realistic. **

A: I may be missing the context on this, but I'm guessing some of the non-health notifications, like the 526 are email only, and can't do text updates. In that case, you could ask the participant something like "How would you change how you get notified about your 526 process", and then follow up with "What are your thoughts on the option(s) here", and dig in more with "why do you think these are the option(s)?". I agree, the wording if a little awkward, and reading the task as is, I'm not clear on where in the prototype or what exactly you're aiming to test right now.

### Things to watch for

- Were they able to get back to notification settings without any major hurdles?
- What were their thoughts regarding why some had 1 channel and others had 2?

## Post-Task Interview - 4 minutes

- Tell me how that overall experience aligns with your expectations for managing notifications.
- ~Would you expect to see transactional notifications here? Example: Say you called a VA help number and the rep sent an email after the call to serve as a record of your conversation.~ this feels leading and I'm not sure on the intent behind the question. Consider instead: What notifications would you expect to see here that you didn't?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
