## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes.  We have a team working on a new section of your VA.gov profile that will help you manage notifications from the VA.  Today, I'd like to hear your thoughts about notifications, and get your feedback on this new section of the site.

**provide definition/context of what we're talking about with notifications**

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, I want to hear your honest opinions.** I'm not testing your ability, and there are no right or wrong answers. Our team wants to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your honest feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** It may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Do you have any questions for me?**
- **I'd like to I record my screen and audio as we talk today, if that's alright with you.** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. Are you comfortable with me recording screen and audio for our session?
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I've started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, I'd like to talk to you about notifications.

- Tell me about notifications you've received recently.
- Talk to me about how you manage those notifications. 
  - What prompts you to go into "manage mode"? 
  - Where do you go to do this?
- How do you find out about new notifications available to you?
  - Do you ever seek them out?
- Talk to me about turning notifications on or off - how do you go about doing that?
- What kinds of notifications do you currently get from VA? How do you get them?
- What kinds of VA notifications would be helpful to you that you aren't currently getting?
- 

### Things to watch for

- Where do people go to manage notifications?
- At what point do they manage notifications? 
- What words do people use to talk about or search for notification content?
- How do people find out about new notifications?
- What expectations do people have regarding turning notifications on or off?
- What VA notifications are they not getting that they wish they did?

## Task 1: Navigate to notification settings - 2 minutes

*Send link to prototype, starts on homepage*

Imagine you heard the VA had recently started giving people the option to get text updates on their prescriptions. From here, show me how you would set that up for yourself.

### Things to watch for

- Was the participant able to find notification settings?

## Task 2: General impression - 5 minutes

Please don't click on anything just yet. Take a look at this page and talk me through what you see here. 

### Things to watch for

- Do people understand the notification names and groupings? 
- Is the preview text (e.g. `On: emails, text`) meaningful and helpful?
- Is it helpful for people to see the contact information where notifications will be sent?
- Is the treatment of partial contact information confusing to anyone?
- Do people expect to be able to edit their contact information right here on this page?

## Task 3: Update and save notification settings - 5 minutes

1. Now, please go ahead and update your settings.
2. *After saving:* Now that you've made some changes, take a look at the screen. How does this line up with what you expected?

### Things to watch for

- Does our "edit per group" pattern introduce any usability hurdles?
- Do people understand that `checked` = notifications on and `unchecked` = notifications off?
- Are the checkbox labels sufficiently explicit?
- 
- Does anyone express confusion about why some notifications have 2 channels and others have 1?

## Task 4: Update contact information - 5 minutes

Imagine that **(email notification)** is really important to you.  Show me how you'd go about setting that up so you receive that.

### Things to watch for

- How did the participant become aware that they were missing contact information?
- Did they expect to be able to edit their contact information right here on this page?
- Which link did they click on to navigate to the personal/contact information section of the site?
- Were they able to get back to notification settings without any major hurdles?
- Did they get frustrated that they were not able to edit contact info right in the page?

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Tell me how that overall experience aligns with your expectations for managing notifications.
- Would you expect to see transactional notifications here? E.g. An email from the call center confirming the conversation you had.
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
