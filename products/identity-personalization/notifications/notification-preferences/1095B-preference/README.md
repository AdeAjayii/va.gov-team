# 1095B preference: Requirements

## Overview

The health apartment team is working on an effort to allow veterans and other health care recipients to download their 1095B (proof of health care) tax form from VA.gov. Part of this effort requires that veterans be able to opt-out of the mailed copy of their 1095B in favor of the digital download. The 1095B would like to work in partnership with VA.gov, VA Profile, and VANotify to make this happen.

## Functionality needs

The 1095B team has a long list of functionality that needs to support this effort. This is the functionality that is required from our team:

- Support a notification preference in the profile that allows veterans to opt into and out of a mailed copy of their 1095B. This would connect to VA Profile.

**Major caveats**

While this sounds simple, the request from the 1095B team doesn't fit into how VA Profile's system actually works. Right now, VA Profile supports **permissions**, ie. do or do not send me a message, but not **preferences** ie. how a message is sent, like via mail or digitally. Despite this, VA Profile is trying to be as accommodating as possible given that turning off mailed copies of the 1095B would save the VA a lot of $$$ on mail. So, VA Profile is basically trying to fit this request into the current system.
