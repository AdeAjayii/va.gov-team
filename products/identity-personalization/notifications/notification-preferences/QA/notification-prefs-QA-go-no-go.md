# `Notification Preferences` QA Go / No Go 
## `mm/dd/yyyy`

## Decision:

Have we submitted the request for QA?
- 

Does Tze have everything he needs, i.e. have we submitted test cases, provided staging credentials, etc.?
- 

Have test cases been loaded into test rail?
- 

Is the feature complete on staging?
- 

Will all of our known "pre-QA" findings be resolved by end of sprint?
-  

Have we received sign-off on IA?
- 

Have we received approval on all content/copy?
-
