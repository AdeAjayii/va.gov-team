# Research Plan for Dragons: Dashboard 2.0 Discovery

## Goals
1. **What product & team are you doing this research for?**

Dragons/Personalization. This is research will kickoff the Dashboard 2.0 redesign project.

2. **Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?** 

Prior to Spring 2018, the Vets.gov logged in experience was limited to an account page that aggregated a fraction of the personalized information we had available on the site at the time. Through extensive research done by the Veteran Experience Office and other partners, we knew that veterans wanted to see and manage all benefited-related information in one place, so the newly-formed dragons/personalization team set out to create a more robust logged in experience. The My VA dashboard was launched as part of this effort and included four features — Your Applications, Track Claims, Secure Messaging, and Prescription Refills — along with links to personal records and the newly-created profile and account settings pages. 

Since then, the dashboard has grown, adding the Find VA Benefits tool and health care application tracking and enrollment statuses. But with the addition of these new features, the dashboard's single-column, content page-like design has quickly become cumbersome, long, and hard to navigate. Additionally, the information architecture of the MVP dashboard divided sections by content type (eg. applications and claims) instead of by benefit, which has made it hard to track progress across a benefit lifecycle.

To fix these problems, the dragons/personalization team is planning a Dashboard 2.0 redesign. This project aims to visually redesign and restructure the existing dashboard so that content is easier to consume, updates are easier to see and track, and the dashboard is better positioned to grow and accomodate additional functionality over time.

3. **Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?**

- How do veterans want to find, track, and manage their benefits? What might happen on the dashboard vs. other places?
- How do people use the existing dashboard?
- What do people find helpful and useful on the existing dashboard? What, if anything, is unhelpful?
- How do people feel about the existing dashboard IA? Would they prefer for the dashboard to be organized by benefit?
- What causes confusion?
- How can the dashboard be improved so that it is more useful and usable to veterans? What can we add, change, or take away?
- Do veterans use the current homepage in favor of My VA? Would veterans prefer that My VA and the VA.gov homepage be one in the logged in experience?
- What have we not considered? What do we not know that we don't know?

4. **Hypothesis: What are your hypotheses for this research?** 

- Veterans will find the existing dashboard to be long and cumbersome. 
- Veterans will report that it is hard to find information and see when it updates.
- Veterans will miss "My VA" because it is not the logged in homepage.
- Veterans will prefer that information be organized by benefit instead of by content type or process.
- Veterans will want to see the status of all benefits they have, including ones we do not currently have access to.
- Veterans may mention that they want some sort of eligibility calculator or recommender.

## Method
1.	**What method of research are you planning?** 

I am planning on doing a guided interview with the existing dashboard as a conversation tool. I will be asking questions about how participants use the current dashboard, what works well for them, and how they think it could be improved. We will also be talking about how they prefer to find, track, and manage their benefits whether that takes place on the dashboard or not.
  
2.	**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?** 

We know that the existing dashboard needs to be improved, and it wouldn't be productive to run strict usability testing because we are planning sweeping changes, not minor usability updates. A structured/guided interview is the best format for this research because it allows for both open conversation and discussion around the existing dashboard. We will be able to learn about veterans' existing and preferred flows for managing benefits while also learning from the existing dashboard design.

3.	**Where are you planning to do your research?**

Remotely, via GTM.

4.	**What will you be testing?**

The existing dashboard.

## Participants and Recruitment

1.	**Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

We need **7** participants (please recruit 7 and only 7, not 9) who meet the following criteria:

- People who use VA.gov. 
- People who are LOA3.
- People who use the My VA dashboard on VA.gov at least 1X/month (more OK). 
- People who receive at least one benefit from the VA.

We would also like at least one participant that is:

- A woman.
- A person of color.
- Under 40.

2.	**What is your recruitment strategy?**

We plan to work with Perigean to recruit for this research study.

## When? 

1.	**Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?** 

We would like to conduct research the week of **July 8 – 12**.

2.	**Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?**

Since we are talking about the existing My VA dashboard, there is nothing to prepare besides the conversation guide.

3. **Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?**

45 – 60 minutes. Please schedule 30 minutes in between.

4.	**Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. 

- **Monday, July 8**: 9:00 am – 5:00 pm
- **Tuesday, July 9**: 9:00 am – 2:45 pm
- **Wednesday, July 10**: 9:00 am – 1:45 pm; 3:00 pm – 5:00 pm
- **Thursday, July 11**: 9:00 am – 11:45 am; 2:00 pm – 4:00 pm
- **Friday, July 12**: 9:00 am – 4:30 pm

5.	**Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?**

Two days before research sessions begin.
