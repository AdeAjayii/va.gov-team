### Project-specific setup

- Be prepared to screenshare and pass keyboard and mouse controls.

## Intro (2 minutes)

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Samara and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your service member to veteran transition. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 – 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you've had a frustrating experience or find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the VA experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** For this session, I will ask you to show us how you complete some tasks. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, and just so you know, we delete these recordings a few weeks after the session. Do you have any questions about this? Are you ok if we record today?

## Warm-up Questions (2 minutes)

OK,let's get started.

2. Of these, what are the most important issues/challenges you're facing?
3. Have you been able to start addressing [these issues]? If so, how are you going about addressing them, or how might you address these challenges once you separate?
4. How could the VA help you address these issues/challenges, if at all?
- What is your ideal scenario with how the VA could help you address these issues/challenges?

**Now I want to talk a little bit more about VA benefits.**

1. How high of a priority is getting set up to receive benefits through the VA?

3. Have you started researching these benefits?

5. How can the VA help you answer these questions and concerns?

## Digital/VA.gov (10 – 15 minutes)

Now I'm going to pass you keyboard and mouse controls so I can see how you'd research some of the things we have talked about.

1. Can you show me how you would research [benefits they are interested in] online? **PLEASE RECORD EXACT STEPS THEY TAKE AND WHAT SITES/PAGES THEY GO TO**
2. (If they do not go to VA.gov) We are going to go to VA.gov. Can you show me how you would find this information on VA.gov?
3. Of the pages we just looked at, what could be improved? What went well?
4. Can you tell me what your ideal first time experience online would look like as a service member transitioning to life as a veteran? How could we make this experience as seamless as possible?

Now let's looked at some of the existing logged in pages on VA.gov. *Moderator brings up signed-in version of My VA dashboard.*

1. Take a look over this page. What are your overall impressions?
2. How do you think you, personally, might use this page as a service member who is getting started with the VA for the first time?
3. What information is *not* on here that would be helpful to you as a service member who is getting started with the VA for the first time?
4. In addition to anything we may have already discussed, what would you change about this page to make it something that would help you more easily manage your onboarding experience at the VA?
