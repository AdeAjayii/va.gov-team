# Some best practices to keep in mind

- Aim for between 30-60 cards
- The cards...
     - need to be on the same conceptual level and similar enough for participants to actually be able to sort them int groups
     - be groupable
- For an open card sort, aim to get between 30-50 participants (or more)
