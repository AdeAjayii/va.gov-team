# Research plan for Dragons: Personalization 2.0 card sort

## Goals
1. **What product & team are you doing this research for?**

Dragons/Personalization. This is part of the personalization 2.0 effort.

2. **Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?** 

The MVPs of the My VA dashboard, user profile, and account settings page launched in the spring of 2018. A year in, the dragons team has decided to revisit these personalized products to evaluate what is going well and what can be improved, removed, added, or reorganized. We kicked off discovery for personalization 2.0 with research that explored [veterans' use of the My VA dashboard](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Dashboard%20interviews/Research%20Summary.md) (or lack thereof). We'd like to follow this research by learning more about veterans' mental models for the broader suite of personalized features (eg. personal information, benefit status, notifications, ID verification, etc.), how they would organize and group this information, and where they would expect to find it.

3. **Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?**

- How would veterans group different personalized features?
- What kind of language are veterans expecting to see when it comes to categorizing groups of different features (eg. profile, dashboard, settings, my stuff, etc)?
- How should we organize features that don't currently exist on VA.gov but we expect to exist in the future (eg. notifications or direct deposit info)? 
- Should we organize applications in their own category, or in benefit specific categories?
- Should we combine the existing profile and account settings pages? Do users see any difference between these two pages?
- Should the existing My VA dashboard, user profile, and account settings page all be reorganized into one singular experience instead of three disparate pages?

4. **Hypothesis: What are your hypotheses for this research?** 

- We will find that we want to combine profile and account settings into one section, and potentially the My VA dashboard.
- In a larger personalized section, there will be sub sections that are more granular than singular profile and account settings sub sections.
- Direct deposit should be under a settings page, not a profile.


## Method

1.	**What method of research are you planning?** 

- Open card sort.  
  
2.	**Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?** 

This method will allow us to see how veterans group different kinds of personalized features/functionality and what kind of terminology they use to categorize them without any moderation or interference that might skew the results.

3.	**Where are you planning to do your research?**

- Online, via Optimal Workshop.

4.	**What will you be testing?**

We will provide participants a list of personalized information/features/functionality (eg. Address information, notification preferences, set up 2FA, etc) and ask them to:

- Group information in whatever groupings feel natural.
- Name the groups they've created.

## Participants and Recruitment

1.	**Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?**

We are looking to circulate this to any VA.gov user, or anyone who uses any of the VA properties (eg. MHV and eBenefits).

2.	**What is your recruitment strategy?**

We will either use the MHV newsletter or VA social media to circulate this study.

## When? 

1.	**Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?** 

Ideally, this will be circulated the week of 7/29, but this depends on when the MHV newsletter goes out and/or when VA social media is able to post it.

2.	**Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready?**

The week of July 22.

3. **Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be?**

We estimate it will take participants 15 â€“ 20 minutes to complete the survey.

4.	**Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. 

We will not need to schedule sessions since this research is unmoderated.

5.	**Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?**

N/A

## Team Roles

**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**

N/A since these are unmoderated sessions.
