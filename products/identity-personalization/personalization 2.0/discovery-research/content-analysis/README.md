# Personalization 2.0 Discovery: Content Analysis

### Goals of this analysis

To document the existing content on VA.gov that will/may be affected by personaliztion 2.0 updates. This will note:

- Where pages are located.
- Why we are looking at a page.
- The goals of the existing content.
- The efficacy of the existing content and site structure.
- Problems with the existing content and site structure.
- Next steps.

## [VA.gov homepage](https://www.va.gov/)

![VA.gov homepage](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Content%20analysis/Images/VA.gov%20homepage.png)

### Why we are looking at this page

While the homepage is not part of what most of us think of as the personalized product suite, it may be affected by personalization 2.0 updates.

### The goals of the homepage

- To route users to the most needed pages including top 20 tasks, content hubs, Find a VA location, the crisis line, and Sign In.
- To elevate VA updates.

### Efficacy of content and structure

- Users love the top 20 tasks. In multiple rounds of user testing, we observed participants relying heavily on the homepage to get them around the site.
- The top benefit categories are elevated on the homepage via the content hubs.

### Problems with content and site structure

-  In some ways, users are almost too reliant on the top 20 tasks. To be clear, it is great that people can get where they need to go easily most of the time. However, when there is something they want to do that is not on the homepage, we have [observed in user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Profile/Direct%20Deposit/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Research/Usability%20testing/Research%20Summary.md#we-need-to-make-it-easier-to-find-the-direct-deposit-tool) that people get confused and give up easily.

### Next Steps

- Talk to Andy and team about their visions for the homepage and updates to the navigation.

## [My VA](https://www.va.gov/my-va/)

![My VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Content%20analysis/Images/Dashboard-Updated-All%20Features.png)

### Site location

The My VA dashboard is available to logged in users via the main navigation.

![Main navigation with My VA highlighted](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Content%20analysis/Images/Main%20nav_My%20VA%20highlighted.png)

### Why we are looking at this page

The My VA dashboard is the flagship product in the personalized suite. It is where we house updates users' individual statuses and updates. In the last year and half since this product has launched, the My VA dashboard has quickly become overwhelming and cumbersome, and we need to figure out how to make it more effective and easier to consume.

### The goals of My VA

1. To elevate users' individual statuses and updates.

### Efficacy of content and structure

- Clear headlines and sections.
- Aggregation of useful content, even if it is duplicated elsewhere.

### Problems with content and site structure

Many of these observations are from a recent round of [user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Profile/Direct%20Deposit/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Research/Usability%20testing/Research%20Summary.md#we-need-to-make-it-easier-to-find-the-direct-deposit-tool).

**Getting to My VA**

We don't effectively route people to My VA. There is no incentive to go there over the homepage, and no wayfinding that leads people to believe this is a worthwhile destination. 

**Many of the site links on My VA are duplicated on the homepage**

Links to the following feature on the My VA dashboard are also accessible via the top 20 tasks on the homepage:

1. Apply for VA health care
2. File a claim
3. Claims and appeals status
4. Secure messages
5. Refill prescriptions
6. Schedule a VA appointment
7. Check your post-9/11 GI Bill benefits
8. Get your medical records
9. Download VA letters

**Less status, more router**

We observed that people on VA.gov really just want to get where they need to go. They don't need to see all their statuses on one page. They are happy to have an effective router that gets them to the page with the status and actions they need to take.

This is especially true for MHV users — since you can no longer send secure messages/refill prescriptions via Vets/VA.gov, people just want to get to MHV and they don't need to see their message/prescription info on VA.gov.

**Ineffective use of space**

The dashboard's visual design does not lend itself well to a page that is supposed to be an overview/router. A single column view, large fonts, and large content blocks make it hard to see very much in a single view on a screen.  

### Next Steps

- Talk to Lauren about how health care plans to use the My VA dashboard in the future.
- Explore combining some of this information into a logged in state of the homepage, and/or combining with the existing profile and account.

## [Profile](https://www.va.gov/profile/)

![VA.gov profile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Content%20analysis/Images/Profile-full-Vet360%20fields.png)

### Site location

The profile is available to logged in users via the main navigation:

![Main nav_profile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Content%20analysis/Images/Main%20Nav_Profile.png)

### Why we are looking at this page

The profile is where users can see what personal/contact/military information the VA has on file for them and update that information. Like the My VA dashboard, this project was launched a year and a half ago and it is already hard to figure out how to effectively update this page with new content.

### The goals of the profile

1. To allow users to see what personal/contact/military information the VA has on file for them and to update it.

### Efficacy of content and structure

- The page is easy to scan.
- Groupings under each category make sense.
- It's easy to update contact information, and this information updates in multiple places at the VA, thanks to the Vet360 integration.

### Problems with content and site structure

**Ineffective use of space**

Like the dashboard, the profile's visual design relies on a single column view, large fonts, and large content blocks that make it hard to see very much in a single view on a screen. 

**Profile or Account?**

In [direct deposit user testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Profile/Direct%20Deposit/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Research/Usability%20testing/Research%20Summary.md#results--takeaways), we saw some conflation between the profile and account pages. While doing [comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Comparative%20Analysis/README.md), we saw that Profile and Account can be used interchangably, while Settings is more of a distinct, separate idea. 

TL;DR — we may want to combine the current profile and account pages into one section since these ideas are closely related.

### Next Steps

- Consult card sort results to determine whether we should consider combining the profile and account settings pages into one section.

## [Account Settings](https://www.va.gov/account/)

![VA.gov account settings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Content%20analysis/Images/Account-full-V2.png)

### Site location

The account settings page is available to logged in users via the main navigation:

![Main nav account](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets.gov-team/blob/master/Products/Identity/Personalization/Personalization%202.0/Discovery%20%26%20Research/Content%20analysis/Images/Main%20Nav_Account.png)

### Why we are looking at this page

Account Settings rounds out the personalized suite of products on VA.gov.

### The goals of Account Settings

- To update settings related to identity, security, and sign in.

### Efficacy of content and structure

- Page is short and headings are effective, making it easy to scan.

### Problems with content and site structure

**Settings, but only for sign in**

The labels "Account" and "Settings" imply that there will multiple kinds of controls that affect the experience across the user's account. However, right now, there really is only settings for sign in, identity verification, and 2FA, so this is more of a Sign in Settings page than an Account Settings page. It makes it hard to figure out how we'd grow this page/section.

**There are no editable settings**

This page only links out to other places where you can update settings. This isn't inherently bad, but it does make it hard to figure out how other settings, eg. notification preferences, might fit into a page like this, and it makes us reliant on the profile for feature additions that could just as easily belong on an account settings page in a user's mind (eg. direct deposit; notifications).

**Profile or Account?**

As mentioned earlier, the line between "Profile" and "Account" is unclear, which is especially problematic in the navigation.

### Next Steps

- Consult card sort results to determine whether we should consider combining the profile and account settings pages into one section.
