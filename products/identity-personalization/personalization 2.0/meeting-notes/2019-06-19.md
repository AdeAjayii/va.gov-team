### Recommendations

* Conduct one month (2, 2 week sprints) of blue sky discovery, deliverying a rough draft of a generic user experience and list of assumptions/exceptions
* Focus on the ideal user experience rather then what we can do given various known constraints

### Next Steps/Action Items
Finalize approach - benefit vs. topic. Lisa's hypothesis, open for discussion, is that topics will run accross benefits so therefore we should start with benefits.

1. Topics, examples include:
  * Preferences
  * Roles & Permissions
  * Notifications
  * Data Integrity
  * Etc...
2. Benefits
  * Health Care
  * Disability
  * Education
  * Career
  * Etc...
  
Set sprint #1 goals, pending approach finalization.

Individual research personalized dashboard experiences in the marketplace and bring thoughts to upcoming session.  Screenshots are great!
