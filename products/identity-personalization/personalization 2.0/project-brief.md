Checkout the methods and templates provided in the [Discovery Toolkit](DiscoverySprintHowTo.md) and consult the [Research Team](../Research).)
* What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem (bonus points for our personas)?

* What secondary research should we do (google, facebook, internal documents)?
* Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?
* Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?
