# Problem Statements

### What problems are we trying to solve?

* Creating a centralized, modern, and easy to use logged in experience where vets, and others, manage and self-serve all things VA benefits and services related. 

## Samara's thoughts

### What do we need to be able to define so we can create a discovery plan

- What questions we have
- What information we already know
- Resources we already have and need to review
- Subject matter experts we may want to talk to

### What questions do we have?

- What research has already been done? What do we already know?
- What are the main problems veterans are trying to solve?? What are their pain points?
    - LK: Consider other user groups as well
- Who are our other user groups? What are their needs, and what problems are they trying to solve?
    - LK: Do we have an existing set of personas by user type (vet, dependant, caregiver, etc.)?
    - LK: Consider non-healthcare related problems as well.
- What strategy efforts have already been done by our DSVA team? Where do we stand with those strategies, and what can we use to inform personalization strategy?
- For any updates we want to make, who currently owns what?
- What (backend) data do we have access to? What can we get?
    - LK: Less concerned about this to start, don't want to let the data stop us from imagining what a thing might be.  We can strip down and reimagin later!
- What do existing GA metrics tell us? 
    - LK: Of those users who sign-in, how many use MyVA and what do they use?
- What features are on eBenefits that we need to move over? What problems do they solve? What should be kept and what, if anything, should be retired permanently and not moved to VA.gov?ive 
    - LK: Repeat sentiment about not worring about where a feature lives or what the status of those things are.  Let's stay in a creative blue sky mindset to start and worry about where and how later.
- Are there things that we need to digitize that are not already digitized?
- LK: Does the login method impact overall user experience?
- LK: What is the status of eBenefits migration and who is leading it?
- LK: What is the status of MHV transition and who is leading it?
