# Where do we go with personalization and notifications?

## Problems

### There are already alert states, tags, and our new notification state in the design system. 

As a result, we keep coming across teams that are rightly applying the design system to implement a notification/alert.

1.	What kind of uniformity/guidance, if any, is needed or would be helpful from our team?
2.	Do teams actually need to work with us? What kind of cross-team collaboration makes sense?
3.	How can we differentiate between system alerts vs. personally-relevant alerts? Does this actually matter to users?

**Preliminary next steps**: A lot will be clarified after Angela puts together the design documentation on notifications/alerts/tags/whatever. This will show us what our opportunities are so we can create a plan.

### The debt notification now feels like it doesn’t make sense if we aren’t scaling the VANotify integration any time soon.

- [Domo report](https://va-gov.domo.com/page/1167851935?userId=1322887837)
- [GA dashboard for onsite notifications](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/dashboard/MALmun-7S7WXBNKxUrQ39g/a50123418w177519031p184624291/)

According to analytics, far more people are clicking into the debt section of My VA than the onsite notification by a large margin, which is pretty surprising to me. From Jan 1 – Aug 2 2023, `Manage your VA debt` was clicked about 300K times from the debt section vs. about 97K clicks from the onsite notification. This is a large discrepancy even considering that the onsite notification was removed about 77K times over the year. 

**Preliminary next steps**: Talk to the team about this.

### The notification component feels very similar to the now-default white card.

1.	If we update My VA to use white card, does the notification component now feel too similar? 
2.	If we update My VA to use the white card, can we/should we insert notifications/statuses into the cards themselves? If so, does that render our new notification component obsolete?
   
**Preliminary next steps**: Explore implementing the white card design on My VA. Discuss whether or not we think there should be some sort of unification of the white card and the notification style.

### The notification component was designed with the VANotify notification center in mind, so it is unclear to me how anyone else should use this.

1.	If the notification center is not happening any time soon, what do we do with the notification style?
2.	Should we be advising people to use this notification state? If so, for what? How do people know whether to use this or the existing alert states?
3.	Is this component confusing? Maybe the icons aren’t necessary…

**Preliminary next steps**: Talk to the team about this.
