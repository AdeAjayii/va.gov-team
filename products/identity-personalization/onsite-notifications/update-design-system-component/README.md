## Overview

[The onsite notification MVP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/mvp#readme) launched in October 2022. As part of this work, we submitted a new design for a notification to the design system, and it was approved for build. We need to actually build the component now and have it added to the library, then update our onsite-notifications on My VA to use the new component.

## Problems

The current design system does not have a solution for an onsite notification that is not used currently as an alert or warning. 

## User outcomes

### Desired User Outcomes
Create a design that visually stands out from other cards and content on the page so that the user knows it is the most important thing to pay attention to.

### Undesired User Outcomes

## Business outcomes

### Desired Business Outcomes
Design further encourages user interaction with time-sensitive and action-oriented features on the page

### Undesired Business Outcomes

## Measuring success

TBD

## Solution approach
Experimental Design submission: [#1181](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-design-system-documentation/issues/1181)
