## 1. Background

When a notification with `onsite_notification` enabled is triggered, VA Notify will call the `vets-api` for the onsite notification endpoint: `/v0/onsite_notifications` with
  - **template_id**
  - **va_profile_id**

VA.gov is using the VA Notify **template_id** to determine what onsite notifications to display on the site. These **template_ids** are [defined in the `vets-api` repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/config/settings.yml#L333) for both staging and production.

- See Creating Onsite Notifications section of the Technical Overview (need access to `va.gov-team-sensitive` repo): 
https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/onsite_notifications/technical-overview.md#creating-onsite-notifications 

These template IDs are used in the [`Notifications` component](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/personalization/dashboard/components/notifications/Notifications.jsx#L11-L13) on the frontend.

As of February 9th, 2023, there only exists one onsite notification: [`DebtNotification`](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/main/src/applications/personalization/dashboard/components/notifications/DebtNotification.jsx).

## 2. Creating Onsite Notifications

1. Acquire **template_id** of desired notification - to do this, we'll need to coordinate with the VA Notify team (Melanie Jones and Beverly Nelson). **([PM, BE, FE] 1â€“2 days)**
2. Coordinate with the backend developer on the My VA team(Tom Harrison) so they can update the model, controller, and Swagger docs on the `vets-api` repo. **([BE] ~3 days, but consult w Tom)**
3. Create (or extend?) current Notifications component on the `vets-website` repo. 
   - This will require planning and refactoring the current components in order to best scale for additional onsite notifications. **([FE] 8 days, Allison to break this down into smaller tix)**
4. Find all instances of debt notification template_id in `vets-website` and update to include new desired notification template_id **([FE] 2â€“3 days)**
5. In order to test and validate the new onsite notification, we'll need to push to staging (behind feature flag) to connect with the API. **([FE] 1â€“2 days depending on devs who are available for code reviews, [PM, Design] 2â€“3 days for design/PM validation)**
6. Make any copy or design changes after validation **([FE] 1â€“2 days to get it through PR and onto staging)**

**Total estimated LOE:** 18â€“23 days
