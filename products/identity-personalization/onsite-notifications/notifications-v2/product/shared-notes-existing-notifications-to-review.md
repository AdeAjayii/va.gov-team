 We can combine these into the main list, but separating them for now until we have a chance to discuss and consolidate across our team.

1. Do the Appeal decision mailed notifications link to anything? Or is it just a heads-up to look out for the mail?
2. What does "Appeal docketed" mean? What kind of information does this link to, if any?
3. Do the "hearing scheduled" notifications link to information, or include the scheduled date and time?
4. Do the "Postponement of hearing" notifications link to information, or include the scheduled date and time?
5. Do the "Privacy Act request pending" notifications require people to take action? If so, what?
6. What is the "quarterly notification" from BVA?
7. What is the "VSO IHP pending" notification? Does it require people to take action? If so, what?
8. Is the "Withdraw of hearing" notification a confirmation? Also, who withdrew the hearing, the veteran or BVA? Or can that vary?
