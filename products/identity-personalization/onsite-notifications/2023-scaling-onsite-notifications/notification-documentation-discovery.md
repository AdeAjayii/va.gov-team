# Notification documentation discovery

We should take some time to document the different types of notifications/alerts that generally power web products, and whether we are already utilizing those on VA.gov or not. The goal of this work is to start viewing the VA>gov notification landscape more holistically, and to highlight our opportunites and options for expanding on it.

**Notification/alert type examples**

This may not be an exhaustive list, so feel free to add to it.

- System alerts (eg. An alert announcing that a feature is down)
- Event-based notifications (eg. A saved confirmation)
- General, non-personalized announcements
- Personalized notifications (eg. "you have a new debt")
- Personalized indicators (eg. a "2" next to an inbox to indicate 2 new messages)

**Things we'd want to document**

- What is the purpose of this type of notification? 
- When might a user see this type of notification?
- Where might a user see this type of notification?
- Does VA.gov already employ this type of notification? If so, where/how?
  - Note: We don't need to recreate any documentation. Things like system alerts are already really well documented in the design system, so we should link off to existing documentation where it makes sense.

**Things we do NOT need to do**

- We don't need any more documentation on different notification center treatments. We've already captured that.
- We don't need to gather exhaustive examples of treatments and styling. For example, it doesn't necessarily matter whether something appears as a modal, bubble, in-line message etc. What matters is the type of notification and what it's trying to communicate.
