# Onsite Notifications In-take Process

This document serves as an overview of the in-take process (in partnership with VA Notify) for new onsite notifications on My VA.

## General Process

1. Team A comes to VA Notify to work with them on establishing email and/or text notification.
2. Team A works with VA Notify through their existing intake and discovery process.
4. Once Team A's feature reaches the point where the notification is going to be implemented (or it's out of the discovery phase), VA Notify performs an initial "vetting" of the notification (see below) to determine if it's something My VA would want to implement as an onsite notification.
5. VA Notify team shares their findings with the My VA team via a formal slack thread (in accountexp-authexp), further discussion as well in bi-weekly syncs. 
6. If My VA wants to pursue/consider adding the notification as an onsite notification to My VA, then they bring the item into their backlog.


## Vetting Notifications for Onsite Use
_How do we determine if a notification (email or text) should be an onsite notification?_

My VA's top priorities:
- Action items: items that require a veteran to take action in order to advance a process
- Communicate high-priority benefit status/updates that don't necessarily require action

For more details, see [Onsite Notification Criteria](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications#onsite-notification-criteria).

### Questions

1. **Is the notification in question a confirmation or success message?** If yes, not a good candidate for an onsite notification. If no, proceed to question 2.
2. **Is the notification in question personalized to the user? (i.e. it is not a general blast/blanket announcement)** If not, this is not a good candidate for an onsite notification. However, is it actionable? _May still be worth a conversation._ If yes (it is personalized), this is a candidate for onsite notifications.
3. **For the non-personalized, but still actionable, notification in question - is it a high priority status update?** If yes, this is a good candidate for an onsite notification. If not, not a good candidate.
