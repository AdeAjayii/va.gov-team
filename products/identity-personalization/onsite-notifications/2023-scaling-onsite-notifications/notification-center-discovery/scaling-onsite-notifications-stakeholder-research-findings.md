## Research Goals
Since Veterans can apply for and manage their benefits on VA.gov any time after getting out of the military, this work impacts the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from Starting Up and beyond.

Our goals for this stakeholder research study were:

* Gather insights about action items from product owners and identify trends.
* Determine if there's a clear consensus on the vision for notifications on VA.gov.
* Identify any challenges or things to consider that we were not already aware of on the Authenticated Experience team.

## Research Questions
* Have other teams talked to users about how they expect to see notifications or action items represented on VA.gov?
* What relevant studies or data should we reference outside of the authenticated experience team as part of this discovery work?
* What are OCTO stakeholders expectations around how we elevate notifications on VA.gov? How strong are their opinions about the outcome of this work?
* What could make or reak Veteran trust as we scale this feature?
* Are there any important factors to consider that we haven't already addressed in this study?

## Methodology 

We conducted stakeholder interviews via Zoom with OCTO product owners:

* Chris Johnston - Portfolio lead
* Rachel Han, Jen Ecker, Ryan Thurlwell, Matt Hall - Mobile app leads
* Lauren Alexanderson, Kay Lawyer, and Kristen McConnell - Health leads
* Dave Conlon - Sitewide lead
* Matt Self - Benefits lead
* Mikki Northuis - IA/Nav lead
* Chante Lantos-Swett - Account experience and customer support lead
* Martha Wilkes - Accessibility lead
* Matt Dingee - Design lead
* Ray Wang - Platform lead

## Key Findings

1. **OCTO product owners have trust in the Authenticated Experience team to scale this feature.**

2. **Several OCTO leads said we should consider giving the user some control over notifications so as not to lose credibility and trust.** 

3. **Product owners who are on VFS teams have already thought about what types of notifications are most important to surface.**

4. **The "Saved Applications" section is confusing to Veterans.**

5. **A notification center on VA.gov would likely need to support messages as well as notifications in the future.**

6. **Accessibility: My VA is highly accessible to disabled Veterans using assistive technology, but the smallest font is still a little too small for some Veterans.**


## Details of Findings 

**Finding 1**

**OCTO product owners have trust in the Authenticated Experience team to scale this feature.** 


**Finding 2**

**Several OCTO leads said we should consider giving the user some control over notifications so as not to lose credibility and trust.** 


**Finding 3**

**Product owners who are on VFS teams have already thought about what types of notifications are most important to surface.** Some Veterans (4 out of 13) expressed wanting to either reorder the sections or collapse empty sections to suit their needs but the majority did not mind the empty sections or the ordering as it currently is on My VA. Some Veterans even said that they appreciate seeing empty sections to remember that those benefits are available to them or for reassurance of the current state, like having no debt to VA.

> _"- Acknowledgement of application submissions or failures, and steps to take (in this case, users want email notification), "I get that when I submit anything on any website." - Matt Self_

> "- If we had more informative, action-oriented claim statuses, like hey you indicated you had a private medical record to submit, we can't do anything with your claim until we get that document. That to my world's perspective is a MAJOR priority." - Matt Self_

**Finding 4**

**The "Saved Applications" section is confusing to Veterans.** 11 out of 13 participants thought that both submitted and in-progress applications would appear in this section. There was also confusion around the term "applications" and several participants thought of a computer application rather than a benefit application initially.

> _"'Applications' is kind of misleading because when we think of applications, we think of 'apps', like Google Chrome is an app." - P6_

> _"That could be a little confusing. When I first looked at it, I thought about computer apps." - P9_

> _"I don't know if my submitted applications would be here. I guess I'd have to get used to the page because it's new to know if my pending applications would show up here." - P4_


**Finding 5**

**The "Education and Training" section is positioned well on the page and important to have present on My VA, but some of the terminology in the links is unfamiliar to Veterans, and for Veterans who have education benefits, they would like to see dynamic content here about their remaining benefits.**

> _"I'm not familiar with the term [GI Bill Statement of Benefits]. Maybe it's where I could see what benefits I'm getting through the GI bill. I'd want to see what's getting paid to me and what's getting paid to the school, and I don't have any way of doing that." - P2_

> _"I think I still have some GI bill benefits. I would love for it to be here the same way, similar to what you guys are providing here [gestures to Benefits Payments]. This is very good information when I log into my landing page. I don't see why you wouldn't have it here. I've never heard that before though, GI Bill Statement of Benefits. I can guess what it is but I've never heard it before." - P12_


**Finding 6**

**Accessibility: My VA is highly accessible to disabled Veterans using assistive technology, but the smallest font is still a little too small for some Veterans.** The 1 screen reader user that we tested My VA with was able to navigate easily using headings and was able to dive into specific sections and access all links. They had very positive overall feedback about the page. 2 Veterans mentioned that the smallest text on the page was a bit too small and hard to read for users who are older or who have low vision.

> _"I like its simplicity. I understand why this page may be very basic, I don't know how pretty it is. When I use bells and whistles out in the commercial world, they attract people's eye so that's why a lot of pages are aggravating for me but I know why because with screen readers we like industrial stuff that doesn't have a lot of extra stuff. People coming here are probably coming here for a reason. It's not like they have to compete with other retailers so there's probably not a lot of wizz bang." ... "If people would just think about accessibility in the beginning, everything would be so much easier for them and for us. I like this page very much. I wish more web pages were like it." - P7_

> _"The headers are very readable for old tired eyes but it drops off pretty quickly from that to this [points at body text]. I can see it but I have to kind of zoom in and get my trifocals." -P9_

## Additional Insights

* When we asked if anything was missing from My VA, 2 participants mentioned wanting to see information online about mental health services, especially for PTSD. 1 of these participants noticed there were links in the footer of the page for this, and the other said they were not able to find any information about it online. 
  * This finding has been shared in the [DSVA Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C033ZS9E7EW/p1674588384107679) and there are efforts underway to surface mental health services in the main benefits navigation, as well as updating the link to take users to the modernized mental health services page.


## Recommendations

* Rethink the "Saved Applications" section to be more clear that only in-progress applications will show there, and more clear what "applications" are.
    * _Supporting evidence: See finding 4_
* Reconsider the link currently called "Check your GI Bill Statement of Benefits" in the "Education and Training" section, as the term is not familiar to Veterans and is an important link for Veterans using GI bill benefits.
    * _Supporting evidence: See finding 5_
    * At this time, we're not able to show dynamic content in this section for remaining education benefits due to data limitations. Based on the feedback we received in this study, Veterans who are using GI bill benefits would be interested in that feature and it should stay on our radar as a future feature if it becomes feasible.
* As of now, we would not recommend reordering the sections on My VA or allowing for additional customization like moveable modules or collapsible sections, since one of the main goals of this study was to simplify the code logic and come up with an ordering of sections that works best for the _most_ users. We didn't hear any Veterans say the order of sections was impeding on their ability to find information relevant to them. We may want to consider further customization of My VA in the future if we continue to hear similar feedback or see significant changes in analytics.


## Next Steps

We will make design updates according to the recommendations in this research summary, have our FE engineer implement the changes in production, and then test the updates in UAT using a feature flipper in production as we did for this usability study.


## Further research needed

After making changes to the Saved Applications and Education and Training sections, we recommend testing these updates in UAT to determine if there is still any confusion.
