## Research Goals
Since Veterans can apply for and manage their benefits on VA.gov any time after getting out of the military, this work impacts the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from Starting Up and beyond.

Our goals for this stakeholder research study were:

* Gather insights about action items from product owners and identify trends.
* Determine if there's a clear consensus on the vision for notifications on VA.gov.
* Identify any challenges or things to consider that we were not already aware of on the Authenticated Experience team.

## Research Questions
* Have other teams talked to users about how they expect to see notifications or action items represented on VA.gov?
* What relevant studies or data should we reference outside of the authenticated experience team as part of this discovery work?
* What are OCTO stakeholders expectations around how we elevate notifications on VA.gov? How strong are their opinions about the outcome of this work?
* What could make or reak Veteran trust as we scale this feature?
* Are there any important factors to consider that we haven't already addressed in this study?

## Methodology 

We conducted stakeholder interviews via Zoom with OCTO product owners:

* Chris Johnston - Portfolio lead
* Rachel Han, Jen Ecker, Ryan Thurlwell, Matt Hall - Mobile app leads
* Lauren Alexanderson, Kay Lawyer, and Kristen McConnell - Health leads
* Dave Conlon - Sitewide lead
* Matt Self - Benefits lead
* Mikki Northuis - IA/Nav lead
* Chante Lantos-Swett - Account experience and customer support lead
* Martha Wilkes - Accessibility lead
* Matt Dingee - Design lead
* Ray Wang - Platform lead

## Key Findings

1. **OCTO product owners have trust in the Authenticated Experience team to scale this feature.**

2. **Several OCTO leads said we should consider giving the user some control over notifications so as not to lose credibility and trust.** 

3. **Product owners who are on VFS teams have already thought about what types of notifications are most important to surface.**

4. **Finding**

5. **A notification center on VA.gov would likely need to support messages as well as notifications in the future.**

6. **Finding**

> _"- Acknowledgement of application submissions or failures, and steps to take (in this case, users want email notification), "I get that when I submit anything on any website." - Matt Self_

> "- If we had more informative, action-oriented claim statuses, like hey you indicated you had a private medical record to submit, we can't do anything with your claim until we get that document. That to my world's perspective is a MAJOR priority." - Matt Self_
