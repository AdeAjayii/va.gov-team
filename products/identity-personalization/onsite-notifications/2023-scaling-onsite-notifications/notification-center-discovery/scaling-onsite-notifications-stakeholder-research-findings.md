## Research Goals
Since Veterans can apply for and manage their benefits on VA.gov any time after getting out of the military, this work impacts the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from Starting Up and beyond.

Our goals for this stakeholder research study were:

* Gather insights about action items from product owners and identify trends.
* Determine if there's a clear consensus on the vision for notifications on VA.gov.
* Identify any challenges or things to consider that we were not already aware of on the Authenticated Experience team.

## Research Questions
* Have other teams talked to users about how they expect to see notifications or action items represented on VA.gov?
* What relevant studies or data should we reference outside of the authenticated experience team as part of this discovery work?
* What are OCTO stakeholders expectations around how we elevate notifications on VA.gov? How strong are their opinions about the outcome of this work?
* What could make or reak Veteran trust as we scale this feature?
* Are there any important factors to consider that we haven't already addressed in this study?

## Methodology 

We conducted stakeholder interviews via Zoom with OCTO product owners:

* Chris Johnston - Portfolio lead
* Rachel Han, Jen Ecker, Ryan Thurlwell, Matt Hall - Mobile app leads
* Lauren Alexanderson, Kay Lawyer, Kristen McConnell - Health leads
* Dave Conlon - Sitewide lead
* Matt Self - Benefits lead
* Mikki Northuis - IA/Nav lead
* Chante Lantos-Swett - Account experience and customer support lead
* Martha Wilkes - Accessibility lead
* Matt Dingee - Design lead
* Ray Wang - Platform lead

## Key Findings

1. **OCTO product owners have trust in the Authenticated Experience team to scale this feature.**

2. **Several OCTO leads said we should consider giving the user some control over notifications so as not to lose credibility and trust.** 

3. **Product owners for VFS teams have already thought about what types of notifications are most important to surface.**

4. **We heard some common themes about challenges to consider with scaling notifications, like giving users some control so notifications don't become noise, and the need for notifications to talk to each other across any interfaces where they appear.**

5. **A notification center on VA.gov would likely need to support messages as well as notifications in the future.**

## Details of Findings 

**Finding 1**

**OCTO product owners have trust in the Authenticated Experience team to scale this feature.** 


**Finding 2**

**Several OCTO leads said we should consider giving the user some control over notifications so as not to lose credibility and trust.** 


**Finding 3**

**Product owners for VFS teams have already thought about what types of notifications are most important to surface.** Details

> _"The should be acknowledgement of application submissions or failures, and steps to take or what to expect next. I get that when I submit anything on any website." - Matt Self_

> _"If we had more informative, action-oriented claim statuses, like hey you indicated you had a private medical record to submit, we can't do anything with your claim until we get that document. That to my world's perspective is a MAJOR priority." - Matt Self_

> _"Information about appts of any type [should be notifications]: appeals, CMP exams, hearings, anything about where a Veteran is expected to participate actively in a thing in service of moving a claim or decision review forward." - Matt Self_

> _"In the VAMC product, there are 140 VA health care systems which encompasses over 2,000 facilities. The VAMC sites are maintained by public officers in the field. Veterans have the ability to subscribe the government delivery notifications. So if a facility is closed, PAOs (Public affair officers) have the ability to essentially check a box that says, send an email message via gov delivery to all of those Veterans who have subscribed for VA gov delivery updates. ...The hypothesis is that Veterans would want instead of or in addition to email updates, to be able to view this in the authenticated experience or receive an email that funnels them into the authenticated experience. But because it's gov delivery, the management and subscription is all done through the gov delivery interface." - Dave Conlon_

* Matt Dingee has been leading a team who are templatizing form components and digitizing them for VA.gov and they have an email notification through VA Notify that says we received your submission. It might be worth having a record of that on VA.gov.

**Finding 5**

> _"Something we hear from Veterans is 'I wish there was a way for me to see all the times I've been in contact with VA and have that information so I can reference it when I'm talking to a new person.'" - Chante Lantos-Swett_

## Additional Insights

* Chante informed us that the functionality that was poorly implemented with Ask VA will be implemented on VA.gov. This is currently a form where users can submit questions to VA and is integrated with Microsoft Dynamics CRM.
* Luciana manages virtual agent (Chat bot) / main VA 411 number (calling into VA for support) and Chante said we may want to talk to them about any upcoming needs for notifications.
