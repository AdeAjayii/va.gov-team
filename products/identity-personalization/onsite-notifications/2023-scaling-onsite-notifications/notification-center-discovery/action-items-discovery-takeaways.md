# 2023 Scaling On-site Notifications: Action Items Discovery Takeaways

Last updated: March 16, 2023

## Key takeaways from comparative analysis

[Tressa's 2021 action items comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2021-action-items-discovery/action-items-comparative%20analysis.md)

- Study focused primarily on sites in the banking and insurance industries
- > Screenshots were solicited for sites of interest since accounts are required to view the authenticated experience. We primarily requested desktop views.
  - How did they solicit these?
- > It's important to have a way to 'view all' or view an action item log. Most commonly this lived on a separate page.
  - This finding supports a notificatio center of sorts for My VA
- > All approaches (except the checklist approach) utilize either an icon or number to indicate users action/attention is needed.
  - This supports our assumption that the most recognizable UX pattern for notifications is a badge/icon that draws attention.
- It's common for notifications that are time-sensitive to be highlighted multiple times on the same page, such as a "bill due" notification at the top of the page, as well as within the "bill pay" section.
- > Many sites only showed 2-4 notifications at at time, if a user wanted to see all notifications they would need to click 'View all'
  - This tracks with our assumption that 3 or so notifications should be the max before linking users to anther page
- > Language is important when helping users take action - if it's time sensitive then the language needs to be more actionable.
  - This is huge and I tink we could do a better job of it moving forward
