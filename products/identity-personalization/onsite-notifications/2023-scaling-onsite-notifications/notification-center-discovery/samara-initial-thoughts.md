# Samara's pre-maternity leave thoughts

Since I likely won't be here for a good portion of this work, I wanted to get some background/thoughts down so the team can execute while I'm out.

## What we already know

[Tressa conducted some "action items" discovery back in 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2021-action-items-discovery). We should review this and see what we already know.

[Tressa also did usability testing on a potential pattern for the notification center](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2021-action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md). We don't necessarily have to follow this design or the proposed patterns exactly, but we may be able to leverage aspects of this.
