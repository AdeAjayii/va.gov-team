# Samara's pre-maternity leave thoughts

Since I likely won't be here for a good portion of this work, I wanted to get some background/thoughts down so the team can execute while I'm out.

## What we already know

[Tressa conducted some "action items" discovery back in 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2021-action-items-discovery). We should review this and see what we already know.

[Tressa also did usability testing on a potential pattern for the notification center](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2021-action-items-discovery/research/alerts-discovery-research-summary.md). We don't necessarily have to follow this design or the proposed patterns exactly, but we may be able to leverage aspects of this.

## Outstanding questions

### [List of outstanding questions from the scaling onsite notifications initiative outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2023-scaling-onsite-notifications#notification-center)

Review this list. Some of these questions might have been answered in Tressa's research; some can likely be answered through new research; some may be just be product things we need to think through.

### Should we add a notification center?

This is probably the question that's hardest to answer, and I'm not 100% sure how we go about answering it.

I think there's enough evidence to continuing to scale onsite notifications in general -- [we've heard repeatedly from years of research that the first thing people want to see when logging in to VA.gov are any necessary action items](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/2021-action-items-discovery#overview). However, whether we add a notification center or how exactly we implement getting action items in front of people is still up for debate (ie. product and design thinking). There is likely room for thinking and maybe even some research around this, but what I can say for sure is that **the way to get at this answer is NOT by usability testing a prototype like Tressa did**. That can answer design specifics, but doesn't get at the larger product questions. I'm not sure how to tackle this right now, but it's something that's top of mind.

### Stakeholder research

Currently, this is where I have the most questions. While obviously we put user needs and insights first, we can't ignore that notifications support all of VA.gov, and that means they support all of the teams that work on VA.gov. While I'm out, I'd like the team to talk to other OCTO stakeholder about their needs and expectations around user-centric notifications on VA.gov.

#### People to talk to 

Pending availability and willingness. I would only book 30 minutes with folks since everyone is super busy.

1. Chris Johnston - Portfolio lead; Currently helping out with the mobile app
2. Lauren Alexanderson - Health lead
3. Dave Conlon - Sitewide lead
4. Matt Self - Benefits lead
5. Mikki Northuis - IA/Nav lead
6. Chante Lantos-Swett - Account experience lead; Also leads customer support work
7. Martha Wilkes - Accessibility lead
8. Ryan Thurlwell - Design lead

#### Questions

All of these are basic starter questions and could probably have a lot of follow-up, so I'd be prepared to have opener question and then see where each conversation goes.

1. What are their expectations around action-item/user-centric notifications on VA.gov? 
2. Have they talked to users about notifications? What have they learned? What are their users' needs/expectations?
3. Where do they expect notifications to be accessible from on VA.gov?
4. To gauge, but maybe not ask outright -- what is their level of comfort with some type of notification functionality showing in the navigation?

### Next steps

1. Thoroughly review Tressa's research.
2. Determine if there are **high-level** outstanding questions we still have, or anything we want to update from Tressa's research.
3. Start stakeholder interview planning.
4. Schedule/hold/summarize stakeholder interviews.
5. Determine where we go from here.
