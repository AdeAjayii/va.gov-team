# Conversation Guide for Authenticated Experience, Scaling Onsite Notifications Stakeholder Research 2023

## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! I'm Angela and I am the designer and researcher for the Authenticated Experience My VA team. We also have (attendees) with us here from the Authenticated Experience team. As you probably know, we're here today because we're doing some high-level discovery to scale the notifications feature on VA.gov, and we'd like to learn about your perspective on this work. 

## Background
1. First, could you tell me about your role and what you do in your work on VFS?
2. How long have you been in this role?
3. Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

## Scaling Onsite Notifications (All)
1. How familiar are you with the current state of onsite notifications on My VA? (If necessary) *Screen share and explain the current debt notification and integration with VA Notify.*
2. I'm curious if you know of any studies your team has conducted where they've heard feedback from users about how they expect to see notifications or action items represented on VA.gov. Does anything come to mind that we might want to reference as part of this work?
3. Do you have any expectations or opinions around how we elevate notifications on VA.gov that you'd like to share? *(Can skip this question if there is a more practice-specific question along the same lines below.)*

## Practice-specific

### Chris Johnston - Portfolio lead
- How does scaling the notifications feature on VA.gov align with the overall VA.gov vision (if at all)? 
- We try to work closely with the mobile app team to align on features and language when we make updates to the authenticated experience on VA.gov since the two are so closely related. Do you have any thoughts about the correlation between VA.gov notifications and the mobile app?

### Rachel Han - Mobile app lead
- What is your overall vision for how the mobile app and the logged in experience on VA.gov should be alike and different?
- We try to work closely with the mobile app team to align on features and language when we make updates to the authenticated experience on VA.gov since the two are so closely related. Do you have any thoughts about the correlation between VA.gov notifications and the mobile app?

### Lauren Alexanderson, Coulton Bunney, and Patrick Bateman - Health portfolio
- Are there any timelines for the My HealtheVet to VA.gov transition that we should be aware of? 
- As your team moves My HeatheVet functionality over to VA.gov, what opportunities do you see to use notifications to elevate that work?

### Dave Conlon - Sitewide lead
- Do you have thoughts about how we might want to consider surfacing notifications within the logged in experience?
- We know you've talked with Samara before about notifications that are in the gray space between general and personalized, like if a user's VAMC was closed for emergency purposes, for example. Do you have any thoughts to share about those types of notifications?

### Matt Self - Benefits lead
- How do you see notifications on VA.gov elevating the benefits work that your teams are doing?
- Are there opportunities to surface important benefit notifications that you're particularly interested in putting on our roadmap, even if they're not immediately technically feasible?

### Mikki Northuis - IA/Nav lead
- Do you have thoughts about how we might want to consider surfacing notifications within the logged in experience?
- What IA timelines should we be aware of that will impact the overall VA.gov navigation?

### Chante Lantos-Swett - Account experience and customer support lead
- Are there customer support issues that you see an opportunity to alleviate with the use of notifications on VA.gov?

### Martha Wilkes - Accessibility lead
- Is there any advice you have about the most accessible approach to notification patterns? Have you seen any sites that are doing it particularly well?
- Is there anything we should do differently than we typically do to engage with a11y folks early and often as part of this work?

### Matt Dingee - Design lead
- What thoughts or concerns do you have about the representation of notifications on VA.gov as we scale this feature?

### Ray Wang - Platform lead
- 

## Challenges (All)

There are some challenges we can already foresee with scaling onsite notifications.
1. Since the feature currently integrates with VA Notify, we can only present notifications that are supported by VA Notify. If users don't see common notifications in a notification center yet because VA Notify does not yet support them (eg. new message from your doctor, or a prescription shipping), what are your thoughts about whether users will trust the feature?
2. Can you think of any important factors to consider or potential challenges that we haven't already disussed today?
