# Conversation Guide for Authenticated Experience, Scaling Onsite Notifications Stakeholder Research 2023

## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! I'm Angela I am the desigbner and researcher for the authenticated experience My VA team. We also have (attendees) with us here from the Authenticated Experience team. As you probably know, we're here today because we're doing some high-level discovery work to scale the notifications feature on VA.gov, and we'd like to learn about your perspective on this work. 

## Background
1. Tell me about your role and what you do in your work on VA.gov.
2. How long have you been in this role?
3. Who are the people and teams you work most closely with?

## Scaling Onsite Notifications (All)
1. How familiar are you with the current state of onsite notifications on My VA? (If necessary) *Screen share and explain the current debt notification and integration with VA Notify.*
2. I'm curious if you know of any studies your team has conducted where they've heard feedback from users about how they expect to see notifications or action items represented on VA.gov. Does anything come to mind that we might want to reference as part of this work?
3. Do you have any expectations or opinions around how we elevate notifications on VA.gov that you'd like to share?

## Challenges (All)

There are some challenges we can already foresee with scaling onsite notifications.
1. Since the feature currently integrates with VA Notify, we can only present notifications that are supported by VA Notify. If users don't see common notifications in a notification center yet because VA Notify does not yet support them (eg. new message from your doctor, or a prescription shipping), what are your thoughts about whether users will trust the feature?
2. Can you think of any important factors to consider or potential challenges that we haven't already disussed today?
