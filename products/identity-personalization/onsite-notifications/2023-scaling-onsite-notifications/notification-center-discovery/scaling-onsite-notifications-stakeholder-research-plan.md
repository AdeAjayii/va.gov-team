# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, Scaling Onsite Notifications Stakeholder Research 2023

## Background
The [onsite notification MVP](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/mvp#readme) launched in October 2022. This functionality does the following:

- Integrates VA.gov and VANotify, so that VA Notify can tell VA.gov when to show an on-site alert to a user.
- Elevates a single, action-oriented alert on My VA for when a user has had a new debt added to their account. Users can click for more information or dismiss the alert.

Now that we've established the initial infrastructure for VA.gov to leverage VA Notify's functionality, we are ready to determine next steps for scaling this feature.

### OCTO Objectives 

Scaling onsite notifications will ensure that logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features. By surfacing the most important updates and action items upon login, we can increase usage of digital, self-service tools and decrease call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution. Accomplishing these things will fulfill our north star objective of being a single, authoritative source of information that is personalized to the logged in user.

### Veteran Journey
Since Veterans can apply for and manage their benefits on VA.gov any time after getting out of the military, this work impacts the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from Starting Up and beyond.
