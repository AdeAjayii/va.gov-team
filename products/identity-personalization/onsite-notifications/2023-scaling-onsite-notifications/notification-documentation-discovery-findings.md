## Research Goals
The goal of this work was to start viewing the VA.gov notification landscape more holistically and to highlight opportunites for expanding on it.

This research supported this goal by:

* Documenting the different types of notifications/alerts that commonly power web products
* Documenting whether we are already utilizing those on VA.gov or not
* Doing discovery work to look into other popular design systems and how they utilize notifications and alerts.
* Identifying opportunities worth exploring for VA.gov found in this discovery research
