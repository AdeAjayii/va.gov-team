## Research Goals
The goal of this work was to start viewing the VA.gov notification landscape more holistically and to highlight opportunites for expanding on it.

This research supported this goal by:

* Documenting the different types of notifications/alerts that commonly power web products
* Documenting whether we are already utilizing those on VA.gov or not
* Doing discovery work to look into other popular design systems and how they utilize notifications and alerts.
* Identifying opportunities worth exploring for VA.gov found in this discovery research

## Types of notifications we're already using and don't see an opportunity to expand upon

## Key Findings

1. **All participants had positive reactions to seeing My VA immediately upon login.**

2. **My VA encompasses all top tasks for Veterans.** 

3. **Veterans generally don't mind seeing empty sections on My VA and some find them helpful to have on the page.**

4. **The "Saved Applications" section is confusing to Veterans.**

5. **The "Education and Training" section is positioned well on the page and important to have present on My VA, but some of the terminology in the links is unfamiliar to Veterans, and for Veterans who have education benefits, they would like to see dynamic content here about their remaining benefits.**

6. **Accessibility: My VA is highly accessible to disabled Veterans using assistive technology, but the smallest font is still a little too small for some Veterans.**


## Additional Insights


## Next Steps

We will make design updates according to the recommendations in this research summary, have our FE engineer implement the changes in production, and then test the updates in UAT using a feature flipper in production as we did for this usability study.


## Further research needed

After making changes to the Saved Applications and Education and Training sections, we recommend testing these updates in UAT to determine if there is still any confusion.
