Background
----------

The[  Personalization 2.0 research conducted in July 2019](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/dashboard-interviews/research-summary.md) revealed that we need to revisit both My VA and the logged-in homepage.  When the new VA.gov launched in 2018, what was a personalized dashboard on Vets.gov became My VA and moved to a different location. A Veteran's logged-in homepage remained the same as the logged-out homepage. As time passed, My VA grew but didn't scale due to the structure set by the MVP. Additionally, the logged in homepage and My VA compete for attention and focus because they are redundant.

[We have proposed consolidating these two pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md#key-takeaway-we-need-to-revisit-our-my-va-logged-in-homepage-approach) by getting rid of My VA, and treating the logged-in homepage as a user's personalized landing pad and router. We did this research to guide our approach, and better understand user and stakeholder needs for a redesigned logged-in homepage.

Discovery Goals
---------------

We hoped to be able to answer the following questions after completing our discovery activities:

-   Why do people come to va.gov? What do they do on va.gov?

-   How might their experience be improved with an improved logged in experience and status updates/notifications?

-   Which tasks are Veterans completing on other VA websites (e.g. eBenefits)?

-   What are other websites and apps doing for logged in homepages and status updates/notifications?

-   How are teams other than Authenticated Experience impacted by an improved logged in homepage experience?

-   What risks do we need to be aware of?

Key findings
------------

### People want a task-based logged-in homepage tailored to them.

When asked to create the page that would be most useful for them to see when they log in, all Veterans in[  our user sessions created a task-based homepage](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-want-a-page-that-is-focused-on-current-information-specific-to-them-rather-than-generalized-information-for-all-veterans). They knew exactly what they needed to manage their experience with the VA. When asked about the current logged-in homepage experience, Veterans described links and content that isn't relevant to them as clutter and noise. 

(look for more specific quote)

"Don't toot your horn on my page. Let me take care of my stuff, and I can get out of there."

The pages our users created:

-   Gave them access to their most important tasks in one place

-   Provided them with important updates

-   Guided them to benefit information and recommendations

-   Minimized content that wasn't specific to them

Stakeholders described this type of task-based, personalized experience as[  one of their goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/stakeholder-interviews/stakeholder-interview-synthesis.md#stakeholder-goals) during our interviews. We also saw this standard set in our[  comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#site-examples), in which every private sector site we looked at anchored their logged-in experiences in a dashboard and navigation that was different from their logged-out marketing sites.  Analytics also confirm that[  logged-in users are very task oriented compared to logged-out users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#logged-in-vs-logged-out-why-do-people-come-to-the-site-what-do-they-do-here).

Implications

1.  We should focus the logged-in homepage on helping Veterans complete tasks as directly as possible (not linking them through multiple content pages to get to where they want to go).

2.  We should minimize content on the logged-in homepage that is not specific to the user.

3.  We should leverage data to intelligently provide users with benefit recommendations and guide them to information about benefits they don't have.

### Health care and disability are king.

The pages created in our user sessions, and[  the findings from brand consolidation research conducted in 2018](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation) tell us these benefit areas are the most important to Veterans.  Our page view analytics support this as well:  the[  claim status tool is the most popular tool](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#on-the-modernized-site-vagov-the-claim-status-tool-is-king) on VA.gov (~60MM views between April 2019 and April 2020), and[  MyHealtheVet's homepage got ~145MM views](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#in-the-non-modernized-data-vagov-plus-mhv-ebenefits-etc-we-can-see-just-how-important-health-care-management-is-to-the-veteran-population) in the same period. VA.gov's homepage got ~23MM views.

Emphasizing these over other tasks makes sense because these benefits require more management and active engagement (e.g. regularly ordering medication, checking for updates on a claim) when compared to other benefits such as education.

Implications: 

1.  The logged-in homepage should prioritize benefit information associated with health(e.g. secure messaging, appointment management, and prescription management) and disability (e.g. rated disabilities, claim status tool, and benefit letters). A more detailed list of items participants prioritized in our research study is [outlined in our findings summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-are-primarily-interested-in-completing-healthcare-and-disability-related-tasks-such-as-messaging-ordering-medication-and-checking-claim-status).

2.  We should provide users with direct ways to complete health and disability tasks.

### Veterans care about anything they have in flight, whether that is education or other benefits.

Participants in our research study demonstrated that Veterans want to see information about any of their active benefits.  Education benefits were most common outside of health and disability; we also saw this as a priority in the[  2018 brand consolidation research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation).  In our sessions, participants were particularly[  interested in seeing GI Bill balance and payment information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important) on their homepage.  They also brought up VA home loans and life insurance as current benefits that they had recently looked up on VA.gov during a logged-in session.

Page views further underscore the importance of education information for logged-in users,[  with ~4MM for the GI Bill statement of benefits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#logged-in-users-are-more-interested-in-checking-the-status-of-their-benefits-or-accessing-their-records) in the last year.

Implications: 

1.  Information outside of the high-priority health and disability categories are important to users, especially around education benefits.

2.  GI Bill balance and payment info is particularly important to those with education benefits.

3.  We need to account for all in-flight items a user may have on the logged-in homepage.

### Records and documents are a focus for Veterans.

All participants in our research study had[  something on their homepage related to documents or records](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#easy-access-to-documents-from-the-homepage-was-important-for-participants), and many named downloading or looking for a document as the most recent task they had completed on VA.gov.  This validated what we saw in the brand consolidation research where[  records were listed as a priority](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation) for Veterans along with benefit information. The[  benefit planning, applications, and claims research conducted by Frog in 2016](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/4446518/D5_frog_VCRD_ResearchReadout_final.pdf) details how critical records are to Veterans who are filing disability claims (see page 48), and a Veteran in our study supported this when explaining why easy access to documents mattered to them:

"When you leave the military, you learn real quickly if you don't have it, it doesn't exist. So you want to keep it no matter what in case there are errors or something happens, you cover yourself."

Analytics show us[  huge numbers of page views for downloading personal records](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#claims-va-letters-and-profile-information-are-all-popular-next-steps-from-my-va)  (Blue button ~12.5MM; MHV's "Download My Data" tool ~8.8MM), and that[  downloading VA benefit letters is a popular next step from My VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#claims-va-letters-and-profile-information-are-all-popular-next-steps-from-my-va). We also see[  high numbers of search terms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#people-are-searching-for-general-health-and-benefit-information-forms-and-some-specific-tasks-we-may-want-to-do-a-better-job-of-elevating) for items participants in our study placed on their logged-in homepage such as their certificate of eligibility or DD214.

Implications

1.  Veterans would likely find a dedicated space for records and documents helpful.

2.  We should create more direct access to records and documents in the logged-in experience, whether that is from the homepage or further elevating these items in a logged-in navigation.

### The logged-in homepage needs to scale to support every phase of the Veteran lifecycle.

Our[  Veteran journey maps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#journey-maps) help us understand how Veteran's needs change throughout their life, and illustrate how important it is that our design can adapt to meet these changes.  The personalized pages created in our study ([screenshots in GH repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/session-notes)) drive this point home; each homepage created was unique in terms of exactly what and how much content there was.

Multiple participants had recently visited VA.gov to[  learn more about benefits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-were-interested-in-benefit-recommendations-and-eligibility-information) (such as Voc Rehab or how dependents could use benefits) and stated that they are interested in broader[ information about the VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-were-interested-in-information-that-helps-them-be-more-involved-with-the-va-as-a-whole-and-take-better-care-of-themselves) and general wellness information. This tells us we need to account for more than tasks on the logged-in homepage.

In the Personalization 2.0 research, we learned about the[  importance of an onboarding experience for separating service members](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md#we-need-an-onboarding-experience). This emphasizes how critical it is that our homepage is equally useful for the Veteran who has no benefits to the Veteran with many benefits.

Implications

1.  Our design needs to scale so that users with many benefits can find exactly what they've logged in to do just as easily as users who may have only one or two items on their logged-in homepage.

2.  We need to account for more than just tasks on the logged-in homepage.

3.  The logged-in homepage should still be useful to Veterans who have no updates or benefits by helping them understand what benefits they may be eligible for, and providing clear next steps to receive them.

4.  We need an onboarding experience for separating service members.

### The existing "blue sky" prototype gets a lot of things right.

[Most participants in our study responded positively to the blue sky prototype](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#a-design-like-the-blue-sky-prototype-would-be-useful-to-veterans) and were excited by the possibility that their logged-in homepage could look like that.  The design was easy for them to scan and quickly understand their options.

"Do mine like this...somebody got in my head, this is perfect."

The content prioritization and layout aligns the[  findings from our comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#how-do-sites-organize-different-types-of-content-within-a-single-logged-in-homepagedashboard-view) as well; it emphasizes tasks, provides a summary or snapshot of information, clearly communications updates, and links users to more detailed information.

Participants also liked that the blue sky prototype gave them an overview of all content available within the dashboard through the sidebar navigation, and found the recommendations and local information helpful.

Implications

1.  The Blue Sky prototype's design and balance of information would meet user expectations set by the private sector.

2.  Using this pattern as a starting point would save design time and allow us to ramp up more quickly than if we start from scratch.

### Veterans expect a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks from their homepage.

When designing their own page,[  participants expected a variety of ways to complete their tasks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-expect-a-mix-of-links-and-widgets-to-complete-tasks-on-their-homepage-and-want-clear-labels-to-understand-next-steps). The majority of participants created links from their personalized page for more detailed tasks like reviewing records. For straightforward tasks like refilling a prescription or scheduling an appointment, participants described completing the task right on their page. We can also see across[  examples from the comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#site-examples) that providing a mix of links and widgets is a common practice for task-based dashboards.

Participants specifically referenced design patterns, such as dropdown menus, that would be helpful to them to get to tasks. This demonstrates that[  what the private sector is doing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#what-appears-as-a-widget-vs-text-link-vs-something-else) to route users from a logged-in dashboard has influenced user expectations.

Implications

1.  There isn't a single "link or widget" solution that will be most useful to complete tasks.

2.  The complexity of the task and depth of information available around a particular item should drive our design decisions and ensure we properly shift focus on the task at hand. For example, consider using a widget for a straightforward task like refilling a prescription, and a link for more detailed tasks like reviewing medical records.

3.  Using common practices from the private sector to inform our designs may help users more easily adapt to the new design.

### The homepage needs to be supported by a cohesive logged-in navigation.

Veterans found the sidebar navigation in the blue sky prototype helpful, because it provided them with an overview of all available content. The variety of tools and depth of information that logged-in users are interested in tells us we must have a logged-in navigation to help ground their experience as they move through the site. We can infer from the prevalence of an[  authenticated navigation in our comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#how-does-an-authenticated-toolbarmenu-fit-into-the-overall-site-navigation) that this is a successful approach in the private sector and a logged-in navigation will meet user expectations.

During stakeholder interviews[  our current navigation came up as being problematic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/stakeholder-interviews/stakeholder-interview-synthesis.md#perceived-problems-with-the-current-ux) in two ways:

1.  It doesn't change once you're logged in, which gives little sense of personalization.

2.  We're not effectively guiding logged-in Veterans with our navigation; the multitude of options require significant cognitive load for the user to sort through and find the task they actually came to complete.

Analytics also provides a couple of interesting insights to inform our approach to navigation.  First, we see that[  logged-in users are primarily interested in tools](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#logged-in-users-are-more-interested-in-checking-the-status-of-their-benefits-or-accessing-their-records) on the modernized VA.gov (with 7 tools in the top 25 pages and only 3 "explore/apply" pages).  We also know that[  users reorient themselves on the homepage](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#most-people-start-directly-on-the-homepage-but-some-people-reorient-themselves-their-throughout-their-session) throughout their session. Both of these suggest that a tool/task based navigation would benefit users by providing them consistent and easy access to the items that matter most to them.

Implications

1.  Providing a logged-in navigation focused on tasks and tools would help users more efficiently move through VA.gov and complete their tasks.

2.  A logged-in navigation will help users feel grounded and provide a more seamless experience as they explore various content.

3.  We will need to collaborate and coordinate with IA and Public Websites on a navigation strategy.

### Veterans want new information to be clear to them when they log in, and expect to receive new information through multiple channels.

Veterans placed[  updates and notifications near the top of the personalized page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-typically-look-for-notifications-in-the-top-portion-of-a-page-but-expect-notifications-from-the-va-outside-of-their-logged-in-experience) they created in almost all sessions, which tells us it is important to them that this information is clear. One participant went so far as to say they wanted it in a big red bulls-eye in the middle of their page so they couldn't miss it.

In our comparative analysis, we saw[  new information displayed in the top portion](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#how-are-sites-implementing-alerts-and-notifications) of the logged-in homepage, oftentimes in a dedicated notification center.  Some examples also included in-line notifications, to which Veterans responded positively when reviewing our blue sky prototype.

The user interviews also revealed that Veterans have come to expect important communication from the VA through a phone call, the mail, or an email; we need to be mindful of the various channels of communication a Veteran is exposed to.

Implications

1.  Veterans will find notifications on the logged-in homepage helpful, and will typically look for them somewhere at the top of the page.

2.  It will be worth exploring in-line notifications as well (similar to what is on the Claims card in the blue sky prototype dashboard), and testing different approaches with users.

3.  Since Veterans are so used to email, mail and phone calls from the VA, we shouldn't rely strictly on logged-in homepage notifications to communicate important information to Veterans in the initial roll-out of the new design.
