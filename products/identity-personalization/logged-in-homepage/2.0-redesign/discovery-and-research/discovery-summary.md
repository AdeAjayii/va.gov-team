Background
----------

Based on the [2019 Personalization 2.0 strategy](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md), the Authenticated Experience team is pursuing a redesign of the existing logged-in homepage on VA.gov. This will involve retiring the current My VA dashboard and bringing people’s personal information right to their homepage.

[We have proposed consolidating these two pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md#key-takeaway-we-need-to-revisit-our-my-va-logged-in-homepage-approach) by getting rid of My VA, and treating the logged-in homepage as a user's personalized landing pad and router. We did this research to guide our approach, and better understand user and stakeholder needs for a redesigned logged-in homepage.

We hoped to be able to answer the following questions after completing our discovery:

-   Why do people come to VA.gov? What do they do on VA.gov?
-   How might their experience be improved with an updated logged-in homepage and status updates/notifications?
-   Which tasks are Veterans completing on other VA websites (e.g. eBenefits)?
-   What are other websites and apps doing for logged in homepages and status updates/notifications?
-   How are teams other than Authenticated Experience affected by an improved logged in homepage experience?
-   What risks do we need to be aware of?

We completed the following research activities to answer our questions:

- [DEPO Stakeholder interviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/stakeholder-interviews/stakeholder-interview-synthesis.md)
- [Review of VA.gov analytics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md)
- [Review of previous research studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md)

Key findings
------------

### People want a task-based logged-in homepage tailored to them.

We conducted user research in which we asked participants to create the page they wanted to see when they logged in. One thing was clear in these sessions — [Veterans want a task-based, personalized homepage](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-want-a-page-that-is-focused-on-current-information-specific-to-them-rather-than-generalized-information-for-all-veterans). The pages they created demonstrated they knew exactly what they needed to manage their experience with the VA. When asked about the current logged-in homepage experience, many Veterans expressed that they were confused or frustrated by all the links on the logged-in homepage that aren't relevant to them.

>  "Don't toot your horn on my page. Let me take care of my stuff, and I can get out of there."

The pages our users created:

- Gave them access to their most important tasks in one place

- Provided them with important updates

- Guided them to benefit information and recommendations

- Minimized content that wasn't specific to them

  ![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/session-notes/p14.png)

  *Example of a page created in our user session. User created a personalized homepage with dedicated section linking off to other pages (education page shown as example)*.

Stakeholders described this type of task-based, personalized experience as[one of their goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/stakeholder-interviews/stakeholder-interview-synthesis.md#stakeholder-goals) during our interviews. We also saw this standard set in our[comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#site-examples), in which every private-sector site we looked at had a logged-in experience that was tailored and different from their logged-out marketing sites. Analytics also confirm that [logged-in users are very task-oriented compared to logged-out users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#logged-in-vs-logged-out-why-do-people-come-to-the-site-what-do-they-do-here).

**Implications**

1.  We should focus the logged-in homepage on helping Veterans complete tasks as directly as possible (not linking them through multiple content pages to get to where they want to go).

2.  We should minimize content on the logged-in homepage that is not specific to the user.

3.  We should leverage data to intelligently provide users with benefit recommendations and guide them to information about benefits they don't have.

### Health care and disability are king.

Veterans are primarily using VA.gov to manage their health care and the disability claims process. In user research, we saw these items prioritized on the pages participants created. [The findings from brand consolidation research conducted in 2018](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation) also tell us these benefit areas are the most important to Veterans.  Our page view analytics data also support this finding:  the [claim status tool is the most popular tool](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#on-the-modernized-site-vagov-the-claim-status-tool-is-king) on VA.gov (~60MM views between April 2019 and April 2020), and [MyHealtheVet's homepage got ~145MM views](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#in-the-non-modernized-data-vagov-plus-mhv-ebenefits-etc-we-can-see-just-how-important-health-care-management-is-to-the-veteran-population) in the same period. VA.gov's homepage got ~23MM views.

Emphasizing these over other tasks makes sense because these benefits require more management and active engagement (e.g. regularly ordering medication, checking for updates on a claim) when compared to other benefits such as education.

**Implications** 

1.  The logged-in homepage should prioritize benefit information associated with health (e.g. secure messaging, appointment management, and prescription management) and disability (e.g. rated disabilities, claim status tool, and benefit letters). A more detailed list of items participants prioritized in our research study is [outlined in the summary of our findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-are-primarily-interested-in-completing-healthcare-and-disability-related-tasks-such-as-messaging-ordering-medication-and-checking-claim-status).

2.  We should provide users a way to complete health and disability tasks as directly as possible from their logged-in homepage, whether that means allowing them to complete those tasks directly on the page, or minimizing the number of pages they need to go through before getting to their task.

### Veterans care about anything they have in flight, whether that is education or other benefits.

Participants in our research study demonstrated that Veterans want to see information about any of their active benefits.  Education benefits were most common outside of health and disability; we also saw this as a priority in the[  2018 brand consolidation research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation).  In our sessions, participants were particularly[  interested in seeing GI Bill balance and payment information](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#for-those-interested-in-education-benefits-gi-bill-balance-and-payment-information-was-most-important) on their homepage.  They also brought up VA home loans and life insurance as current benefits that they had recently looked up on VA.gov during a logged-in session.

Page views further underscore the importance of education information for logged-in users,[  with ~4MM for the GI Bill statement of benefits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#logged-in-users-are-more-interested-in-checking-the-status-of-their-benefits-or-accessing-their-records) in the last year.

**Implication:** We need to account for all in-flight items a user may have on the logged-in homepage.

### Records and documents are a focus for Veterans.

All participants in our research study had [something on their homepage related to documents or records](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#easy-access-to-documents-from-the-homepage-was-important-for-participants), and many named downloading or looking for a document as the most recent task they had completed on VA.gov.  This validated what we saw in the brand consolidation research where [records were listed as a priority](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation) for Veterans along with benefit information. The [benefit planning, applications, and claims research conducted by Frog in 2016](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/files/4446518/D5_frog_VCRD_ResearchReadout_final.pdf) details how critical records are to Veterans who are filing disability claims (see page 48), and a Veteran in our study supported this when explaining why easy access to documents mattered to them:

> "When you leave the military, you learn real quickly if you don't have it, it doesn't exist. So you want to keep it no matter what in case there are errors or something happens, you cover yourself."

Analytics show us [huge numbers of page views for downloading personal records](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#claims-va-letters-and-profile-information-are-all-popular-next-steps-from-my-va)  (Blue button ~12.5MM; MHV's "Download My Data" tool ~8.8MM), and that [downloading VA benefit letters is a popular next step from My VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#claims-va-letters-and-profile-information-are-all-popular-next-steps-from-my-va). We also see [high numbers of search terms](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#people-are-searching-for-general-health-and-benefit-information-forms-and-some-specific-tasks-we-may-want-to-do-a-better-job-of-elevating) for items participants in our study placed on their logged-in homepages, such as their certificate of eligibility or DD214.

**Implications**

1.  Veterans would likely find a dedicated space for records and documents helpful.
2.  We should preserve the direct access to records and documents we provide on the logged-in homepage,
3.  We should consider further elevating these items in our authenticated navigation.

### The logged-in homepage needs to scale to support every phase of the Veteran lifecycle.

Our [Veteran journey maps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#journey-maps) help us understand how Veteran's needs change throughout their life, and illustrate how important it is that our design can adapt to meet these changes.  The personalized pages created in our study ([screenshots in GH repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/session-notes)) drive this point home; each homepage created was unique in terms of exactly what and how much content there was.

Multiple participants had recently visited VA.gov to [learn more about benefits](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-were-interested-in-benefit-recommendations-and-eligibility-information) (such as Voc Rehab or how dependents could use benefits) and stated that they are interested in broader [information about the VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-were-interested-in-information-that-helps-them-be-more-involved-with-the-va-as-a-whole-and-take-better-care-of-themselves) that could impact them.  A few participants were also interested in finding general wellness information on their page. This tells us that Veterans trust VA.gov to help them with more than completing tasks related to the benefits they already have.

In the Personalization 2.0 research, we learned about the [importance of an onboarding experience for separating service members](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research/README.md#we-need-an-onboarding-experience). This emphasizes how critical it is that our homepage is equally useful for the Veteran who has no benefits to the Veteran with many benefits.

**Implications**

1.  Our design needs to scale to meet the needs of all Veterans. Those with many benefits should be able to find exactly what they've logged in to do, and Veterans who have no updates or benefits should be able to understand what benefits they may be eligible for, and how to receive them.
2.  We need to account for content that can help Veterans explore new benefits, get updates from the VA, and find broader healthcare information on the logged-in homepage.
3.  We need an onboarding experience for separating service members.

### The existing "blue sky" prototype gets a lot of things right.

[Most participants in our study responded positively to the blue sky prototype](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#a-design-like-the-blue-sky-prototype-would-be-useful-to-veterans) and were excited by the possibility that their logged-in homepage could look like that.  The design was easy for them to scan and quickly understand their options.

> "Do mine like this...somebody got in my head, this is perfect."

The content prioritization and layout aligns the [findings from our comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#how-do-sites-organize-different-types-of-content-within-a-single-logged-in-homepagedashboard-view) as well; it emphasizes tasks, provides a summary or snapshot of information, clearly communications updates, and links users to more detailed information.

Participants also liked that the blue sky prototype gave them an overview of all content available within the dashboard through the sidebar navigation, and found the recommendations and local information helpful.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/images/personalization-blue-sky-dashboard-cropped.png)

*Blue sky prototype shown in our user sessions.*

**Implications**

1.  The Blue Sky prototype's design and balance of information would meet user expectations set by the private sector.

2.  Using this pattern could save design time as we roll out a more mature logged-in homepage.

### Veterans expect a mix of links and widgets to complete tasks from their homepage.

When designing their personalized page, [participants in our research study expected a variety of ways to complete their tasks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-expect-a-mix-of-links-and-widgets-to-complete-tasks-on-their-homepage-and-want-clear-labels-to-understand-next-steps). The majority of participants created links from their page to more detailed tasks like reviewing records. For tasks perceived to be straightforward, such as checking on the status of a claim, or refilling a prescription, participants described completing the task right on their page. We can also see across [examples from the comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#site-examples) that providing a mix of links and widgets is a common practice for task-based dashboards.

Participants in our study referenced specific design patterns, such as dropdown menus, that would be helpful to them to get to tasks. This demonstrates that [the way the private sector is routing users](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#what-appears-as-a-widget-vs-text-link-vs-something-else) from a logged-in dashboard has influenced user expectations.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/session-notes/p9.png)

*Example of page created by participant in our session who created dropdown menus inspired by their banking experience.*

**Implications**

1.  The complexity of the task should drive design decisions so that we can properly shift focus to the task at hand; there isn't a single "link or widget" solution that will work across the board.  For example, we should consider using a widget for what Veterans perceive to be a straightforward task like refilling a prescription, and a link for more detailed tasks like reviewing medical records.

2.  Using common practices from the private sector to inform our designs will be helpful to users as they learn to use their new logged-in homepage.

### The homepage needs to be supported by a cohesive logged-in navigation.

Veterans found the sidebar navigation in the blue sky prototype helpful because it provided them with an overview of all available content. The variety of tools and depth of information that logged-in users are interested in tells us we must have a logged-in navigation to help ground their experience as they move through the site. We can infer from the prevalence of an [authenticated navigation in our comparative analysis](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#how-does-an-authenticated-toolbarmenu-fit-into-the-overall-site-navigation) that this is a successful approach in the private sector and a logged-in navigation will meet user expectations.

During stakeholder interviews [our current navigation came up as being problematic](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/stakeholder-interviews/stakeholder-interview-synthesis.md#perceived-problems-with-the-current-ux) in two ways:

1.  It doesn't change once you're logged in, which gives little sense of personalization.

2.  We're not effectively guiding logged-in Veterans with our navigation; the multitude of options require significant cognitive load for the user to sort through and find the task they need to complete.

Analytics also provides a couple of interesting insights to inform our approach to navigation.  First, we see that [logged-in users are primarily interested in tools](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#logged-in-users-are-more-interested-in-checking-the-status-of-their-benefits-or-accessing-their-records) on the modernized VA.gov (with 7 tools in the top 25 pages and only 3 "explore/apply" pages).  We also know that [users reorient themselves on the homepage](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#most-people-start-directly-on-the-homepage-but-some-people-reorient-themselves-their-throughout-their-session) throughout their session. Both of these suggest that a task-focused navigation would benefit users by providing them consistent and easy access to the items that matter most to them.

**Implications**

1.  We should provide a logged-in navigation that is task-focused to help users more efficiently move through VA.gov, and give them a cohesive experience as they explore various content.	

2.  We will need to collaborate and coordinate with IA and Public Websites on a navigation strategy.

### Veterans want new information to be clear to them when they log in, and expect to receive new information through multiple channels.

We specifically asked Veterans in our user study where or how they would expect to receive notifications and updates about items on the pages they created.  Most said they expect that kind of information to come via a phone call, email, or physical mail, either because that's what they're used to, or because it's the easiest way to reach them.  

Then, we gave the prompt to imagine they could get updates right on their page, and describe how that would look. Veterans placed [updates and notifications near the top of the personalized page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#participants-typically-look-for-notifications-in-the-top-portion-of-a-page-but-expect-notifications-from-the-va-outside-of-their-logged-in-experience) they created, but there wasn't one consistent placement across the sessions.  Despite that lack of consistency, this tells us what is most important is that the information is clear and hard to miss. One participant went so far as to say they wanted it in a big red bulls-eye in the middle of their page so they couldn't miss it.

In our comparative analysis, we saw [new information displayed in the top portion](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/comparative-analysis.md#how-are-sites-implementing-alerts-and-notifications) of the logged-in homepage, often in a dedicated notification center.  Some examples also included notifications within the same block of content as the item in question.  The blue sky prototype we showed Veterans in our study also had this type of in-line notifications, to which they responded positively.

![](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/images/personalization-blue-sky-dashboard-notification.png)

*Detail of in-line notification style shown in blue sky prototype.*

**Implications**

1.  Veterans will find notifications on the logged-in homepage helpful, and will typically look for them somewhere at the top of the page.
2.  We should test different approaches to notification placement, including a dedicated Notification center, alert-style banners at the top of the page, and notifications in-line with the item in question (as seen on the Claims section in the blue sky prototype).
3.  Since Veterans are used to email, mail, and phone calls from the VA, we need to consider the various channels of communication Veterans receive from the VA as we mature the notifications we provide through an authenticated experience.

## Moving forward

### Approaching the logged-in homepage redesign iteratively

[In stakeholder interviews](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/stakeholder-interviews/stakeholder-interview-synthesis.md#perceived-project-risks), one of the main concerns raised was that a logged-in homepage redesign could easily suffer from endless churn. In order to avoid this, we have outlined an initial approach to scope the project into manageable pieces.

First, we'll break this work into three projects:

- The logged-in homepage redesign.
- Creation of a logged-in navigation.
- Creation of a notification center.

We'll work on the logged-in homepage redesign first. As time and resources allow, work on the logged-in navigation (in partnership with the IA and public websites teams) and notification center.

For the logged-in homepage redesign, we'll break the project into at least three phases:

- **Phase 1**: Transfer the personalized information currently on My VA (in progress-application and claims; benefit info) to the logged-in homepage; Retire My VA.
- **Phase 2**: Improvements to phase 1; Addition of features if applicable.
- **Phase 3**: Improvements to the first-time user experience; Potential benefit recommendations.
  - Note: We will have a basic first-time user experience in phase 1.

### Developing design patterns for authenticated tools

This project’s success hinges on updating the existing patterns we have in our design system. Currently, patterns cater to unauthenticated content, which has left us with a lengthy and [cluttered mess on My VA](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization%202.0/discovery-research#observations-visual-design). There is a ton of great, personalized information on this page, but it is buried because we don’t currently have patterns that handle this kind of content well. 

Having a scannable dashboard matters — we’ve seen that in the [positive reaction to the blue sky prototype](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/user-research/findings-summary.md#a-design-like-the-blue-sky-prototype-would-be-useful-to-veterans) — so we want to work with the VA platform team to figure out the best way to display authenticated content in a scalable, flexible way.

### Conducting regular user testing 

The existing homepage, created as part of the 2018 redesign, [went through multiple rounds of user testing before launch](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/previous-research-review.md#brand-consolidation). Given the amount of traffic that the new logged-in homepage will get, and that we’ll be changing the [wildly popular top 20 tasks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/analytics/analytics-summary.md#from-the-homepage-people-primarily-navigate-into-the-tools-displayed-in-the-top-20-tasks), we should strive to conduct user testing at more than one point in each phase to make sure we’re getting things right.

### Stakeholder management

While we’re **not** changing anything about the logged-out homepage, we’ll need to review the new logged-in approach with stakeholders both inside and outside of DEPO. In order to not end up in a cycle of endless churn, we plan to:

-	Have a strong strategy based on user research (this document!).
-	Lead with strong recommendations based on user insights and analytics when sharing work.  
-	Be strategic about when and how we engage stakeholders outside of DEPO.

### Measuring the right metrics

We want the new logged-in homepage to be measured in more than page views (which will already be high because it’s the homepage) and link clicks (which are important, but not the whole story). We’re currently figuring out our objectives so we can guide this work accordingly and get the right analytics in place to tell us how we’re doing.

Preliminarily, we are thinking about monitoring:

-	How the logged-in homepage affects conversions for the different tasks it features.
-	How well we guide veterans with no benefits or applications.
-	How/if the new logged-in homepage affects how many people log-in and how often they log-in.

## Immediate next steps

Following this report, we plan to pursue this work as follows:

-	Hand off this work between Liz Lantz (public websites) and the authenticated experience team.
-	Start moving into design planning.
-	Figure out specific next steps for discussing this work with stakeholders outside DEPO.
-	Continue working on OKRs & KPIs and getting analytics set up.
-	Start technical discovery.
-	Start initial phase 1 design iterations.
