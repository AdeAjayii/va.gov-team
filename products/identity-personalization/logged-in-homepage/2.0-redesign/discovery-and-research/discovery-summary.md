Initial thoughts

- Include only the most important insights that feel necesary to bubble up from each individual activities.
- Divide recommendations by UI/design recs and then process/project recs.

**UI recs**

- Emphasize claim status tool and health care tools
  - Most used in analytics
  - May see these as the most important in user testing
  - Health care is the only thing people really manage long term anyway
  - This doesn't mean we may not show other select important statuses (applications in flight, GI bill balance)
- Notifications should be at the top of the page, accessible from anywhere
  - Ubiquitous pattern seen in comparative analysis
  - Most people enter from homepage, but this will make notifications accessible from anywhere
- With what we should put on the dashboard:
  - How much of this is status/"in flight" content (eg. claim status, in progress applications, upcoming appointments)?
  - How much of this is "about me" (eg. disability rating)?
  
**Process**

- Be strategic about involving outside stakeholders
  - To avoid lengthy churn or the page becoming a dumping ground
- Approach the redesign iteratively
  - To avoid analysis paralysis (stakeholder interviews)
  - Because we see in analytics just how reliant people are on the top 20 tasks
  - Because the logged in experience should be a system that works together, and we don't have a specific logged in nav OR notifications OR a logged in homepage. This all needs to work together and we don't want to take forever making it perfect.
- User test, user test, user test.
  - This page is too imporatnt to user test once
  - We saw in our research review that the 2018 homepage was tested at least 6 times to get to the right approach
  - This will also allow us to design with users, build more iteratively, and make meaningful updates
