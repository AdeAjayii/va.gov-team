## Research Goals

This study was conducted as part of a large discovery effort to kick-off the redesign of the logged-in homepage for VA.gov.  Through [research we did in July 2019](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization 2.0/discovery-research/dashboard-interviews/research-summary.md), we determined that it's time to revisit both My VA and the logged in homepage. [We have proposed consolidating these two pages into one](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/personalization 2.0/discovery-research/README.md#key-takeaway-we-need-to-revisit-our-my-va-logged-in-homepage-approach) by getting rid of My VA altogether and treating the logged-in homepage as a user's personalized landing pad and router.

We conducted this study to talk with Veterans to better understand their needs and what would make the  logged-in experience more useful to them inform the next phase of our design work.

## Research Methodology

Description of method chosen

### Who we talked to

We spoke to 10 Veterans:

- 6 women, 4 men
- 5 participants 35-44, 2 participants 45-54, 2 participants 65-74, and 1 did not disclose their age
- 6 Caucasian, 2 African-American, 1 Hispanic, and 1 American Indian or Alaska Native
- 3 participants identified as having cognitive and/or functional disabilities
- 5 participants had completed high school or some college; 5 participants had an Associate's degree or higher
- All had at least one benefit; the majority had 2-3 with disability and health benefits being the most common

### Research Questions

- Why do participants log in to VA.gov?
- What do people think the difference should be between the profile and dashboard/logged-in homepage?
- Should there be a meaningful difference?
- What content do people expect to see in either section?
- What types of notifications do people expect to see?
- Where do people expect to see/receive notifications?
- How do we balance
  - notification info (status update/action items),
  - widgets (showing upcoming appointments, their local VAMC, maybe delivery updates for prescriptions, etc), and
  - links into tools (eg. top tasks)?
