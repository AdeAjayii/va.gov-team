## Intro - 3 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Our team is working on re-designing the homepage you see when you log in to VA.gov. Today I'd like to talk a bit about your experience when you log in to the site, and then go into detail about what would make a logged-in homepage most useful to you.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   **This entire session should take about 45-60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

-   **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the logged-in experience to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

-   **You'll be going through an activity to help us understand how we can design a homepage that best meets your needs.** We'll be using a virtual board to create a rough version of a homepage that would best meet your needs and expectations.  I'll drive the mouse so you can focus, and don't have to worry learning how to use the virtual board. Again, please note we're not testing you in any way, and there are no right or wrong answers.

-   **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

-   **Do you have any questions so far?**

-   **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*Start recording.*

-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

Before we start the activities I mentioned, I'd like to ask a few questions about how you use VA.gov.

-   Do you remember the last time you visited VA.gov. What were you doing?

-   Do you remember if you logged in?

-   Can you explain whether or not that was a typical experience for you?

-   Tell me about some other times you've gone to the site.

-   How about other times you've logged in? 

-   When you visit the site, how often do you sign in?

Great! Thanks for sharing all of that with me.  Before we jump into our activity, I'd like to look at VA.gov with you. 

## First Task: Review current logged-in homepage - 5 minutes

I'm going to share my screen, and log into the site.
*Go to staging.va.gov, share screen and log in. Moderator will be on the homepage.*

-   Alright, I'm logged in- I'd like to learn more about your thoughts on the current logged-in experience.

-   Tell me how what you see lines up with your expectations.

-   Is this what you typically see when you log in?

That's helpful, thank you.  Alright, now we can get started with the next part of the session.

## Second Task: Create and Review Items - 10 minutes

I'm going to hop over to a tool called Mural.  This is what we'll use for our activity today.  

You can see here that I've set up some blank sticky notes for us to get started, and I created some rough outlines that can serve as our pages for this exercise. One can represent the homepage you see when you log in to VA.gov; I created the other in case there's another location that makes more sense to you.

First, we'll use the stickies to create items to put on the page.  Then, we'll organize them in the way that would be the most useful to you, if it were a real page.

I also want to show you the annotation tool in Zoom. This will allow you to point to things on the screen, write, or draw something if needed.

*Guide participant to annotation tool, and have them try it out.*

- To get started, let's create some stickies for the top 5 things you'd want to see when you log in.  Talk me through what those 5 items might be.
  *Create sticky notes with each item.* 

- Why are those 5 things the most helpful for you?

- Okay, I'd like to show you some other stickies I made ahead of time that I thought might spark some interest for you.
  *If applicable, remove any duplicates.*

- Now, please take a moment to review them, and think out loud as you do - I'd love to know how these resonate with you.

  *Allow participant to review cards and encourage them to verbalize their thoughts as they do so.*

- Are there any cards missing that would be valuable to you? We can go ahead and add them.

### Things to watch for:

-   How confident is the participant when listing their top 5 tasks?

-   How did the pre-populated cards resonate with the participant?

-   Which items is the participant most confident they'd be interested in?

-   Do any items cause the participant to hesitate?

-   Any mention of notifications or updates?

## Third Task: Organize Items - 20 minutes

Great! Now, we'll move on to our pages - I made two in advance, one to represent your homepage, and another one in case you feel like something belongs somewhere that isn't a homepage.   We can make more pages too, if needed.

Let's organize the stickies on the page in the way you'd want to see them. Tell me where to put each one, and why you think it should go there.  You can use the annotation tool to point if that's easier to guide where things go.

-   *Organize stickies with participant, encouraging them to continue thinking out loud and asking for clarification.*

-   *If it doesn't happen organically:* Should we group any of these together?  Where would you want to see these groups?

-   *As appropriate, ask participants to elaborate on possible next steps they'd expect for certain items, and if they'd expect to have access to those from anywhere else in the site*

-   *Once it feels like they're done:* It feels like we're slowing down and things might be in a pretty good place.  How are you feeling about what we've done here? Do we need to make any adjustments?

-   *If it hasn't been discussed:*  Many sites have some kind of way to provide people with notifications and updates when they log in. What, if anything, would you expect to see with regards to notifications or updates for these items or sections?

### Things to watch for:

-   Does any part of the organization cause the participant to hesitate or get stuck?

-   What sections or groupings does the participant create?

-   Does the participant make any distinction between the homepage and another possible section of the site (profile)?

-   Where does the participant place notification related items?

-   What expectations does the participant have around notifications and updates?

## Backup Task 1: Card Sort - 20 minutes

Since Mural is giving us a hard time, I've got a back-up plan.  We can do a card sorting activity, which will be a great way to help our team understand how to organize and prioritize a homepage based on what is most useful to you.  I'll send you a link, which will give you some more instructions about what to do. I'm here if you have questions.

-   Before we jump in, thinking about what your ideal homepage would be like when you logged in - what are the top 5 things you'd want to see?

-   Great, thank you. I'm going to send you a link to the card sort now.
    *Send participant the link. If necessary, guide them through Optimal prompts*

-   You'll notice one of the categories is blank - this is in case you feel one of the items belongs somewhere other than on a homepage.

-   Go ahead and start moving the cards. I'm really interested in your thought process, so please try to think aloud as you move them.

    -   *As needed, encourage participant to think aloud and ask for clarification*

    -   *As appropriate, ask participants to elaborate on possible next steps they'd expect for certain cards, and if they'd expect to have access to those from anywhere else in the site*

-   *Once it feels like they're done:* It feels like we're slowing down and things might be in a pretty good place.  How are you feeling about what we've done here? Do we need to make any adjustments?

-   Are any cards missing that would be valuable to you?

### Things to watch for:

-   How confident is the participant when listing their top 5 tasks?

-   How did the pre-populated cards resonate with the participant?

-   Which cards is the participant most confident they'd be interested in?

-   Do any cards cause the participant to hesitate?

-   How does the participant respond to the 2 categories?

-   Any mention of notifications or updates?

## Backup Task 2: Grouping cards - 10 minutes

Alright, now let's take a look at what we've got in these categories.

-   Should we group any of them together?
    *Prompt participant to talk through reasoning behind groupings*

-   Talk me through how you'd want to see these on a homepage
    *Use the annotation tool in Zoom if needed to sketch out ideas and confirm understanding of participants feedback*

-   *Once it feels like they're done:* How are you feeling about what we've done here? Do we need to make any adjustments?

-   *If it hasn't been discussed:*  Many sites have some kind of way to provide people with notifications and updates when they log in. What, if anything, would you expect to see with regards to notifications or updates for these items or sections?

### Things to watch for:

-   Does any part of the organization cause the participant to hesitate or get stuck?

-   What sections or groupings does the participant create?

-   Does the participant want to add even more categories?

-   Where does the participant place notification related items?

-   What expectations does the participant have around notifications and updates?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

-   Is there anything you'd want to see on the pages/cards we made today that we haven't talked about?

-   Is there anything you'd want to be able to do from the pages we made that we haven't talked about?

-   If applicable: Throughout this session, I've been using the word "homepage" - how does that resonate with you? Would you call it something different?

-   If applicable: We didn't really talk about how this homepage might be different from your VA profile. Maybe they shouldn't be different. What are your thoughts around that?

-   Do you have any other thoughts on anything we discussed today you want to be sure to share before we wrap up?

-   Any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute
