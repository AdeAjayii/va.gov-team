## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Our team is working on re-designing the homepage you see when you log in to VA.gov. Today I'd like to talk a bit about your experience when you log in to the site, and then go into detail about what would make a logged-in homepage most useful to you. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45-60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve the logged-in experience to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be going through an activity to help us understand how we can design a homepage that best meets your needs.** We'll be using a virtual board to create the equivalent of Post-it notes, and organizing them together to reflect what is most important to you.  I'll drive the mouse so you can focus, and don't have to worry learning how to use the virtual board or any technical glitches.  
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

Before we start the activities I mentioned, I'd like to ask a few questions about how you use VA.gov.

Why do you visit VA.gov?

When you visit the site, how often do you sign in?

Why do you sign in?

I'd like to learn more about your experience once you're logged in. How does it line up with what you  expect?

What would you expect from logging into VA.gov in say, the next 6-12 months? How about further out, like 3-5 years?

Thanks for sharing all of that with me.  Let's get started!

## First Task: Participant's Top 5 - 10 minutes

*Share screen with Mural board pulled up* 

You're looking at a tool called Mural, and this is what we'll use for our activity today.  You can see here I've pulled some blank sticky notes out for us to get started, and there are a couple of boxes over here than can serve as our pages for this exercise.

 I also want to show you the annotation tool in Zoom. This will allow you to point to things on the screen, write, or draw something if needed.

*Instruct participant to try annotating with the Zoom tool* 

- To get started, let's write down the top 5 things you'd want to see on your homepage when you log in.

  *Create sticky notes with each item. Prompt participant to elaborate on anything that isn't clear.*

- Great! Now, let's go to our pages - tell me where you would want to see these on the homepage. Or you can show me with the annotation tool.

  *Move items. Again, prompt participant to elaborate on anything that isn't clear.*

- Talk me through your thinking for why you'd want to see these things where you've placed them.

- *If appropriate based on their 5 items, ask:*

  - What would you do 

### Things to watch for:

- Was it a struggle to pick 5 things? How much confidence does the participant exhibit when listing their top 5 tasks? 
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

## Second Task: Pre-populated Stickies - 20 minutes

- Step 1
- Step 2

## Backup Task: Card Sort - 30 minutes

- Step 1
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]



## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

- Is there anything you'd want to see on your homepage that we haven't talked about?
- Is there anything you'd want to be able to do from your homepage that we haven't talked about?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
