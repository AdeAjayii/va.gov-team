## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about your experience when you log into VA.gov and how we might improve it to better meet your needs. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45-60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be going through a couple of activities to help us understand how we can organize a  homepage to best meet your needs.** One is a cart sorting activity and the other NEED TO ELABORATE ON THIS ONCE WE DECIDE
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
  - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions - 10 minutes

Before we start the activities I mentioned, I'd like to ask a few questions about how you use VA.gov.

Why do you visit VA.gov?

How often do you log in when you visit the site?

Why do you log in?

I'd like to learn more about your experience when you're logged in. How does it line up with what you  expect?

What would you expect from logging into VA.gov in say, the next 6-12 months? How about further out, like 3-5 years?
