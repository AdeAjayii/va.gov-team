## Samara's preliminary list

### Items I think we should include in another card sort

These were all included in the summer card sort and I think would be good in another card sort aimed at differentiating the dashboard from the profile. Some of these seem like they would clearly live in one location or the other, but many could, in theory, go in either place.

2. A list of your prescriptions and refill statuses
3. Schedule an appointment at the VA
4. Download your VA medical records

### Items from last summer’s card sort that I don’t think we need to include in a new one

**Benefit applications** 

These will be included in some fashion on the homepage. These don’t make sense in the profile since that would hide in-progress applications and since we do not keep a record of completed applications

26.	Your application for VA health care
27.	Your GI Bill benefits application
28.	Your disability claim(s)
29.	Your pre-need application for burial in a VA National Cemetery
30.	Your application for a VA pension
31.	Your Specially Adapted Housing Grant application
32.	Your Vocational Rehab application
33.	Your application for a VA Home Loan Certificate of Eligibility
34.	Updates on the status of your health care application

**Getting started info**

We already know we’ll need this on the logged in homepage for new users.)

35.	How to get started with VA benefits
36.	Benefit eligibility

**Notifications**

We already know we will show these on the logged-in homepage in some fashion. These wouldn’t go in the profile.

37.	An alert that your disability claim has been approved
38.	An alert that your application for GI Bill benefits has been approved
