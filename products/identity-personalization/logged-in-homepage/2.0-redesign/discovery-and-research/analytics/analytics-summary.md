## Questions we were trying to answer

## Product Questions

We're broadly trying to figure out how to create a more useful logged in homepage, one that is the most useful blend of dashboard/personal information and links to tools. We want to do a better job than we are now of showing veterans the full picture of their care at the VA in one place, and a better job of helping them complete the tasks they come to VA.gov to complete.

To help us figure this out, we'd like to better understand:

- Why people come to VA.gov.
- What people do on VA.gov
- How people move through the site.
- How people use the homepage.
- How people use My VA.
- Areas for improvement for existing functionality.
- How people's experience with the site might change if we had a proper notification system.

## Analytics to Track Down

I'm pretty sure most, if not all, of these metrics are already tracked, but we don't know where or how to track them down ourselves. That's where we need your help.

We'd like to know the following:

**General**

- What are the top ~20  pages visited on VA.gov?
  - How does this change if we look at top pages for logged out users vs. logged in users?
- What are the top ~20 search terms on VA.gov? 
- Is there a pattern to where people are in the site when they decide to search?
- What are the top ~20 entry points for VA.gov?
- What are the top ~20 organic search terms people are using to get to VA.gov?
- After people enter the site, what is the next thing they do?
- % of traffic by device (desktop; tablet; mobile).

**Homepage**

- What page do people visit BEFORE the homepage?
- How often is the homepage people's first entry point?
- What do people do from the homepage? (ie. what links do they click?)
- How many people visit the homepage?

**My VA**

- What page do people visit BEFORE My VA?
- Is My VA ever a first entry point?
- What do people do from My VA? (ie. what links do they click?)
- How many people visit My VA?
