# Logged-in homepage discovery: Analytics review

## Project overview

As part of the [logged-in homepage discovery effort](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/research-plan.md), we conducted an analytics review to learn more about user behavior related to VA.gov overall, the homepage, and the My VA dashboard.

## Goals

Analytics are an especially good way of seeing what people are doing. They can't tell us why, but they can tell us what. The data that was pulled for us was especially good at giving us insight into the following:

- Why do people come to VA.gov? What people do they do here?
- Who's using the homepage? Who's using My VA?
- How do people interact with the homepage?
- How do people interact with My VA?

## Analytics

Our incredible analytics team pulled a ton of data for us. Here are the links to the reports referenced in this document:

## Why do people come to the site? What do they do here?

### What people do depends on what data you're looking at. We see different behavior patterns when we look at the "modernized" vs. "non-modernized" data.

Fortunately, we have access to analytics for anything that falls under the VA.gov domain. Of course, this includes the "modernized" site our team redesigned in 2018 â€” anything that falls under www.va.gov/, but this also includes data for MyHealtheVet (myhealth.va.gov), eBenefits (ebenefits.va.gov), and VBA's site (benefits.va.gov) because those sites all live as subdomains under VA.gov. We looked at both data sets to get the most full picture of veteran behavior.

### On the modernized site (va.gov), the claim status tool is king.

Whether we are looking at data by pageviews **(~60MM)** or popular landing pages **(~5.4MM sessions)**, the claim status tool is the most popular tool on the modernized VA.gov. Information on how to apply for disability benefits **(~2.6MM pageviews)** and the disability hub **(~1.7MM pageviews)** are also popular.

**Recommendation**: Emphasize the disability and claim products in the logged in experience, as this is a major reason people come to VA.gov.

### On the modernized site (va.gov), content and tools related to the GI bill, facility locator, prescriptions, records, and VIC rounded out the top 25 pages.

**Facility locator (~27MM)**, the **GI Bill statement of benefits (3.4MM)**, and the **download your VA letters tool (~2MM)**. People also wanted to **view payment history (~2.4MM)** and **refill their prescriptions (~1.7MM)** even though these tools do not exist on VA.gov.

On the modernized site, we only saw one health tool â€” refill prescriptions â€” in the top 25. This is likely because health care is primarily managed on MHV. We should review the non-modernized data to get a more full picture of the importance of health tools.

More unexpected: going by pageview, **My VA (~6.8MM)** is more popular than we would have expected. This may indicate an interest in seeing personalized benefit information.

### In the non-modernized data, we can see [conclusion].

[Details]

**Recommendation**: [Put recommendation here]. 

### The data also tells different stories for logged out and logged in users. Logged out users are more interested in exploring/applying for benefits... 

"Explore/apply" content is popular on VA.gov. **How to apply for GI Bill/education benefits (~2.8MM)**, **disability content (~4MM)**, and **veteran ID card content (~3.2MM)**) all made it into the top 25 pages overall. However, we saw that the focus on explore/apply skewed more towards logged out users when we looked at top pages broken down by logged in vs. logged out users.

**Recommendation**: Long term, work with the unauthenticated/global UX team to figure out how we can seamlessly transition users from a logged out to logged in experience when users may have different needs ranging from exploring to managing benefits.

### ... whereas logged in users are more interested in checking the status of their benefits or accessing their records. 

For logged in users, we can see that tools and tasks were more likely to be the focus, with our typical cast of characters (claim status, GI Bill, VA benefit letters, prescriptions) all making it into the top 25.

**Recommendation**: Create a tool/task-focused navigation for logged in users, both on the logged-in homepage and throughout the authenticated experience.

### People start on the homepage, the claim status tool, and the facility locator.

This data tells us the first page people land on when they come to the modernized VA.gov. This may reflect how people are being directed via search engine results or what pages people have bookmarked.

The **homepage (~25MM)** was the most popular by orders of magnitude, with the **claim status tool (~5.4MM)** and the **facility locator (~2MM)** rounding out the top 3. Other popular landing pages include many of the content pages we've already related as popular, namely content related to health care, disability, and education benefits.

**Recommendation**: [Is there a recommendation]

### People are searching for general health and benefit information, forms, and some specific tasks we may want to do a better job of elevating.

- **"Benefits" (153,244)** and **"health" (58,827)** are the most searched terms. Given how generic these terms are, this may suggest that people are looking for more help and assistance from us on getting started with benefits.
- **"Forms" (24,197)** is also high on the list, which suggests people want a full list of VA forms.
- Benefits-related terms like **"direct deposit" (12,723)**, **"cemetery" (9,726)**, and **"certificate of eligibility" (8,154)** are high on the list, which suggests that we may need to elevate these tools more.
- **"DD214" (8,597)** is high on the list, further reflecting people's desire to get their military records.

## How do people use the homepage?

### People come back to the homepage through the sign in flow, and then through many of the site's most popular pages.

People come to the homepage through the **sign in flow (~6MM combined through DS logon, MHV, and ID.me)** and many of the other popular pages on the site, including the **claim status tool (~2.4MM)**, **view payment history (455,233)**, and **refill and track prescriptions (361,060)**.

### From the homepage, people primarily navigate into the tools displayed in the top 20 tasks. 

As expected, almost all of the top 25 interactions on the homepage take place in the top 20 tasks, with notable excpetions being the sign in prompt and some interaction with the main nav. In the top 20 tasks, **Check your claim or appeal status (~5MM)**, **View payment history (759,540)**, and **Refill and track your prescriptions (516,320)** had the most clicks.

This further shows the reliance on the top 20 tasks and suggests we should take extra care with how we handle these when creating a personalized logged-in homepage.

### People come to my VA via many of the same paths that lead them to the homepage, just in smaller numbers.

People come to My VA through **sign in (~600K)**, the **claim status tool (393,342)**, and **view payment history (75,162)** just like they do on the homepage. They just do so in a much smaller quantity.

### Login is the primary action taken from My VA.

Since you can't view My VA without being logged in, it's interesting that the most popular action by far from My VA is to **log in (~5MM events)**. This may suggest that people are going directly to this page and signing in from here, potentially people who have bookmarked this page.

### Claims, VA letters, and profile information are all popular next steps from My VA.

Unsurprisingly, people who come to My VA have the same priorities as other users â€” they want to **track claims (~560K)** and **download their VA letters (239,802)**, among other things. They also want to go to their **profile (304,902)** which was a unique interaction we didn't see from the homepage, likely because a link to the profile is featured prominently from the dashboard.
