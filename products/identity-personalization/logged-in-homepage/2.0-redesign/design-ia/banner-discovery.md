**Banner/Alerts**

TL;DR - There will be one style of full-width banner component, rather than having 2 variations. Instead of having 2 kinds of behavior (dismissable vs. show less/more), it will always be configurable to be dismissable. It's possible there could be up to 3 across the top of the home page. They will be full width, stacked, pushing all content below (not overlaying content on the page)

Hierarchy of alerts: 

1/ Emergency banner (always first - these do not have a specific expiration date) - yellow

2/ System maintanence banner - yellow (advance)/ red (during)

3/ Veteran action needed - yellow
