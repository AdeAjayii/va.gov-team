# Logged-in homepage outline and timeline

Based on the [V1 plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/product/v1-plan.md) and [Logged-in homepage discovery summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md) that Liz Lantz put together, we have planned out phases to design and build the new Logged-in homepage. 

There are two directions that we could potentially tackle this work.

1. Decide on our high level concept, then dig into each benefits category and code each of those one-by-one.
2. Decide on our high level concept, code the most MVP version of all benefits categories and then iterate up from there on all categories. 

The strategy we have outlined below is based on the first direction because it feels like focusing on one category at a time will ensure the best experience for veterans. 

We broke this strategy down into 3 phases.

- Phase 1: Create 2-3 high-level concepts for logged-in homepage
- Phase 2: Design Healthcare and Disability sections
- Phase 3: Design Education and Records sections

## Phase 1: Create 2-3 high-level concepts for logged-in homepage: ~ 1 sprint
