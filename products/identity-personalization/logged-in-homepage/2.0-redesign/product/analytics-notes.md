### Users

[Report](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/?authuser=0#/report/visitors-overview/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20200101&_u.date01=20200712&_.useg=builtin1,userTBuj9_dPSF-sBQQO9Srv-g/)

- About 8% of users who go to VA.gov (modernized) go to My VA. 
- Users who view My VA have more sessions on average than users who do not. This makes sense â€” you need to login to view My VA, so users who are logging in are getting more value and may be coming back to check things like claim status.

### Engagement

- Users who view my VA tend to view the site anywhere between 1 minute - 30 minutes, with the most being in the 3 - 10 minute range.
- They also mostly view 1 -2 pages, with another even distribution in the curve between 6 - 9 pages.

- Users tend to not view the My VA page multiple days in a row, which is expected and fine. The information there isn't going to update daily, so there is little incentive to have them logging in everyday.

- If I'm reading this report correctly, ~3% of pageviews for logged in users on the modernized site were of My VA. That number feels "low" until you consider that it's in the top 10 pages for logged in users and is only below the homepage and claim status-related content, which is the most popular tool on the site.

### Behavior

- People who view My VA are mostly interested in viewing their claim status. This is probably the most important thing we can feature on the logged-in homepage.
- These users are also interested in facilities info, records info, payment info, GI bill info, and profile info.
- Health info is less popular in this view because we are looking at modernized site data only, but we should keep in mind health content/MHV is the most popular info in the VA digital ecosystem.

- In terms of pages feeding in to My VA, we see the homepage, claim status, the profile, the Find VA benefits tool (which is on My VA), the account page, and search.
- In terms of what people do from My VA, we see the most popular next step is to go to the profile. The account page is also in the top 10. I wonder if this is less because those are the most important interactions people want to take and actually because there is info the expect to see on My VA that they do not. We should continue to be mindful of this relationship between a dashboard and a profile going forward and continue to move towards clarifying what lives where.
- Finding VA benefits is the second most popular action. Unclear if this is because it's at the top of the page or how useful people find it.
- Download records ranks at number 6, underscoring its importance.
- They also go to MHV. I think this may be from the "My Health" link, though unclear if they are clicking through from a Rx or message.
- Going to the claim status tool is actually number 10 in the top 10. Unclear if this is because people can see the status right on My VA, or if because they have already been to the claim status tool and don't need to go back.
