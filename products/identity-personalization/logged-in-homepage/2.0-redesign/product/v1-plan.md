# Logged-in homepage: V1 plan

This document lists what Samara would like to see on version 1 of the new logged-in homepage. We may decide this is too much for one project and instead break version 1 into multiple phases.

## Version 1 features

### My VA tools that are moving over

- Your applications
- Claim and appeal status
- Health enrollment status
- Refill prescriptions
- Secure messages
- Schedule an appointment

### Features we're adding that are not currently on My VA

- Overall disability rating 

### Links on the homepage we need to include

We basically need to include all of the links in the top 20 tasks on the homepage, **but** we'll show them conditionally if we have the ability to do so. This will make this  So, if someone already has health care, we won't show the link to apply for health care, but if they don't have health care, we will show that link (but not links to prescription, messaging, or appointment info).

These are the links from the existing homepage.

**Health care**

- Refill and track your prescriptions (a link to view prescriptions will be shown conditionally if someone has prescriptions)
- Send a secure message to your health care team (a link to view messages will be shown conditionally if someone has messages)
- Schedule and view your appointments (shown conditionally if someone has health care in general)
- View your lab and test results (shown conditionally if someone has health care in general)
- Apply now for VA health care (shown conditionally if someone does NOT have health care)

**Disability**

- Check your claim or appeal status (shown conditionally if someone has a claim or appeal in progress)
- View your payment history
- Upload evidence to support your claim (shown conditionally if someone has a claim or appeal in progress)
- File for a VA disability increase (shown conditionally if someone has a disability rating)
- File a claim for compensation

**Education**

- View your payment history
- Change your current education benefits
- Compare GI Bill benefits by school
- Apply for education benefits

**Records**

- Records
- Get Veteran ID cards
- Get your VA medical records
- Download your benefit letters
- Change your address
- Request your military records (DD214)

## Other expectations for version 1

-	A visual redesign of the My VA elements moving over to the logged-in homepage. We should NOT just move the blocks over as-is.
-	A very basic first-time user experience that will account for users who have no benefits and no applications in flight.
-	Retiring My VA.

## Out of scope for version 1

-	Doing anything with the Find VA benefits content that currently exists on My VA.
-	Incorporating any new data or integrations that do not already exist on VA.gov.
-	Any main navigation work.
-	Any "notification center" work.
