# Logged-in homepage: Project 1 - Logged-in homepage redesign and retirement of MyVA

Based off of the [V1 plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/product/v1-plan.md) and the [Logged-in homepage discovery summary](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md) that Samara put together, we have planned out phases to design and build the new Logged-in homepage. 

First, we'll break this work into three projects:

- Project 1: The logged-in homepage redesign.
- Project 2: Creation of a logged-in navigation.
- Project 3: Creation of a notification center.

This first project is focused on the logged-in homepage redesign and retirement of MyVA. We have broken this project down into 3 phases.

- Phase 1: Design and plan the high-level wireframe for the blue sky logged-in homepage.
- Phase 2: Design Healthcare and Disability section
- Phase 3: Design Education and Records sections

We refer to the 'blue sky' version of the logged-in homepage, and we'd like to outline our definition of this term in relation to this project. 

- 'Blue Sky Version': The ideal outcome for this project. This includes all requirements from Samara's [V1 plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/product/v1-plan.md)
