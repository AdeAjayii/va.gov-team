View the [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/user-roles/discovery/sme-interviews/user-roles-sme-research-plan.md).

## Research Goals

1. Understand the unique definitions and nuances each administration has for non-Veterans.

2. Define tasks each non-Veteran user type may need to complete for each administration.

## Research Methodology

We conducted 30 minute semi-structured interviews over Zoom.

### Who we talked to

We spoke to SMEs in VHA and VBA; a specific list of individuals we spoke to is available [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/user-roles/discovery/sme-interviews/README.md).

### Research Questions

1. What non-Veteran user roles does each administration serve?
2. What qualifies a person as a dependent or a beneficiary? How are those roles different?
3. What is the difference between POAs, CVSOs, VSOs, and claim agents, according to each administration?
4. What qualifies a person as a caregiver?
5. What are the tasks that each user type may need to do?

## Findings

1. Dependents

   - VBA Dependent is someone who is financially dependent on the Veteran. **need to verify VHA**
   - Could be a spouse, child (minor or helpless adult), or parent
   - A Veteran can add a dependent to their compensation claim to increase their award
   - Dependents who are not beneficiaries would not need their own login.
   - MPI knows whether or not someone is a VHA dependent **need to verify VBA**

2. Beneficiaries

   - Anyone who is the direct recipient of a benefit or service from VA. This could be a Veteran, or a qualifying family member.
   - Each benefit has specific qualifications to determine beneficiary eligibility. 
   - MPI knows whether or not someone is a VHA beneficiary**need to verify VBA**
   - Beneficiary tasks are the same regardless of if they are a Veteran or a non-Veteran.

3. Caregivers

   - May be officially recognized through the VA Caregiver Assistance Program. 
     - Veteran has to have a service connected illness or disability to qualify for a VA recognized caregiver.
     - There is specific criteria for this program clearly defined on VA.gov.
   - Can also be self-identified Caregiver. This would be for a Veteran who needs help for non-service connected illness or disability.
     - This type of caregiver could be given access to health information through the VA delegate program. **Need to verify that a delegate can also see VBA information**
   - Caregiver tasks would be the same as a Veteran's if they were able to care for themselves.
   - **How about nursing homes and other professional caregivers?**

4. Delegates

   - This language is used in VHA to refer to people who have been assigned delegate authority per the request of a Veteran
   - This person has been vetted by VA
   - Delegates have access to their own account, and act on behalf of the Veteran, in MHV and some VA Mobile Apps
   - Delegates are added to IAM and MPI

5. Veteran Advocates

   - VSOs, Claim agents, Attorneys
     - Would need to see Veteran data related to claims
     - SEP and D2D would be worth looking to to better understand tasks for these users and get a sense of how their needs are being met today.
   - Fiduciaries
     - Would need to see Veteran data related to financial information
     - There's a system called VBMS FID that was recently expanded; this would be worth looking to to better understand fiduciary tasks and get a sense of how their needs are being met today.

6. 3rd-party organizations that receive payments from VA

   - Funeral homes (one-time payments)
   - Nursing homes (recurring, could be for multiple veterans)
   - State cemeteries (one-time payments)
   - Possible use cases for these users would be to see payment history and status, as well as file claims for reimbursement.
   - Burial claims can already be submitted electronically through eBenefits.
