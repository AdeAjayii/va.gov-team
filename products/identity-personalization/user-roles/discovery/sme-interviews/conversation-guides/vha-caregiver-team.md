# Conversation Guide for non-Veteran SME Interviews Caregiver team

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz Lantz, and I'm a UX designer and researcher working on VA.gov.  Our product owner, Samara, and product managers, AJ and Heather, are also on the call to listen and learn from you. Our team works on the logged-in experience of VA.gov. Currently, that experience is dedicated to Veterans, and we're starting to think about how we might support non-Veterans accounts on VA.gov. We're here today to learn more about how VHA defines different non-Veteran user types such as dependents, caregivers, delegates, etc so we can find a common understanding across the various parts of the VA.

**Do you have any questions so far?**

**Are you comfortable if I record the audio as we talk today?** I use the recordings to confirm that I have captured everything accurately in my notes. I'll delete the recordings after I synthesis all my notes.

- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Introduction

1. I know you all work on the Caregiver program but I'm not sure of specifics. Can you give me some background on your roles and the work that you do?

2. What are the different non-Veteran user types that your administration works with?

## Caregivers

I know there are two types of caregivers to be considered. Those that are recognized by the VA through the Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers Program, and self-identified caregivers who support veterans that don't have a service connected illness or injury. 

Do you work with both types of caregivers?

What tasks would either of these caregiver types need to do?

What kind of things does being a VA recognized caregiver authorize a person to do on behalf of the Veteran?

How do VA database identify a person as a caregiver? Is this in MPI, IAM, etc?

Are you familiar with the VA Online Health Delegation program? How does that intersect with Caregivers as far as you know?

How do nursing homes and other professional caregivers fit in the picture?

Do you know anything about how those caregivers get paid from the VA?

How would a self-identified caregiver help a Veteran with non-Health care tasks (filing an appeal) 

Is a Veteran ever managing things for themselves when they have a caregiver?

## Dependent vs Beneficiary

- What qualifies a person as a dependent?
- What qualifies someone as a beneficiary?
- Do you consider a Caregiver a beneficiary?
- How are those roles different, and the same?
- Do you have to be a dependent to be a beneficiary?

## Veteran Advocates

- What can you tell me about POAs, CVSOs, VSOs, and claim agents as it relates to your work?

- What are the tasks that that person type may need to do?

  

## Business Line Priorities

From a VHA perspective, what do you think is the most important use case for non-Veterans?

## Next steps and Closing
