## Overview

The identity team asked the authenticated experience team to help them with research supporting the initiative to add non-veteran user roles to VA.gov. Our research aims to complete the following objectives:

1. Define all non-Veteran user roles for VHA, VBA, and NCA; identify the specific user types / roles, and what criteria a user needs to fit to qualify, according to each administration.
2. Translate administration-specific user roles into a VA-wide set of unified definitions, which encompasses all user types / roles.Identify use cases and outcomes for each of the non-Veteran user roles across VHA, VBA, and NCA.
3. (Stretch goal) Identify use cases and outcomes for each of the non-Veteran user roles across VHA, VBA, and NCA.


## Problem Statement

Currently, there is not a unified definition for each of the non-veteran customer types at the VA. Each administration — VHA, VBA, and NCA — has their own unique definitions and nuances, which increases the complexity of implementing non-veteran user roles on VA.gov. Delegates, beneficiaries, caregivers, and dependents are a few terms used interchangeably that encompass many different user types relying on many different products and services across VA.

## Desired Outcomes

### User outcomes

- This reseach continues to move us towards being able to support non-veteran customers on VA.gov.

### Business outcomes

We hope to accomplish the following with our research:

- All non-Veteran user roles for VHA, VBA and NCA are defined as specific user types/roles.
- We can define each administration's criteria for each user role.
- We have unified definitions across administrations for each user role that can guide how we might define different user types on VA.gov.

## Undesired Outcomes

### User outcomes

- This research should **not** be directly translated  to functionality on VA.gov without first conducting additional research to verify our assumptions with user research. This would put us at risk for building something that's not actually helpful to our non-veteran customers.

### Business outcomes

- We are unable to figure out broad categories for each user role that we can apply to VA.gov.

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
