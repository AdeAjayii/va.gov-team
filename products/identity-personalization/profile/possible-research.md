# Profile Updates

This document serves to capture smaller updates we've made to profile that don't warrant their own research study, but should be evaluated as we have the opportunity in larger studies.

## Profile menu design update + unsticking
- **Release date**: menu design was launched in 2020; menu was unstuck (date forthcoming)
