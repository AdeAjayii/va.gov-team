# Discovery summary: adding records and dependents to profile, June 2023

`draft`

**Last updated:** June 20, 2023

## Background
After conducting research to understand challenges people have navigating to tasks while logged in, we identified a few personalized items that are hard to find on the site, and are reasonably logical to surface in the authenticated experience:
- Dependents
- Benefit letters
- Claim letters
- Veteran ID card

Weâ€™ve previously received requests to add dependents to the profile. Letters and ID cards are no longer linked from the homepage as of June 1, 2023, which make them even harder to find.

We conducted some initial discovery to determine which of these items make sense to add to the VA.gov profile, and develop an approach to how they could be incorporated.

## Goals
1. Understand what we know so far about how Veterans think about and navigate to dependents, letters, and their ID card
2. Understand how these items fit into the current site IA
3. Determine an approach to how we can add these to profile

## Findings
### Previous research

### Search behavior

### Navigation behavior

### Content/IA

## Recommendations
