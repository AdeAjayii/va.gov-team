# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience Profile, Military Information, [Date]

## Background

Currently within a veteran’s (auth) Profile, veterans can read minimal information about their service details: namely, which branch(es) they served in, and dates of service.

Recently, VEO asked the VA.gov profile team to enhance the military history section of the profile in order to aid veterans applying for benefits (especially disability claims). 

As a result of this request, we're adding duty status, dates, and military occupation specialties (MOS) to Profile, since these data elements have the best quality at the moment.

### OCTO Priorities 

`NEEDS UPDATING: 2024 OCTO priorities are forthcoming!`

### Veteran Journey

The research applies at any stage from Starting Up through Aging.

## Research Goals	

**Goal 1**: Gain a better understanding of veteran mental models regarding their service occupations in order to inform how we present military information data, depending on data completeness and quality.

**Goal 2**: Gather feedback on our team’s proposed design mock-up for enhancing a veteran’s military information section with the data available to us currently (duty status, dates, and military occupation specialties).

### Outcome

Our intended outcomes of this research are to: 
- **use what we learn from veterans to inform the addition of data elements** to the military information section of the profile 
- **iterate on the organization and hierarchy of information of the design mock-up** to better align with veteran mental models

### Research questions

- How have veterans used their MOS data, especially as it relates to the PACT Act? 
	- Where/how did they get their data? How did they relay it back to the VA, if at all?
- How do veterans conceptualize their service history?
	- What language can we use to organize and label military occupational specialties that make sense to veterans across branches, experience levels, and rank?
- How effective is this current design mock-up in displaying MOS data?
	- What’s the most useful MOS data for veterans to access from their profile?
	- How useful is including the start date of each occupation specialty? What about end dates?
	- What do veterans do (or want to do) if their MOS data seems incomplete or inaccurate?

### Hypothesis

- We will observe similarities and differences between branches, lengths of service, and rank.
- We will gain insight into veteran mental models around organizing information.
- We will gather actionable feedback for making iterations on the design mock-up. 

## Methodology	

This research study mixes the generative and evaluative methods of interviewing, `[card sorting? mapping? brainstorming?]`, and concept testing `[it’s not really a usability test in my mind]`.

- We’ll begin the session with some generative questions around how veterans conceptualize their service history (with a specific focus on their occupations). 
- Next, we will do a lightweight mapping exercise using real data from the participant, with the participant telling the facilitator where to move MOS-related items around and group them.
- Last, we will ask some questions to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed military information design.

### Location

The sessions will be conducted remotely via Zoom.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach

We’d like to use Perigean to recruit 18 veterans for a total of 12 completed sessions.

### Recruitment criteria

#### **All participants**

Please recruit 3 veterans for a total of 2 completed sessions **per military branch**. Each participant must have served in at least 1 branch. These are the 6 branches we would like to cover:
- Air Force
- Army
- Coast Guard 
- Marine Corps 
- Navy
- Space Force

NOTE: If a participant has served in more than 1 branch, this can be considered as satisfying 2 completed sessions.

100% must have submitted a disability claim

#### **Some participants**
- 50% must have submitted a disability claim under the PACT Act
- 50% must have served overseas

##### Demographics
- Participants should be evenly split across genders, ages, races, and education levels

#### Screener questions

`I have nothing yet here – the only screener question I can think of is for the PACT Act – everything else seems like it would be covered under primary criteria in the Recruitment Request form, no?`

## Timeline
*Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person.* 

### ===Prepare===
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 
* Finalized design mock-up

### ===Research sessions===
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 1 hour
* Maximum Sessions per day: 3

### Availability
*When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**.* 
- *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

*Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.*
