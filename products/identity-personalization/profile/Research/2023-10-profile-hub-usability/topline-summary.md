**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

**Finding #1**

Participants tended to navigate to their Profile either by their authenticated menu or the the My VA link

**Finding #2**

Participants used a variety of methods for switching from one Profile section to another (mostly side navigation links, but also breadcrumbs and the auth menu Profile link)

**Finding #3**

Participants also used a variety of methods to navigate from a given section back to the Profile hub. While a few participants used the breadcrumbs, a few used the back button, authenticated menu Profile link, and a keyboard shortcut to the previous page.

**Finding #4**

Participants mentioned a few things that would be helpful in enhancing their Military information:

- Period of service should include duty status (active or inactive) because some benefits are only available to veterans if they were active. One participant shared the example of applying for a veteran car tag that requires active duty during a war.
- Including locations would also be helpful to track health information, such as exposure to hazards.
- One participant’s service letter showed different military information than the participant had in their profile (their VA.gov and VA app military information was identical). This bears further investigation.
- Having more information in one place would be helpful when veterans are in the process of submitting a claim, because they never know how granular the information that VA requests will be:

> I went through my claim process around 2017-18 and I'll be very frank -- I don't remember what that was like. I just know that I had the VFW helping me during that and they apparently helped collect a lot of info besides what I gave them, like with my DD214 and such. But if anyone was trying to do this on their own and didn't have for whatever reason, like the American Legion or the, the VFW helping them, it could be pretty helpful [to have this in their profile]. I don't know what kind of stuff they [VA] might ask and if they need to go into the weeds -- having it all there would actually be kind of nice, you know? And that's the, that's the weird part, right? Because we don't know, we never know how granular things will actually need to be. (P2)

**Finding #5**

Participants that used their auth menu for navigation seemed to have more success in finding links to dependents and/or letters than participants who weren't aware of their auth menu until promptedby the moderator.

P3 said they would not have expected to look in the auth menu for letters, and that the things the moderator asked P3 about earlier are [on the Letters page], when P3 thought they'd be right under the profile.

**Finding #6**

P13 used VoiceOver for navigation, and experienced technical issues (likely due to a recent operating system update)so VoiceOver did not always read things accurately. This participant wanted to click on the description of each section card to complete a requested task, as it seemed like it should have been a link given that each description started with a verb. The link text seemed repetitive to him.
