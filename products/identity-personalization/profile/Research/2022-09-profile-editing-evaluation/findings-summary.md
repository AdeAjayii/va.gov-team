## Research Goals
_First, set the context of this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey. Explain what a Veteran might do before and after using this tool. What moments does this tool live in? Are there moments that matter to keep in mind? What are Veteran’s familiarity with tools like this? (do they use tools like this, or is this something new)._
_[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)_

_Then, describe your goals for this research_

1. Learn whether or not our edit-in-place pattern presents major usability problems for people with cognitive disabilities on mobile devices.
2. Identify any other usability hurdles in profile.
**Note:** In this study, we’re going to test with a group of Veterans that would be most likely to have challenges with edit in place functionality: people with cognitive disabilities, those who use assistive technology, and those who have limited screen real estate. These are the people we are referring to when we say “people” throughout the rest of this document.


## Research Questions
1. What challenges do people encounter related to in-line editing, especially address information and notification preferences?
2. How easily can people understand and navigate address validation?
3. Do people encounter any usability hurdles with updating notification settings?

## Methodology 
We conducted this research through moderated sessions over Zoom. We asked participants to update profile information in a test account on VA.gov, and also review a prototype.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
* People will be able to easily update 1-2 field forms (such as phone number) with in-line editing.
	* Definitely true, since all participants were able to update their phone numbers, and even mailing addresses, without guidance.
* People will encounter usability hurdles with more complex forms/flows such as address validation.
	* Maybe true, because some participants:
		*  were rushing and didn’t notice the alerts
		* Attempted to edit another section without making a selection
		* were unsure how to get back to edit their entry
* People will not encounter significant usability hurdles when updating their notification settings.
	* Likely false, because some participants:
		* did not notice the name of the notification they were updating
		* thought they were finished updating their settings after adding their mobile number
		* were not sure what to do next after adding their mobile number
		* expected a save or submit button (rather than the auto-save function)
* If a people can edit their profile without major challenges, we can be more confident our edit-in-place pattern works well for *all* Veterans.
	* Likely true

## Key Findings


## Details of Findings 

_For each finding, list details with supporting quotes and images when possible. Please **add relevant keywords/labels to your findings** selected from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc). Adding keywords/labels to your findings will help others find research relevant to their work._

### Participants found little difference between editing contact information on one page compared to separate pages; both approaches were easily understood and usable.

Labels: label 1, label 2 

- Of the 10 participants we asked, only 2 noticed they were going to a new URL in the prototype and stayed on one page on the website. No one commented on this without being prompted.
- Once it was pointed out, 3 participants shared concerns about bandwidth loading a new page for each edit.
- When discussing differences between the two approaches, 8 of 10 participants stated they preferred to stay on one page. One participant who preferred the multi-page approach said it was because there were no alerts, which was only due to the fact that it was a prototype.

> It didn’t make a difference that it went to another page because my focus was just on updating the information. - P1

### Most participants found all the alerts and modals they encountered to be useful.

Labels: label 1, label 2 

- No participants were bothered or slowed down by encountering these alerts as they updated contact information.
- Many commented they were helpful and would prevent a mistake.
- Some participants moved too quickly to read the content in the alerts.

### The notification settings interface was intuitive for most participants, but the user flow and notification labels were confusing.

Labels: label 1, label 2 


- All but 2 participants understood the radio button options and that the update saved without clicking a button.
	- One participant landed on the page and was immediately confused by the lack of a button, and that a radio button was already selected.
	- A screen reader participant expected a checkbox instead of a radio button and did not realize there were 2 options until prompted to look more.
- The process of adding a mobile number and then updating notification settings was not intuitive for most participants. 
	- Many missed the “manage text notifications” link in the confirmation box and weren’t sure how to get back without guidance.
	- Some thought by adding a mobile number, they had updated their notification settings and had completed the process.

> That little piece that says, “go ahead and update notifications now” -  it just totally went right past me. I totally just missed it. - P1

- 5 of 11 missed the “Board of Veterans’ Appeals hearing reminder” label, and thought the notification was about Applications, Claims, and Decision Reviews

> Once I [update my setting], I can receive notifications on applications claims, decisions, and appeals. 


# Additional Insights
_Any additional insights that aren't "key findings." These can be powerful comments from users that don’t represent a pattern in this study, but may be part of one outside this study._

### Some participant felt the font was small
> Well, no, everything is blurry when I take off my glasses and my magnifier away. So it just takes me a minute to to do it, because the the font is so small - P1
