# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, Profile, September 2022

## Background
Accessibility specialists have been advocating for a “one thing per page” pattern for VA.gov forms for the last year. This pattern is known to improve the usability for complex forms by reducing cognitive load, improving error messages, reducing load times and more.

We’re considering this pattern for profile, but we’re not sure if there are actual user problems this would solve since profile has relatively simple forms. This research will help us identify usability problems that would be solved by this approach.

 * Related [GitHub ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/46871)

### OCTO Objectives 
This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) :
* Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
* Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features


### Veteran Journey
Our product fits into [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) at all stages. Veterans have personal information on file with VA from Starting Up and beyond.

## Research Goals	
1. Identify the problems users have editing information in their profile.
2. Identify any other usability hurdles in profile.

### Outcome
* The findings from this research will help our team determine if a “one thing per page” pattern is appropriate for any portions of profile.
* We’ll also identify other usability hurdles we can improve for users by iterating on our design.

### Research questions
1. What challenges do users encounter related to in-line editing, especially address information and notification preferences?
2. How easily can users navigate the address validation flow?
3. Do users encounter any usability hurdles with updating notification settings?


### Hypothesis
* People will be able to easily update 1-2 field forms (such as phone number) with in-line editing
* People will encounter usability hurdles with more complex forms/flows such as address validation
* People will not encounter significant usability hurdles when updating their notification settings
* People with cognitive disabilities will struggle the most with in-line editing

## Method	
We’ll conduct this research through moderated usability testing by having participants log into VA.gov and use their profile.

### Location
The research will be conducted remotely over Zoom, using Perigean’s account.

### Research materials
- Link to conversation guide (to come)
- Link to example letter (to come)

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
We’ll focus our recruitment on Veterans (through Perigean) since the VA.gov profile doesn’t support other user roles at this time.

Our recruitment will focus on groups that have been underrepresented in VA research so far, as well as people with cognitive disabilities, and people who use assistive technology.
