# Conversation Guide for Profile Editing Evaluation, September 2022

## Moderator logistics
- Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in 
Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).



### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- Keep observers in the waiting room
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*


## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a [number] additional observers during this session?

- If participant does not consent, use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
- If participant consents, admit observers. 
   - Ask notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

Today we're going to talk about making updates to the personal information VA has on file for you.  We’re interested to learn how our current pages support Veterans when they need to make updates.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 35-40 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- I’ll be asking you to log into your VA.gov account today and share your screen, which means we’ll see some of your personal information. Is that OK with you? /If not, end the session./
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## First Task: Update address - X minutes
Can you please start screen sharing with me? I can help you do that if you’re not sure how.

/Once screen sharing has begun:/

Imagine you received an email from the VA saying there was a problem with some of your personal information in your va.gov profile. The letter said to go to your VA.gov profile and update your home address.  

/Paste a link in the chat, or verbally tell the participant where to go/

- Go ahead and update your home address. /If it’s already correct, have the participant change something to go through the edit flow/ Please think out loud as you go through this update.
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Is the participant aware that they may be sharing personal information on their screen, and are they okay with that? - per question as needed]
- [Etc]

## Second Task: [TASK NAME] - X minutes

- Step 1
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

## Third Task: [TASK NAME] - X minutes

- Step 1
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Question 1
- Question 2
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future usability research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
