# Research Plan: Profile multi-feature UAT, July 2023

User Acceptance Testing for 
- profile editing as a sub-task
- notification settings default send
- notification settings checkbox UI updates

## Background  

### OCTO-DE Objectives 

### Veteran Journey 
Since Veterans can manage their VA.gov profile any time after becoming a Veteran, this work impacts the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from Starting Up and beyond.

## Research Goals	
The primary goal of our UAT is to confirm that 3 updates to the Profile function as intended for users who sign in with ID.me and/or login.gov.  The updates are
- the profile-wide editing as a sub-task feature (which we’re launching in notification settings)
- Leveraging the notification `default send` flags in VA Notify
- changing radio buttons to checkboxes in the notification settings user interface

Specifically, this research will be looking to validate the following use cases:
- 

### Outcome
Based on the outcome of this research study, we will either release this work to production, or make updates to correct any bugs or significant usability hurdles.

### Research questions
- 

### Hypothesis
- Our edit as a sub-task flow will work as expected
- Notification settings default send data will be sent as expected
- User can successfully update their notification settings as expected
## Method	
While sharing their screen in remote (Zoom) interviews, participants will complete specific tasks as part of UAT to either demonstrate that the VA.gov profile is functioning as expected.

**Verification level screener question**
We’d like you to review parts of the VA website that require you to log in to an identity-verified account. **Do you have an identify-verified account on VA.gov?**
You can check on this by logging into VA.gov and going to VA.gov/profile. If you see a prompt to verify your identity when you get to your profile page, your identity is **not** yet verified.
Response options: yes or no.
- Answering "yes" qualifies the participant
- Answering "no" disqualifies the participant

**Login method screener question**
Do you have a working login and password for any of the following VA.gov login methods? (Select 1-4 options). **You will need your login credentials for the research session, so please make sure your credentials work before answering this question.**
Response options (checkbox): DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, Login.gov, ID.me, None of the above
- If participant answers **only** DS Logon or MyHealtheVet, they are disqualified.
- If participant's answer includes either (or both) Login.gov or ID.me, they are qualified.
- If participant answers None of the above, they are disqualified.

**What email address(es) do you use to login to VA.gov?**
This is a fill in the blank question, no character limit, and is not qualifying or disqualifying.
