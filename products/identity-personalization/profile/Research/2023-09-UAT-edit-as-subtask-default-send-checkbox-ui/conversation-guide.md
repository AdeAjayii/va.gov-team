# Conversation Guide: Profile multi-feature UAT, September 2023

### Project-specific setup
- Check participant information to see what types of login(s) credentials they may have (Login.gov, ID.me, DS Logon, MyHealtheVet).

## Introduction - 2 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz. I am a researcher and designer who works on improving the VA.gov website so Veterans can get what they need quickly and easily. 

What I hope to do today is get your help in testing some technical changes we’ve made to the website. The changes we have made aren’t something anyone can see on the screen, but with your help we will be able to check whether we’ve set everything up correctly.

Before we start, I wanted to go over a few details:
- **This session should take 30 minutes of your time or less.** It involves me asking you to complete a few small tasks. Because I want to make sure we don’t keep you beyond half an hour, I may prompt you with the next question to keep things moving.
- **You will need your direct deposit information today.** I will ask you to re-enter your direct deposit information in order to make sure the system is doing what it’s supposed to, but we will not be making any changes to your account.
- **We will be able to see your real information today.** This may include some healthcare information and some claims information. However, you have the choice to stop screensharing during any of the tasks, and start again when you feel comfortable. 
- **You may end the session at any time, for any reason.** Just let me know.

I have some teammates who would like to observe our session and take notes for me, but only if you're comfortable with that. They'll be muted and off camera and you won't have to interact with them. Would you be okay with that, or do you prefer to keep the session just the two of us?

Do you have any questions for me before we begin?

 ## Screen questions - 3 minutes
1. Can you confirm for me that you have a username and password for VA.gov?
2. When you login at VA.gov, what is the type of login you tend to use (options are: Login.gov, ID.me, DS Logon, MyHealtheVet)
   - If participant has neither a Login.gov account nor an ID.me account, end the session.
3. 

## Share screen and login to LOA3 account (either Login.gov or ID.me) - 5 minutes
Great, thanks for providing that information. I think we're good to move ahead. For the next step, I'll have you share you screen so we can look at VA.gov together. 
_Once can see their screen:_ Could you now open a browser and go to VA.gov? 
_Once they arrive at VA.gov:_ Next, could you login using -------? (either Login.gov or ID.me)

## Closing - 1 minute
Okay, that's everything we were hoping to cover today. Thank you for taking the time to help us improve the VA.gov website. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it works well for Veterans.

Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
