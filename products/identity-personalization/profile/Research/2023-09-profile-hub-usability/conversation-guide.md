# Conversation Guide: Profile hub, [Month] 2023

## Moderator logistics

1. Start a thread in #[feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
2. Add the [research questions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2022-09-profile-editing-evaluation/research-plan.md#research-questions) to the session thread, and remind observers you’ll be asking them to post their top 3 insights from the session in the slack thread.
3. Send out the [observer instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Observer-guidelines.1622311177.html) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #[feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).
4. Mute your Slack notifications.

### Starting the session

- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- Keep observers in the waiting room
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your screensharing setup and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro – X minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Pam and [TBD] is taking notes. There are members from the website team who would like to hear your feedback firsthand during our session. Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with observers joining this session?

- *If participant does not consent, use Slack to ask the observers to leave the Zoom.*
- *If participant consents, admit observers.*
- *Introduce notetaker and observers turn on cameras to introduce them.*
- *Ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras and mics for remainder of the session to save bandwidth.*

Today we're going to take a look at the VA.gov website and ask you some questions. We’re interested in learning from you what it’s like to navigate and find information on the website.

---

**For AT sessions**: As part of signing up for the session, we asked if you need a screen reader to use the internet. According to my notes, you normally use [whatever participant has said]. Can you tell me more about that?

- Are you able to use that during our session today?

- That sounds good, thank you.

**For Magnification sessions**: As part of signing up for the session, we asked if you need magnification to use the internet. Can you tell me more about that?

- Thank you for sharing.

---

Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about XX/XX minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. To help us learn from your experience, please share out loud all of your thoughts and feelings.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- **I’m also going to turn on transcriptions to improve our notes; you should be able to control them on your end too.**

_Turn on transcription._

## Warm up – X minutes

Let's begin. How often do you use the VA.gov website?

**Think back to the last time you had to log into the VA.gov website to do something.** What did you need to do that required you logging in?

*If not-profile-related OR if someone cites going in person or calling:* Can you tell me about a time you had to update the VA with information about yourself?


*If profile-related:* Can you tell me more about your experience? Would you be up for logging into your account to walk me through what you had to update?

_Moderator: Download the transcript from zoom! Ask observers in the Slack thread to post their top observations._

That was everything I wanted to get your feedback on today. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! One thing to be on the lookout for - Perigean will be sending you something you can share to provide the opportunity to participate in research to other Veterans in your personal network. It’s so valuable for us to have the opportunity to include Veterans in our process.

## Emergency Exit

In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.
