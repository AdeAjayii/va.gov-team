## Overview

An executive order went out earlier this year that requires the VA to allow people to identify and update their preferred name and pronouns, gender identity, and sexual orientation. In June 2021, VEO came to VA.gov to talk about integrating this information into the VA.gov profile. 

## Problem Statement

- As a Veteran, I want to be able to easily manage and update my preferred name and pronouns, gender identity, and sexual orientation so that the VA has accurate information for me.
- As a Veteran, I want to be able to easily manage and update my preferred name and pronouns, gender identity, and sexual orientation so that I am addressed accurately in my business with the VA.

## User outcomes

- People have peace of mind that they will be addressed accurately and respectfully when interacting with the VA.

### Undesired User Outcomes

- If this information is not updated in all VA systems, it may result in some departments not having accurate Veteran data.
