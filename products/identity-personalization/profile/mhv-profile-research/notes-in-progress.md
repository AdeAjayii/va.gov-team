# MHV Notes (research in progress)
## Initial findings
### MHV - My Profile
- We probably don’t need these fields, but the MHV team doesn’t know much about how they’re used or how Veterans understand them. We need to learn more to confirm it’s fine not to move them to VA.gov:
	- `My VA Treating Facilities`
	- `What is your relationship to the VA?`
- Otherwise, `Notification settings` are the only new fields we definitely recommend adding profile to accommodate MHV users
	- All other fields in the “My Profile” section are rightly proposed for removal, confirmed for removal, or VA.gov is already pulling that data from MPI.
- `Blood type`  could be useful on the health information card, but probably makes sense in the health apt more than in VA.gov profile

### MHV - Download my data
- This whole section is going to the health apartment
- Do not recommend putting this in profile
- We can update links in My VA

### MHV - In case of emergency
- Need to learn more about this (MHV and Health apt perspective)
- This data is reviewed/updated when a person checks in for an appointment, and will be sent to VA Profile 
- Is this useful for people without health care to have on their VA record?
- Hypothesis: this belongs more with health preferences than a profile

### MHV - My Account
- Hypothesis: this whole section will become irrelevant once we drop the MHV credential

### MHV - Health information
- Need to learn more about this (MHV and Health apt perspective)
- this is the “print health care card”
- Hypothesis: this belongs more with health preferences than a profile

### MHV - My Links
- How much is this used?
- What do Theresa and Carnetta see as the usefulness of this section?
- Are there health apt plans for this?

### MHV - Pay or receive funds
- These are links; no data to move
- Some links are already on My VA
- Health apartment is taking care of the other links.
