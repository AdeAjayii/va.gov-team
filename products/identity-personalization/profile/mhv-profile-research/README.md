## Overview

With the health "apartment" work on the horizon, we need to figure out how to reconcile the MyHealtheVet profile with the VA.gov profile. This isn't as simple as moving over everything from MyHealtheVet into VA.gov; we need to figure out what data should move over, what data is or is not already supported by the VA Profile backend, and a strategy for making the transition.

## Problem Statement

Currently, MyHealtheVet has it's own profile while VA.gov also has it's own profile. With MyHealtheVet rolling into VA.gov as the health apartment, we have to figure out how to integrate the MyHealtheVet profile into the VA.gov profile so essential functionality is not lost.

## Research goals

Our ultimate goal is to come up with a strategy for how we should move forward with rolling the MHV profile into the VA.gov profile. In order to do this, we need to:

1. Determine areas of difference between the MVH and VA.gov profiles.
2. Determine if all fields in the MHV profile that are not currently in the VA.gov profile need to move over.
3. Determine the current status of work on the MHV profile, especially around backend support (note: all data is currently supported in MHV's backend, which is not accessible to us).
4. Determine stakeholder expectations for the the rollover of the MHV profile into the VA.gov profile.
5. Determine what MHV users need from the VA.gov profile in order to make it work for them.
6. Determine in what ways we can make the transition from the MHV profile to VA.gov profile less painful for users.

## Questions to answer

1. What data do we already have in the VA.gov profile that is also part of the MHV profile?
2. Of data that is not already in the VA.gov profile, are there data points that should not or do not need to move over? How can we determine this?
3. Given that all of the MHV profile is currently *not* supported by VA Profile or other backends, what work is the MHV profile team already doing to start to get their profile data into VA Profile or other backends?
4. Are there data points that are used by MHV coordinators in the profile? If so, what are the expectations around what access MHV coordinators will have to VA.gov profile data once we fully make this transition?
5. What might a strategy for starting to integrate some of the MHV profile data into VA.gov look like?
