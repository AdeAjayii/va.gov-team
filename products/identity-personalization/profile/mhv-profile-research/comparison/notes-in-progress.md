## Initial findings
### MHV - My Profile
- We probably don’t need these fields, but the MHV team doesn’t know much about how they’re used or how Veterans understand them. We need to learn more to confirm it’s fine not to move them to VA.gov:
	- `My VA Treating Facilities`
	- `What is your relationship to the VA?`
- Otherwise, `Notification settings` are the only new fields we definitely recommend adding profile to accommodate MHV users
	- All other fields in the “My Profile” section are rightly proposed for removal, confirmed for removal, or VA.gov is already pulling that data from MPI.
- `Blood type`  could be useful on the health information card, but probably makes sense in the health apt more than in VA.gov profile

### MHV - Download my data
- This whole section is going to the health apartment
- Do not recommend putting this in profile
- We can update links in My VA

### MHV - In case of emergency
- Need to learn more about this (MHV and Health apt perspective)
- This data is reviewed/updated when a person checks in for an appointment, and will be sent to VA Profile 
- Is this useful for people without health care to have on their VA record?
- Hypothesis: this belongs more with health preferences than a profile

### MHV - My Account
- Hypothesis: this whole section will become irrelevant once we drop the MHV credential

### MHV - Health information
- Need to learn more about this (MHV and Health apt perspective)
- this is the “print health care card”
- Hypothesis: this belongs more with health preferences than a profile

### MHV - My Links
- How much is this used?
- What do Theresa and Carnetta see as the usefulness of this section?
- Are there health apt plans for this?

### MHV - Pay or receive funds
- These are links; no data to move
- Some links are already on My VA
- Health apartment is taking care of the other links.

## SME Questions
### My profile
Is the data here auto populated from some other data source (e.g. MPI) once an account is matched?

Are there other places in MHV where “my treating facility” data lives?

### Coordinators
What will happen to the MHV admin portal once the Veteran facing side moves to VA.gov?

### Other
- [x] Look into “Download my Data” section and cross reference with VA.gov + health apartment plans
- [ ] “In case of emergency”, “Health care card”, “my links”, “pay / receive funds” - does health apt have plans for that?
- [ ] Reach out to Sylvia’s team at HRC
- [ ] Process notes from meeting w/ Nancy

## User questions
- How do you use the health information card? Does it make more sense in the health apartment or profile?
- Treating facilities
- Relationship to VA
