This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.
*The goal of this document is:*
* To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
* To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
* To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

### The sections of MHV Personal Information users find most useful are: Download my data, In case of Emergency, Change password, and My profile.
We started the session asking users to tell us about how they’ve used the personal information section.  6 of the 11 participants talked about using the following features. They were not the same 6 for each feature.
- Change password
- Download my data
- In case of emergency

Only 1 participant had a profile with only required fields filled out; the majority stated that while they don’t regularly visit the profile page, they had used it in the past to make updates. The most common reasons people had for visiting My profile were managing email notifications and changing their account security questions.

### People expect that VA has access to all the information in their profile, updates made in their profile would be available to VA and have some kind of downstream effect.

A resounding theme across all the data points discussed with participants was that they expected that VA has access to the information they entered into MHV, especially in their profile.  Only one participant expressed doubts about the VA having access to their MHV personal information section; this came up when we asked who could see the emergency contact information.
Participants also talked about the VA being notified about updates made to  sections of their profile, such as a change to their My VA Treating Facility section, and that they expected those updates would kick off a change on the administrative side of VA.

### People had varying ideas and levels of confidence about how data for “What is your relationship to VA” or “My VA treating facilites” is used by VA.

Our team has outstanding questions about these fields so we felt it was important to learn about the user’s understanding of them before we continue to dig in with stakeholders.  No participants were overly confused or bothered by the presence of these fields, but no one had a clear idea on what they were used for or felt they were useful for them to be able to change.

Participants speculated that the “What is your relationship to VA” checkboxes were there for a variety of reasons:
- Secondary insurance billing
- Understanding which VA newsletters a person may be interested in
- Verification purposes
- To provide services at a VAMC
- To know whether or not someone is a Caregiver using a Veteran’s account

Responses were slightly more consistent - related to records - when talking about the purpose of the “My VA Treating Facilities” checkboxes, but still varied. Our participants guessed that the checkboxes meant:
- These are where VA *could* have your medical records
- This is where medical records will be transferred if you select an option
- This is simply an acknowledgement that I go to this facility.
- This affects where I can receive care.
- This tells VA what market I am in (where I am receiving care).
- Unchecking and saving will discontinue service at these facilities.
- These are to update which facility records I can see in my blue button report.

The most important takeaway from these questions was that it’s not clear to users what these data points are for, and users don’t find them useful in their current state.

### The participants we talked to who receive care at multiple facilities have not experienced challenges related to being registered at multiple VAMCs.

We did some research in June 2021 to explore the value of adding preferred facilites to the VA.gov profile. Our findings in that study shows the ability of simply selecting a preferred or current facility from a list of registered facilities was not a useful feature to Veterans. 

In this round of research, we recruited participants who had been to multiple facilites in the last 18 months to validate those previous findings now that we’re planning for this transition.



### It’s important to Veterans to be able to identify and manage emergency contact information. 

### 1 of 11 participants had ever used their printable health information card; after learning about X of 11 thought it would be something they would use.

### All participants had never used My Links; X of 11 thought they might now that they knew about it.

### Probably a good idea to link items that overlap between healthcare and profile across sections. (E.g. link to manage Rx notifications in health care, pointing to profile)

### People are used to being able to change their password and manage accounts access via security questions - there’ll probably be a learning curve w/ how the new credentials work
