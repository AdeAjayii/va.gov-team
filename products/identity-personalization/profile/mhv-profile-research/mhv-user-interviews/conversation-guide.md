# MHV Personal Information Interviews - Conversation Guide
## Guide for note taking
Thank you note takers! Here's a breakdown of what we're hoping to highlight in this study, in terms of Veteran feedback:

- Which sections of MHV personal information are most useful to users, if any?
- How do MHV users use the fields `My VA Treating facilities` and `My relationship with VA`?
- How do MHV users use the health information card? 
- How do MHV users use the My Links section? 
- Where do MHV users expect to find health-related profile information? (Card sort)

If we have time, we’ll ask users for feedback on the VA.gov profile, and hope to highlight:
- How does the current profile meet the needs of MHV users?

## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Mute your Slack notifications*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.*

*Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.*

### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Make sure task-flow site links are ready to share
- [ ] Have Optimal Workshop links ready to share
- [ ] Make sure Mural data has been recorded, and that Mural is reset for each participant

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Liz, and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we’re going to talk about My HealtheVet, specifically - the personal information section. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **During this session, we are going to look at MHV and then do a sorting activity. You will need log into MHV and share your screen. This means we’ll see some personal information** Are you comfortable sharing your screen?
	- If no, moderator can log into a test account on MHV in staging and share their screen for participant review and commentary.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 2 minutes
1. I know you have a MHV account. Tell me how you use the personal information section of the site. 
	- *If needed:* This is where you’d find your profile, health information card, in case of emergency contacts, etc.
2. If you had to update personal information with VA, how would you go about doing that?

## Task 1: Review MHV Personal Info IA- 2 minutes
**Task description:**
- Now I’d like to take a look at MHV with you and get your thoughts on the personal information section of the site.  Can you go ahead and login, and then share your screen once you are logged in?

**Begin:**

1. Thank you! Let’s go to the personal information section of the site. (OK to guide navigation if needed)
2. Take a look at the sections listed under personal information - before clicking on anything, I’d like to know how you’ve used any of these sections before.

**Things to look out for:**
- Which sections is the participant already familiar with?

## Task 2: Review My Profile - 10 minutes
- Let’s take a look at the profile page - can you click on that link please?
- Tell me about how you use this page.
- Why are some of the boxes greyed out? 
	- What are your thoughts on why they are greyed out? 
- Which of these fields are important for you to be able to change?
- What are you surprised to see here? Why?
- Which fields do you have questions about?

Now there are a couple of specific questions I have on this page.
- Let’s review the What is your current relationship with VA field.  I see there are some selections there. How did those get there?
- How does this help you to be able to update this?
- Now talk to me about the “My VA Treating facilities” option. What is that for?
- How did those boxes get checked?
- How does it help you to be able to update this?

**Things to look out for:**
- Which fields are most important for the participant to change?
- Is there anything that confused or surprised the participant?
- Does the participant understand some of their profile is automatically filled out and not editable?
- What is useful about the My Relationship with VA field?
- What is the participants understanding of My VA Treating facilities?
- What is useful about My VA Treating facilities to the participant?

## Task 3: Review Health information card, My Links, and In Case of Emergency - 10 minutes

### Health Information card
- Now lets go to the health information card (OK to guide navigation)
- Talk to me about what you see on this page.
- Have you ever used this card?
- How might it be useful to you?

### My Links
- Now lets go to the my links page (OK to guide navigation)
- Talk to me about what you see on this page.
- Have you ever used this feature?
- How might it be useful to you?
- Who else can see your links?

### In case of emergency
- Now lets go to the in case of emergency page (OK to guide navigation)
- Talk to me about what you see on this page.
- Have you ever used this feature?
- How might it be useful to you?
- Who else can see your emergency contacts?

**Things to look out for:**
- Has the participant ever used any of these sections?
- How might they be useful to the participant?
- Does the participant expect that VA has access to their links and emergency contacts?


## Task 4: Card sort - 10 minutes
- Next we’re going to do a sorting activity on a different website. Let me send you the link.
- UPDATE CARD SORT LINK FOR PARTICIPANTS ([preview link here](https://p3y41d84.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/k3774wsz/sort))
* This is a tool that helps us understand how Veterans would group certain items. If we can understand how items are grouped, we can then organize them in an expected way. It is kind of like this, imagine you own a grocery store and you have a truck delivering a shipment of new products and you need to figure out the best place for everything in the store so that shoppers can easily find it. You might consider putting the cheddar cheese with other dairy products and a broom near the cleaning supplies.

* On the left, we have various cards with information you might recognize from the MHV pages we just reviewed. On the right you can drag items and group them together. If you do not recognize what something is on one of the cards, or need me to explain it a bit more, let me know.

* Instructions to open the card sort:
	* Go to the chat in zoom. It is located at the bottom of this zoom window and looks like a speech bubble.
	* Click on the link for the optimal workshop card sort.
* Organize cards in a way that makes sense to you
	* We will start at the top left and work our way through the cards, while we are moving them, help me out by “thinking out loud” so that I can understand why you might want to group things together.
	* I started a couple of groups for you, including one to place cards that don’t matter to you.
	* If there is a card that matters, but it doesn’t fit into any of the groups I made, you can create and name your own group.
* If participant created groups:
	* Talk to me about the group you made. What does it mean to you?

**Moderator notes:**

- We are not concerned with prioritizing cards within the grouping.
- What might the participant expect or suggest, based on their communications experience with other web pages/services?

## Task 5: review VA.gov profile - 5 minutes
Only attempt this task if participant seems to be up for it and there is plenty of time left in the scheduled session:

That was everything I wanted to make sure to get your feedback on.  I see we have a little time left, and there’s actually one other section of VA.gov I’d love to share with you if you’re up for it. It would take about 5 more minutes. Are you open to that?

Great! In that case, I’ll have you go to VA.gov (not MHV), and log in. 
Once logged in:
- Please navigate to the profile (OK to guide)
- Have you ever been here?
- I’m curious how this meets your expectations. Can you click around and talk to me about what you see?
- What is missing from this profile?
- What do you have questions about?


## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes

- Based on your experience today, is there anything you would like to comment on that we haven't discussed?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    **If Yes:** Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
