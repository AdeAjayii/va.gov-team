## Background
In order to support Veterans in the Starting Up and Taking Care of Myself phases of the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf), we need to define a strategy for how to move forward with rolling the My HealtheVet (MHV) profile into the VA.gov profile. 

In order to do this, we conducted research to better understand:
1. The similarities and differences between the My HealtheVet and VA.gov profiles.
2. The current status of MHV profile work and transition planning.
3. How MHV support roles (coordinators and help desk) use the MHV profile.
4. How MHV users use the profile.

Read [the questions we sought to answer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/mhv-profile-research/README.md#research-questions) and [our approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/mhv-profile-research/README.md#solution-approach) in our project outline.


## Recommendations
### Maintain important items that are already consistent between the two profiles.

### Move certain items from MHV to the VA.gov profile.

### Retire certain items with MHV.

## Additional points to think about
