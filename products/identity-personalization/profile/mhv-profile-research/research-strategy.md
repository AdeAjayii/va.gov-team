# Research Strategy for MHV profile <> VA.gov profile, March 2022
`Draft`
## Background
MyHealtheVet  (MHV) has its own profile, which is part of a larger Personal Information section. In support of the health apartment transition, we need to figure out which parts of the MHV Profile and Personal Information section need to roll into VA.gov and put together a strategy for how we might go about that work.

### OCTO Objectives 
This research supports the following OCTO objectives:
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

## Research Goals	
Through this research, we’d like to understand:
1. The similarities and differences between MHV and VA.gov profile and personal information section
2. The current status of the transition planning from MHV and VA.gov team perspectives
3.  If there are other MHV stakeholders we should talk to that we’re not already aware of
4. How MHV coordinators use the profile and personal information sections of MHV
5. How Veterans use the profile and personal information sections of MHV

### Outcome
Our ultimate goal is to come up with a strategy for how we should move forward with rolling the MHV profile into the VA.gov profile.  Our findings from this research will inform our strategy.

### Research questions
**About the profile/Personal Information section**
* What data do we already have in the VA.gov profile that is also part of the MHV profile?
* What data do we not already have in the VA.gov profile that should move over from MHV?
* What data do we not already have in the VA.gov profile that should *not* move over from MHV?
* Are there other sections of the “Personal Information” section of MHV that we need to account for in the profile?
**For the VA.gov identity team**
* Will we need to support the MHV credential after the health apartment transition?
**For the VA.gov health apartment team**
* What work has already been done on evaluating the MHV <> VA.gov profiles?
* What else should we consider as we think about how the VA.gov profile might change as it needs to support MHV users?
**For MHV profile team**
* What work is the MHV profile team already doing to start to get their profile data into VA Profile or other backends?
* What work has the MHV profile team already done to start planning for the eventual transition over to VA.gov? 
* Have they started talking about sunsetting the MHV profile?
* What does the MHV profile team know about how their users use the profile?
* Do they have analytics that we can look at?
**For MHV coordinators**
* How do MHV coordinators data from the profile and personal information section?
* What are the expectations around what access MHV coordinators will have to VA.gov profile data once we fully make this transition?
* How can we make this transition less painful for them?
**For MHV stakeholders**
* What expectations do they have around the MHV —> VA.gov profile transition?
**For MHV users**
* How do they use their profiles? Are there fields that are regularly used and others that are not?
* How do they use the other sections under Personal Information in MHV
* How can we make this transition less painful for them?

### Hypothesis
1. There are many fields in the MHV “My Profile” section that we won’t need to transition over to the VA.gov profile, because they’re not used by Veterans and MHV coordinators will be able to access that information in other ways.
2. We’ll be able to get analytics that will help us understand how often fields in My Profile are updated.
3. …

## Approach	
We’ll conduct this research over 3-4 sprints. Since we’ll have to rely on other stakeholders and partners to conduct our research, we’ll likely have chunks of this work that will start in one sprint and carry over into another. 

In the first two sprints (**Feb 23-Mar 23**) we’ll work toward research goals 1 and 2:
* We’ll conduct an audit of MHV’s Personal information section and compare it to VA.gov’s Profile.
* We’ll talk to the MHV team to learn what they’ve done so far with regard to the health apartment transition
**For the VA.gov health apartment and identity teams**
* We’ll schedule meetings and communicate asynchronously as needed to answer our questions (Sprint 1) 
**For MHV profile team**
* What work is the MHV profile team already doing to start to get their profile data into VA Profile or other backends?
* What work has the MHV profile team already done to start planning for the eventual transition over to VA.gov? 
* Have they started talking about sunsetting the MHV profile?
* What does the MHV profile team know about how their users use the profile?
* Do they have analytics that we can look at?
**For MHV coordinators**
* How do MHV coordinators data from the profile and personal information section?
* What are the expectations around what access MHV coordinators will have to VA.gov profile data once we fully make this transition?
* How can we make this transition less painful for them?
**For MHV stakeholders**
* What expectations do they have around the MHV —> VA.gov profile transition?
**For MHV users**
* How do they use their profiles? Are there fields that are regularly used and others that are not?
* How do they use the other sections under Personal Information in MHV
* How can we make this transition less painful for them?
