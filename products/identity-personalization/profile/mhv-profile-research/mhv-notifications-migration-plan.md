# MHV notification settings migration plan - DRAFT

Last updated May 13, 2022

## Overview

Per our [MHV profile audit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/mhv-profile-research/recommendations.md), we've determined that the only thing from the MHV profile that we need to move over to VA.gov are the notification settings:

This effort will involve the following:

- Adding the email notifications to VANotify
- Setting up the preferences in the VA Profile backend
- Migrating existing user preferences into the VA Profile backend
- Surfacing the preferences in the VA.gov interface

## Timeline for this work

We'll need to submit an intake form for VA Profile and discuss this work with VANotify to get on everyone's roadmap. As such, this work will not likely start for the next couple of months.
