## Profile Grooming Notes 9/14/2022:

- Does anyone want to look at the current sprint board? Any concerns about the workload or commitments? No.
- BAI completed and Accessibility tickets are the highest priority for upcoming sprint
- New FE developer will be joining the team (GCIO hire)

### Tickets Review
**Christina:**
Ready to conduct UAT on BAI
Documentation for connected apps

**Adam:**
Update contact info screen - BAI. Should be wrapped up today
Documentation
Accessibility
Alert
Flipping feature flags (super easy effort)

**Tom:**
Military Info
Documentation (may be done just needs to be reviewed by Sharon)
#46338 - military address bug, needs to speak more with Ian about this. Not sure if there’s anything for Profile to do, probably work for Ian’s team (not sure what team that is)

**Liz:**
No tickets

### Accessibility Discussion:

*Overview:* Conversation that has been ongoing for a year or so. Not just for Profile but across va.gov. Idea of editing one thing per page. Reducing cognitive load, helps low vision users, makes error handling simpler. Not 100% it's appropriate for Profile in all cases. Profile is already very simple so it could be a good use case to test this process. Address validation could probably benefit from this exercise. 
Do a study where we recruit people with cognitive disabilities, lower levels of education, people on mobile to see what kind of editing problems they have on Profile.
Do we have analytics that can help us see how often people are running into issues editing things on Profile
Example from the VAOS team - https://design.va.gov/patterns/help-users-to/complete-a-sub-task 
Have we heard any feedback from users on accessibility? No, most issues found were from our own teams. However, we’ve never taken users through complex flows.
Research to validate if we have any problems that need to be addressed
Next steps - Liz to do some research planning

### Accessibility Audit:
Defect 4 - would be a large effort on the engineering side but it comes up often in accessibility audits. This would also require some design effort as well. Sharon and Samara to touch base offline to discuss priorities. Samara is good with us prioritizing this over other work if needed.
