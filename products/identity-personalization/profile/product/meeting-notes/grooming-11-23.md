## Grooming Notes from 11/23

1. #49963 -  Fiduciary flag covers incompetent, deceased, or fiduciary flags that blocks the profile from the user. If we want analytics to track this, it's not possible right now. But we could check if the vet is flagged as incompetent, deceased, or fiduciary. We are not sure what the difference is between incompetent and fiduciary - **Sharon will confirm with Samara if is ok to track these scenarios separately since we canâ€™t track them as just one flag.** We may want to come up with a term for when a profile is blocked, (fiduciary does not seem to cover all these scenarios).
2. #49843 - Remove this and combine it with #46195 since John will be working on updating TTY code anyway, John will let us know in the comments if he finds any additional locations where the #800 is being used
3. Main focus this next sprint is on documentation as we want that wrapped up as much as possible before the end of the contract (12/16)
