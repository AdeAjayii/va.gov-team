Since I don't have an aggregated report to consolidate search results across profile pages, I can't determine the exact order of top search terms. However, these terms seem to have the highest counts across the profile:

- Health (personal information page only)
- Benefits (personal information page only)
- Direct deposit
- DD214
- Dependents

Thoughts

- Health and benefits - It's not clear if people expect to find additional health and benefit information for themselves in their profile (eg. eligibility, personal health care details, personal benefit details), or if these terms are just generally popular so a lot of people search for "health" and "benefits" from everywhere on the site. It's possible that this is not indicative of people expecting to find information in the profile, as ["health" and "benefits" are the top #1 and #4 search terms respectively for all of VA.gov](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-site-search-search-terms/a50123418w177519031p184624291/_u.date00=20201108&_u.date01=20211107/).
- Direct deposit - This has been a top search term from the profile even after adding direct deposit functionality, and it's not clear why. I wonder if there are people who expect to have direct deposit functionality but don't, or if this is the result of the many, many people who have access but can't edit their information from this page for a variety of reasons (eg. blocked routing numbers and anyone logging in with DS Logon or MHV).
- DD214 - It is likely that people expect to be able to access their DD214 from the profile. [As I mentioned here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/improvement-ideas.md), we should do more research on people's specific needs re: the DD214 and the profile. An easy win would be to link to DD214 information from here.
- Dependents - With the high incidence of search for "dependents" from the profile, it's likely people expect to see their dependents here.
