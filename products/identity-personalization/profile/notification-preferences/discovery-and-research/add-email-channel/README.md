## Problem Statement

Currently, the existing notification preferences we support all happen to only use text message as their means for getting in touch with users. However, we know that we'll soon need to support notifications that use email as a channel, and maybe some that support both text message and email as options. We want to do some research around how we can incorporate this additional option into the notification preferences interface so that we're ready to move quickly once this becomes a need for both users and stakeholders.
