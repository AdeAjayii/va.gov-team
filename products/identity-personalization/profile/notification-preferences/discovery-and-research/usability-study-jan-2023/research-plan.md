# Research plan for Authenticated Experience, Profile Notification Settings, January 2023
`DRAFT`

## Background
We know we will need to support additional channels and notifications within our Notification settings section in the near future. We already know need to make some design updates related to the input type and have better separation of notification items (research finding), but we’re not sure how the current auto-save pattern will work for users as the list of notifications grows, and new channels are added.

In order to make this determination, we need to get our existing pattern in front of users, with all the notifications we’re aware of today.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following 2023 OCTO objectives:
1. Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
2. Integrate the health portal features into VA.gov

### Veteran Journey
VA notifications cover a broad spectrum of VA services, and managing settings is something Veterans may do at any stage from Starting Up through Aging.

## Research goals
1. Understand how our single page, auto-save works for users when all known notifications are represented. 
2. Learn what information needs to be surfaced make the current settings and options clear to people.

### Outcome
This research will help us determine if we need to change our editing model in the next design iteration of our notification settings feature.

### Research questions
1. How easily are people able to find and interact with relevant notifications when there are more than 4 notifications, and multiple channels?
2. Does the auto-save functionality present any usability hurdles for people?
3. What information do people need to know about a notification to quickly understand their current settings and options?
4. Is there a difference in usability between mobile and desktop?

### Hypothesis
1. The current design will allow people to understand their options and read through the list of notifications with relative ease.
2. The auto-save function will cause minor confusion for some users because they want to be able press a button to confirm a change.
3. Users will want to quickly understand whether a setting is turned on or off, and by what channel the notification will be sent (email or text) without having to click on something to see it.

## Methodology	
This will be a moderated usability study conducted remotely over Zoom.

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
The audience for our research will be Veterans with VA health care with cognitive disabilities who are 55+.	

We’ll use Perigean to recruit participants.

### Recruitment criteria
We’d like to recruit 12 Veterans for a total of 6-8 completed sessions.

#### Primary criteria
All participants:
- Must be Veterans 
- Have received health care services at a VA Medical Facility within the last 12 months
- Have received a text message or email notification from VA
- Have an identified cognitive impairment

Some participants:
- Must require screenreader software to use computers and mobile devices (recruit 4 participants total)
- Must be over the age of 55 (recruit 8 participants in total)

#### Screener questions to target criteria not captured in the recruitment sign-up survey:
1. Have you received health care services at a VA medical facility (this could be at a VA clinic, hospital, or VA community care provider) in the last 12 months? 
- If yes, go to question 2. 
- If no, disqualify
2.
