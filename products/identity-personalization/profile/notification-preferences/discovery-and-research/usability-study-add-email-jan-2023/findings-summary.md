## Research Goals
_First, set the context of this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey. Explain what a Veteran might do before and after using this tool. What moments does this tool live in? Are there moments that matter to keep in mind? What are Veteran’s familiarity with tools like this? (do they use tools like this, or is this something new)._
_[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)_

_Then, describe your goals for this research_

## Methodology 

We conducted sessions remotely via Zoom, and asked participants to explore 2 prototypes through a few tasks.  

One prototype used our existing auto-save pattern, and another used a read/edit pattern similar to the other sections in profile.  We alternated which version we started with for each session.  Both prototypes had the same notification options available.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypotheses or tasks for this research along with the conclusions you found If you conducted a usability test, list the success or task completion rate._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)_

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_


## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

## Details of Findings 

### Our current auto-saved pattern worked well with additional channels and notifications, and all* participants preferred it to the read/edit pattern. 
- ***need to confirm it was indeed all participants.**
Participants were easily able understand and interact with our current auto-save pattern, even with additional notifications and channels. Clicking an edit link to update settings on a separate page felt like more work to participants.
> This is a lot simpler. It’s just easy, it just saves it and does it. I can quickly see that I don’t have it on and I can just turn it on” - P4

> ”It’s [the autosave page] a more streamlined user experience” - P1

 - The addition of an email channel, and new notifications didn’t introduce any usability hurdles for 8 of 9 participants.
	- **Confirm:** 1 participant felt overwhelmed by seeing things that weren’t relevant to them (BVA reminders).
-  **Confirm:**Most participants who saw the read/edit variation first suggested auto-save before seeing it.
- 1 participant wasn’t sure if the edit link would take them to edit their settings, or their contact information.
- This supports the findings from our [profile editing evaluation study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/Research/2022-09-profile-editing-evaluation/findings-summary.md) that a “one thing per page” approach is not ideal for the VA.gov profile.

> ”I don’t really like that [going to a new page]. I would really like to be able to click on and off the little bells [on the same page].” - P6

### No one got confused by the lack of a save button.
People felt confident that their changes were saved because of the feedback provided by the input message pattern.
> It said “update saved”— that’s some good information to let somebody with little to no vision what they typed was actually saved. - P10

> ’Update saved’ makes me feel like something happened. - P4

### The level of information provided about each notification was sufficient for most participants to determine whether or not they wanted to update their presence.
- **Confirm** 2 participants suggested additional information “on hover” to provide more context about notifications for less tech savvy Veterans.
- **Confirm:** Most notification group names and item names were clear and easily understood. 
- In both variations, it was clear to people whether or not their notification settings was on or off.

### Most participants intuitively navigated the path to add their email address. 
- Going between the notification settings page and email form was intuitive.
- One participant was surprised there was only one form field. Since the link said “profile” they expected to go to a page with their entire profile information.
- **Note/Question:** Some participants missed the “update saved” banner at the top of the page- did this impact whether or not they felt like their email had actually been saved? How many participants?
- **Confirm:** 2 participants expected to be opted in immediately, simply by adding their email address

### Most participants were not bothered by the repetition of the prompt to add an email address.
- **Confirm:** X of 9 participants didn’t comment on the repetition, and easily navigated the pages.
- Screenreader users were not bothered by the repetition of the links.
- **Confirm:** X participants commented that the page had visual clutter, and after adding an email commented that it was “better”. This suggests the repetition was clutter to them.
- **Confirm**: Some participants were not sure if the links under a notification name would only add the email address for that particular notification.

### Both variations of the design were equally usable on desktop and mobile.
- A low vision user commented that the green background to the “update saved” alert, which extends the full width of the section, was a “waste of vision time” on desktop because there wasn’t anything on the right side.
> “It would be better if the highlight didn’t go the full width of this thing and only highlighted the text. when I see it going the full width, I wonder what’s over there and it’s a waste of my vision time.”

### Some participants were confused about where their notifications were going to go.
- **Confirm:** X participants didn’t recall the mobile number information at the top of the prototype, and asked about how they could add their mobile number after adding their email address
- It’s possible this was confusing to participants because it was a prototype that didn’t reflect their own information.
- One participant thought the phone number at the top was a number to call for help.
> It has a phone number here I can call. - P9

## Additional Insights
### CodePen works well for HTML prototypes, especially when set the stage for participants.
