1/25/23

This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is **not the final result of working with the data discovered**. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes.

## Initial Findings

### Our current auto-saved pattern worked well with additional channels and notifications, and all* participants preferred it to the read/edit pattern. 
- ***need to confirm it was indeed all participants.**
- They were easily able understand and interact with our current auto-save pattern, even with additional notifications and channels.
- The addition of an email channel, and new notifications didn’t introduce any usability hurdles for 8 of 9 participants.
	- **Confirm:** 1 participant felt overwhelmed by seeing things that weren’t relevant to them (BVA reminders).
- Most participants who saw the read/edit variation first suggested auto-save before seeing it.
- It felt like an extra step to have to click the edit link, and then go to a separate page.
- 1 participant wasn’t sure if the edit link would take them to edit their settings, or their contact information

### No one got confused by the lack of a save button.
- People felt confident that their changes were saved because of the feedback provided by the input message pattern.
> It said “update saved”— that’s some good information to let somebody with little to no vision what they typed was actually saved. - P10

> ’Update saved’ makes me feel like something happened. - P4

### The level of information provided about each notification was sufficient for most participants to determine whether or not they wanted to update their presence.
- **Confirm** 2 participants suggested additional information “on hover” to provide more context about notifications for less tech savvy Veterans.
- **Confirm:** Most notification group names and item names were clear and easily understood. 
- In both variations, it was clear to people whether or not their notification settings was on or off.

### Most participants intuitively navigated the path to add their email address. 
- Going between the notification settings page and email form was intuitive.
- One participant was surprised there was only one form field. Since the link said “profile” they expected to go to a page with their entire profile information.
- **Note/Question:** Some participants missed the “update saved” banner at the top of the page- did this impact whether or not they felt like their email had actually been saved? How many participants?
- **Confirm:** 2 participants expected to be opted in immediately, simply by adding their email address

### Most participants were not bothered by the repetition of the prompt to add an email address.
- **Confirm:** X of 9 participants didn’t comment on the repetition, and easily navigated the pages.
- Screenreader users were not bothered by the repetition of the links.
- **Confirm:** X participants commented that the page had visual clutter, and after adding an email commented that it was “better”. This suggests the repetition was clutter to them.
- **Confirm**: Some participants were not sure if the links under a notification name would only add the email address for that particular notification.

### Both variations of the design were equally usable on desktop and mobile.
- A low vision user commented that the green background to the “update saved” alert, which extends the full width of the section, was a “waste of vision time” on desktop because there wasn’t anything on the right side.
> “It would be better if the highlight didn’t go the full width of this thing and only highlighted the text. when I see it going the full width, I wonder what’s over there and it’s a waste of my vision time.”

### Some participants were confused about where their notifications were going to go.
- **Confirm:** X participants didn’t recall the mobile number information at the top of the prototype, and asked about how they could add their mobile number after adding their email address
- It’s possible this was confusing to participants because it was a prototype that didn’t reflect their own information.
- One participant thought the phone number at the top was a number to call for help.
> It has a phone number here I can call. - P9
