This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is **not the final result of working with the data discovered**. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 

**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes.

## Initial Findings

### The majority of participants were easily understand and interact with our current auto-save pattern, even with additional notifications and channels.
- The addition of an email channel, and new notifications didn’t introduce any usability hurdles for 8 of 9 participants.
- **Need to check notes:** 1 participant felt overwhelmed by seeing things that weren’t relevant to them (BVA reminders).

### All participants preferred being able to update settings directly from a single page over navigating to a new page to do so.
- It felt like an extra step to have to click the edit link, and then go to a separate page.
- 1 participant wasn’t sure if the edit link would take them to edit their settings, or their contact information

### No one got confused by the lack of a save button.
- People felt confident that their changes were saved because of the feedback provided by the input message pattern

### The level of information provided about each notification was sufficient for most participants to determine whether or not they wanted to update their presence.
- **Need to check notes** 2 participants suggested additional information “on hover” to provide more context about notifications for less tech savvy Veterans.
- **need to check notes:** Most notification group names and item names were clear and easily understood. 
- In both variations, it was clear to people whether or not their notification settings was on or off.

### Both variations of the design were equally usable on desktop and mobile
- A low vision user commented that the green background to the “update saved” alert, which extends the full width of the section, was a “waste of vision time” on desktop because there wasn’t anything on the right side.
> “It would be better if the highlight didn’t go the full width of this thing and only highlighted the text. when I see it going the full width, I wonder what’s over there and it’s a waste of my vision time.”
