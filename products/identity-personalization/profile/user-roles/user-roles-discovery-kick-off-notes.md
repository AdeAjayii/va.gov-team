## Questions

> It is an OCTO/VA.gov priority that a new user role exist on VA.gov before the end of the year. 

Why does VA believe this user role needs to exist on VA.gov?

Where else do user roles exist in the VA digital ecosystem?

Why is it a priority now?

Why is the deadline before the end of the year?

> - Be able to define dependents' top priorities.

Who are dependents?

- I know dependents can be spouses and children. 
- Does VA recognize non-legal partnerships? 

What are the specific qualifications that make someone a dependent? 

What are all the benefits dependents can get?

What do we know so far about dependents' top priorities?

> The initially proposed MVP was that a dependent should be able to sign on and view their benefit letter. Do they care about this? Is this a good MVP? What is the most important thing a dependent needs to do?

Who proposed the MVP? Do they need to be included as a stakeholder in this research?

> We'll likely also want to quickly look into dependents' VA.gov accounts to asses what data they can already see and what they can't. 

Is Samara saying we should have dependents log in and go through the site as we observe them to learn this, or is there an internal VA way to understand this. 

- Feels like there is a risk of missing something if we only specify "dependents" as criteria without knowing what other parameters might influence what people can/can't see on VA.

>We should also make sure we understand how someone gets correlated as a dependent in the VA ecosystem. This is likely something we can learn more about through the eBenefits migration team (Jason Wolf), so likely not something we'd ask dependents about.

Ok for us to just reach out to Jason to get convo started?

> Where else on the site are dependents' already able to view data (eg. benefit letters, other edu info, etc.)?

Who can help us figure this out?

> One way to better understand dependent's top priorities is to assess what they already do online to manage their relationship with the VA (could be on sites other than VA.gov).

Do we know what other sites? Or is part of this work figuring out what other sites and figuring out dependent priorities? It seems like the best way to do this is a comparative analysis + interviews.

What deliverable from our team would make this collab successful?
