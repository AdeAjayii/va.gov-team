# Research Plan for Identity / Authenticated Experience, non-Veteran user roles, November 2021

## Background

As My HealtheVet and eBenefits move towards the VA.gov ecosystem, VA.gov will need to transition from serving exclusively Veterans, to serving a wider audience, such as caregivers, spouses, partners, POAs, VSOs, etc.

Currently, what defines a “non-Veteran” and their use cases are not well understood across the VA. Each administration—VHA, VBA, and NCA—has their own unique definitions and nuances, which significantly increase the complexity of solving for the “non-Veteran” use case. Delegates, beneficiaries, caregivers, and dependents are a few terms used interchangeably that encompass many different user types relying on many different products and services across VA.

### OCTO Objectives 

1. Consolidate pathways to sign on to Unified VA-wide Sign In Experience on VA.gov
2. Provide Login.gov as a credential choice for users
3. Ensure compliance with standards and legal requirements, including enforcement of multifactor authentication (MFA), document-based identity proofing, and accessibility

### Veteran Journey

This research is largely focused outside of the Veteran journey, given that we're seeking to learn more about non-Veterans.  The non-Veterans we are learning about may support Veterans through many stages of the Veteran journey, from Starting Up to Dying.

## Research Goals	

1. Understand the unique definitions and nuances each administration has for non-Veterans.
2. Define tasks each non-Veteran user type may need to complete for each administration.

### Outcome

This research will help us advance the authenticated experience in the following ways: 

- We'll be able to translate administration-specific user roles into a VA-wide set of unified definitions, which encompasses all user types / roles.  
- We'll understand the tasks non-Veterans need to complete on VA.gov.
- We'll be able to prioritize the non-Veteran user roles we can roll out on VA.gov.

### Research questions

1. What non-Veteran user roles does each administration serve?
2. What qualifies a person as a dependent?
3. What qualifies someone as a beneficiary?
4. How are those roles different, and the same?
5. What is the difference between POAs, CVSOs, VSOs, and claim agents, according to each administration?
6. What are the tasks that each user type may need to do?
7. What is a caregiver and what are the things that person needs to do for that administration?

### Hypothesis

What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Method	

We'll conduct semi-structured interviews with VA stakeholders over Zoom.

### Research materials

- [Link to conversation guide](url goes here) 

## Recruitment	

We're recruiting stakeholders at each administration through our VEO and OCTO colleagues, and reaching out via email to schedule sessions.

## Timeline

TBD

### Research sessions

TBD

### Length of sessions

Interviews will be 30-45 minutes.
