## Questions

### Across VA (not specific to an administration)

- What qualifies a person as a dependent?
  - Does any VA administration recognize a partnership that is not a marriage?
- What qualifies someone as a beneficiary?
- How are those roles different, and the same?
- Do you have to be a dependent to be a beneficiary?

### VHA

- Do people who have TRICARE use MHV? Including non-Veterans?
- "Survivors" are eligible for TRICARE - what qualifies a person as a survivor? Legal relationship? Former spouses?
- What health tasks are on eBenefits?

### VBA

#### eBenefits

- eBenefits - parents are handled differently according to [this doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/69833737d9fe22b8990bb987e7c50de13205c5d5/products/disability/declare-dependent/discovery/basic-product-evaluation.md#help-and-documentation----average). Learn more about that.
- Why are adopted children required to go through a manual review process when being added as a dependent?

### NCA

- Are there NCA related digital tools?
- This seems like it would be the most focused on non-Veterans, since the Veteran has passed when most of these benefits are used. True?
