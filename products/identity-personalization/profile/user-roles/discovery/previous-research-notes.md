# Non-Veteran user roles: questions and resources

**Last updated:** 10/11/2021

Capturing questions and resources that pop up as we explore documentation that exists related to non-Veteran user roles and tasks.

Screenshots and findigns captured in [this mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1633525573365/eeb43d10e07a7754128e175176c43bc00b43a883?sender=lizlantz1528).

## Questions

- What qualifies a person as a dependent?
- What qualifies someone as a beneficiary?
- How are those roles different, and the same?
- Do you have to be a dependent to be a beneficiary?

### VHA

- Do people who have TRICARE use MHV? Including non-Veterans?
- "Survivors" are eligible for TRICARE - what qualifies a person as a survivor? Legal relationship? Former spouses?

### VBA

- So far all questions have been answered :) 

#### eBenefits

- eBenefits - parents are handled differently according to [this doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/69833737d9fe22b8990bb987e7c50de13205c5d5/products/disability/declare-dependent/discovery/basic-product-evaluation.md#help-and-documentation----average). Learn more about that.
- Why are adopted children required to go through a manual review process when being added as a dependent?



### NCA

- Is there any kind of digital experience for NCA? Any digital tools?
- This seems like it would be the most focused on non-Veterans, since the Veteran has passed when most of these benefits are used. True?

### User roles / types

**Note:** I found a few useful persona documents on the VA Sharepoint instance, am not linking to them since they're on behind the network firewall. Screenshots are included on the [mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1633525573365/eeb43d10e07a7754128e175176c43bc00b43a883?sender=lizlantz1528).
