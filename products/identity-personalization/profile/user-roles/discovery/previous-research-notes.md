## Questions

### VHA



### VBA

- Do BVA appeals fall under the jurisdiction of VBA?

- > Veterans may be eligible to receive a higher compensation rate **if they are rated at 30 percent or higher and have one or more dependents, including a spouse, child, or a parent in their care**.

  But those dependents wouldn't need to/want to log in for anything related to this, would they?

#### eBenefits

- eBenefits - parents are handled differently according to [this doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/69833737d9fe22b8990bb987e7c50de13205c5d5/products/disability/declare-dependent/discovery/basic-product-evaluation.md#help-and-documentation----average).
