# Project Outline: User Roles and Permissions Research

---

## Overview
VA Office of the CTO Identity Team is working on the following initiatives:
1.	Consolidate pathways to sign on to Unified VA-wide Sign In Experience on VA.gov
2.	Provide Login.gov as a credential choice for users
3.	Ensure compliance with standards and legal requirements, including enforcement of multifactor authentication (MFA), document-based identity proofing, and accessibility

They need the Authenticated Experience team's assistance better defining what a "non-Veteran" role looks like and associated use cases.


## Problem Statement
Currently, what defines a “non-Veteran” and their use cases are not well understood across the VA. Each administration—VHA, VBA, and NCA—has their own unique definitions and nuances, which significantly increase the complexity of solving for the “non-Veteran” use case. Delegates, beneficiaries, caregivers, and dependents are a few terms used interchangeably that encompass many different user types relying on many different products and services across VA.

_How might we provide better definitions of non-Veteran user roles, and their use cases?_

## Desired Outcomes

- All non-Veteran user roles for VHA, VBA and NCA are defined as specific user types/roles
- What criteria does each user role need to meet in order to qualify for each user role, according to each administration
- The business definitions of the user roles (i.e. how VHA, VBA and NCA) are reconciled across eachother
- All non-Veteran user roles are defined from a _user_ perspective
- The business definitions of the various user roles are reconciled with the user-defined/understandings of user roles

Answering these questions will allow the Identiy team to better scope the technical solution for user roles and permissions.

## Undesired Outcomes
- Assuming that the business definitions of user roles will translate to users

## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*
