# Project Outline (Initiative Brief): User roles & permissions - Dependents user roles research & discovery
#### Overview

## Outcome Summary
Conduct usability testing/research to define the top priorities of a dependent user role. Initial thinking is that dependents need to be able to sign into va.gov to retrieve benefit letters. Our research should help validate, or invalidate this need, and ideally, identify if there are other potentially higher priorities that dependents may have in accessing an authenticated experience on va.gov. Ultimately this research will be used to scope what a dependent user role MVP looks like on va.gov.

## Problem
* **What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?** The suspected problem is that dependents don't have an easy way to retrieve benefit letters. However, there are a lot of unknowns about this. There are only "rumors" that dependents access va.gov for this purpose. We'll need to validate whether that is in fact true, and determine if there are other needs that are potentially more common or more important.

* **How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?**
This research would be done in direct service of several of OCTO-DE's mission and goals. For example, If we determine that dependents are in fact using va.gov to retrieve benefit letters, or there are other needs identified, the work would be done in direct service of providing a Veterans and their families a single source for information and resources. Additionally, depending on our research findings, this could point us in the direction of creating a more personalized experience on va.gov not only for Veterans, but for their dependents, as well any other future user roles that come out of this work, i.e. caregivers, POA's etc. This work also supports the goals of providing Veterans and their families with service that they trust (security, accuracy and relevancy); providing Veterans and their families with a seamless experience to apply for benefits and track applications, claims and appeals online.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks.*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - .
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - .
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - .
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - e.g. testing, marketing, compliance requirements

### Prioritization
