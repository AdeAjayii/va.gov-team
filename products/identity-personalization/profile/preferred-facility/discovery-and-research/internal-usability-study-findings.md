## Overview

We're building a new section of profile to add functionality to VA.gov profile to allow Veterans to set their facility preferences, which will in turn inform the list of options Veterans see when they use VAOS to schedule an appointment online.  Prior to conducting a collaborative study with the VAOS team, we wanted to do some usability testing to validate our overall design and get insights into how Veterans understand this section of profile outside of the VAOS context.

We ran 5 moderated sessions on Zoom with internal colleagues who are also Veterans.

## Findings

1. All participants easily found the 'Your profile menu' on the page. Only one participant expected it to be above the 'nametag' area of the screen, but still was able to navigate easily through the pages.

2. We uncovered a new use case: a user does not currently receive VA health care but is registered at VA facilities because they has received medical care through the VA in the past. 

3. 3 of 5 people assumed the facility list was sorted chronologically by most recently visited.

## Recommendations

- Move forward with our design for the study with VAOS.
- Consider adding content to address the scenario where someone registers with a facility but don't yet see the facility listed in their profile.
