# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience, Profile "My VA health facilities", June 2021

## Goals	

### What product & team are you doing this research for?	

Profile "My VA health facilities", Authenticated Experience

### Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The VAOS (online scheduling) tool allows veterans to make an appointment at all of the facilities at which they're registered, but veterans are frustrated because being registered at a facility does not mean they are currently receiving care there. Veterans are still considered registered at facilities where they used to receive — but no longer receive — care, and at some facilities for reasons other than having ever been a patient. Therefore, veterans see facilities in VAOS that they don't go to, and they do not understand why they are being asked to make appointments at facilities they don't go to. This has resulted in a considerable amount of complaints. 

Our MVP will add functionality to VA.gov profile to allow veterans to set their facility preferences, which will in turn inform the list of options veterans see when they use VAOS to schedule an appointment online.

User goals, business goals, and assumptions are listed in the [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/preferred-facility/README.md)

### Our approach

This section of profile is heavily linked to VAOS, and they're redesigning their flow to account for this new feature in profile.  The majority of the flow lies within VAOS, so this study will be led by the VAOS team.  Our team will provide research support in the following ways:

- Contributing to research plan and conversation guide
- Facilitating and note taking for some sessions
- Collaborating on synthesis

Link to VAOS research folder TBD.

### Questions we hope to be able to answer through this research

- How do Veterans talk about their medical facilities? What words do they use?
- Is “Your VA health facilities” meaningful or do we need to consider another name for this section of profile?
- How do veterans understand the message “Note: You're registered at 4 other facilities where you've received care in the past....”?
- Is it intuitive that unselecting a facility marks it as not current?
- How valuable is it to Veterans to be able to manage these facilities in their profile?
- How might they expect this information to be used outside of scheduling?
- Do we need any static content pages to support this section of profile?

- Do Veterans encounter any usability problems or confusion when going from VAOS to profile?
  - If a Veteran marks a facility as preferred or current in VAOS, and then visits their profile, do they understand why their facility list has a facility marked as current and others are hidden?
  - If a Veteran leaves VAOS to update their profile, what expectations do they have for going back to schedule their appointment?
- 

### Our hypothesis for this research
