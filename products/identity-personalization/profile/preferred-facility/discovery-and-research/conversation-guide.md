## Intro 

Thanks so much for joining us today! Today we're going to talk about a new section we're adding to profile on VA.gov.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session will be quick, it should take less than fifteen minutes.** 
- **As always, we want to hear your honest opinions.** 
- **Please go slower than you normally would and if you could talk aloud about what you are doing, that would be great.** 

## Screenshare

I'm going to send you a link to a prototype in the chat. 

Try to move a bit slower than you normally would on a website and talk me through your actions. For these scenarios we are going to assume that you have logged-in and navigated to your profile.

## Questions

**Scenario**

1. From here, can you tell me what you'd expect to find in each section of profile? 

*Q: is this referencing the side nav?*

2. Now, navigate to your health facilities. Take a look at this page and talk me through what you can do here.

   **Q: Since we're not really testing whether or not they can find it in this internal test, I think it's okay to lead them there. If not - how can I word this so that I don't lead them? The navigation label will be "my VA health facilities"**
  
  *A: Looks like the prototype defaults to this facilities section, is that intended? If not, and you want to start them elsewhere on the profile and have them go to the facilities section:I would go with something like "how  would you look at where you've received care?" or "how would you see what VA locations you've gone to?"*
   *Alternately, for something lightweight like this, you could just drop them on to the facilities section, and then just make sure to have a more robust flow when doing the combo study with VAOS.*

3. Can you show me how you would make changes to this list? 

*Consider if relevant to the functionality of the prototype/goals: "How would you add a VA location that's not here?" (get's at link at the bottom "how to add a new facility")*
**Add:** What do you expect will happen once you've made changes?

4. Now that you've saved some changes, talk me through what you see on this page.

### Things to watch for:

- Is “Your VA health facilities” meaningful or do we need to consider another name for this section of profile?
- Do people understand the edit button unlocks the whole group?
- Generally, do people understand how to edit their list? Did anyone think the `edit` button would only apply to the first facility in their list?
- Did it confuse people that unselecting a facility marks it as not current?
- How do people understand the message “Note: You're registered at 4 other facilities where you've received care in the past....”?
