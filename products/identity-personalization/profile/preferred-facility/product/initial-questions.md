> [Carnetta's answer] **VA Patients may select one or more VAMCs they are actively being treated at as many Veterans are medically treated at more than one VAMC.
> VA staff: MHV Administrators and Help Desk staff can see what the user selected as to where they receive treatment at for support and trouble-shooting purposes
> Future: MHV will pull VA Health data just from those facilities. Then under Blue Button Customize Report allow Veterans to select from a list of all their affiliated VAMCs to see VA Health data.**
>
> Where is MHV pulling/surfacing facility information for Veteran for this feature? [Carnetta's answer] **From MVI upon authentication**
> Where does MHV currently store these Veteran's preferences for this feature? [Carnetta's answer] **In their MHV account**
> We can also set up a quick call to chat about these questions as we do discovery for how to implement this type of feature on VA.gov.
