# Thoughts on next steps after Florence's 2023 military info discovery

### [2023 military info research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/military-information/discovery-and-research/2023-military-info-discovery/findings-summary.md)

## Top insights from the research

1. People would love to be able to view/download the DD214 online.
- I believe this was a known insight prior to this research, but it's always good reaffirm these things and validate that they are still true. Unfortunately, because the DD214 is in the purview of DoD, and because I'm genuinely unsure whether digital copies of it exist or not, this is not something that our team can implement. In fact, I think VA getting access to the DD214 at all would be a major effort well above the level of just our team, and could take a significant amount of time. 
2. People can not find their military info on VA.gov without guidance.
3. The most important things we could potentially add to military info in the profile are:

## What we could do vs. what we should do

What this research can't answer (nor was it necessarily intended to) is what *should* we do. We know a lot of things we *could* do based on the research, but that doesn't answer whether it would provide enough of a benefit to veterans that it would be worth the investment of our team's time.

So, I decided to check out the analytics to see what they say, and how they supplement Florence's findings.

What we can see from this report:

Overall, retrieving military information is a low-priority action compared to other tasks on VA.gov.

- The content page for [Request your military service records (including DD214)](https://www.va.gov/records/get-military-service-records/) ranks #89 in the last 6 months.
  - About 27% of visits to this page happen in a logged-in state. 
- [Military info in the profile](https://www.va.gov/profile/military-information) ranks #195 in the last 6 months.
  - About 90% of visits to this URL happen in a logged-in state, which makes sense since the profile requires users to be logged-in and identity-verified.
