# Military information: VA.gov can’t show any military information - user is not a Veteran
**Last updated: December 5, 2022**

For non-Veteran LOA3 users who sign in, go to the profile, and click into the military information section, we will show an informational alert that we don't have any military records to display.

## UX
* An LOA3 user goes to the military information section of the profile. If the user is a non-Veteran in our system, we will show an informational alert that explains they don't have any military information.
* Uses the  [warning alert component](https://design.va.gov/components/alert#warning-alert)  from the VA design system.

## How to reproduce
