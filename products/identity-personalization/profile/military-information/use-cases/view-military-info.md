# Military information: user wants to read their service history
**Last updated: August 18, 2022**

For LOA3 ID.me/Login.gov users who sign in, go to the profile, and click into the military information section, they can view their military history.

This page isn’t editable.

## UX
* A user lands on the military information page; they can see data points for all periods of service the VA knows about from their military record.
	* Branch of service
	* The month, day, and year they started with that branch
	* The month, day, and year they completed service with that branch.  
		* There are some instances where the end date will be blank.
* The page has an additional info component ([design system documentation](https://design.va.gov/components/additional-info)) with information in case the military service information doesn’t look right.
*  [Desktop mockup](https://www.sketch.com/s/59857eb5-d9f9-4145-99d3-d9a1de2d0655/a/OmlnY7p)
