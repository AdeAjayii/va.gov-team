# Military Information Use Cases
**Last updated:** August 18, 2022

For all of these use cases, the user must be LOA3 (identity verified). If the user is not LOA3, the only thing they can access in profile is the Account Security section.

## Common use cases
### User logs in with LOA1 account
- [User logs in with an LOA1 account](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/use-cases/loa1-user.md)
