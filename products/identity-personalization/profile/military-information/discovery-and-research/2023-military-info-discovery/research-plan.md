# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience - Military Info, Profile - January 2023

## Background
- The product currently offers the following info for those signed-in individuals for whom this info is relevant and available: military branch(es), period(s) of service, service start and end dates, contact info for addressing incorrect military info, and a link to request a DD214 "and other military records."
- We are capable of adding more information to this product, but we have unanswered questions about what users need from military info. The product is not new, but no discovery has yet been conducted to uncover answers about needs and usage of this information.

### OCTO Objectives 
This research supports the following 2023 OCTO objectives:
- Enhance Veteransâ€™ personalized online experience
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

### Veteran Journey
The profile overall, and the military info section more specifically, are associated with a broad spectrum of veteran needs and access to services.  cover a broad spectrum of VA services, and managing settings is something Veterans may do at any stage from Starting Up through Aging.

## Research Goals	
Given all the possible information that we could surface in military information, what would be most helpful to veterans?

### Outcome
This research will inform the product team on what and how much military information should be populated in each veteran's profile, and what other possible questions should be addressed in that same location, e.g. how to change incorrect service information.

### Research questions
- When and why do veterans need access to military information?
- Which information, if any, should be added to the military information already included in this product?
- When or why might veterans need to edit/change military information?
- When or why might veterans need to know what military information the VA has on them?
- What info might be helpful to veterans that are considering trying - or are working - to change their discharge status?

### Hypothesis
- Military information often (always?) must be provided when veterans apply for various VA benefits. This product could play a helpful role in the benefit application process.
- Veterans receive form DD214 - which includes all the information that this product could possibly include - when they leave the service. Duplicating DD214 information in this product could be helpful in the case of a missing or destroyed DD214.
- Veterans can request changes to the info on their DD214 if there has been an administrative error OR when the veteran successfully upgrades their discharge status. This product could help veterans determine if their military information is incorrect, if their discharge status could be upgraded, or if their discharge status has successfully been upgraded. 

## Methodology	
Semi-structured interviews that help us to understand what veterans need from this product without asking them directly about the product and what they'd expect the product to show or look like.
