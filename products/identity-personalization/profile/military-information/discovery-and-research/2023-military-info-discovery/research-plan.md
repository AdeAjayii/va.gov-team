# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience - Military Info, Profile - January 2023

## Background
- The product currently offers the following info for those signed-in individuals for whom this info is relevant and available: military branch(es), period(s) of service, service start and end dates, contact info for addressing incorrect military info, and a link to request a DD214 "and other military records."
- We are capable of adding more information to this product, but we have unanswered questions about what users need from military info. The product is not new, but no discovery has yet been conducted to uncover answers about needs and usage of this information.

### OCTO Objectives 
This research supports the following 2023 OCTO objectives:

Enhance Veteransâ€™ personalized online experience
Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

### Veteran Journey
The profile overall, and the military info section more specifically, are associated with a broad spectrum of veteran needs and access to services.  cover a broad spectrum of VA services, and managing settings is something Veterans may do at any stage from Starting Up through Aging.

## Research Goals	
Given all the possible information that we could surface in military information, what would be most helpful to veterans?

### Outcome
This research will inform the product team on what and how much military information should be populated in each veteran's profile, and what other possible questions should be addressed in that same location, i.e. how to change incorrect service information.

### Research questions
- When and why do veterans need access to military information?
- Which information, if any, should be added to the military information already included in this product?
- When or why might veterans need to edit/change military information?
- When or why might veterans need to know what military information the VA has on them?
- What info might be helpful to veterans that are considering trying - or are working - to change their discharge status?

### Hypothesis
- Military information often (always?) must be provided when veterans apply for various VA benefits. This product could play a helpful role in the benefit application process.
- Veterans receive form DD214 - which includes all the information that this product could possibly include - when they leave the service. Duplicating DD214 information in this product could be helpful in the case of a missing or destroyed DD214.
- Veterans can request changes to the info on their DD214 if there has been an administrative error OR when the veteran successfully upgrades their discharge status. This product could help veterans determine if their military information is incorrect, if their discharge status could be upgraded, or if their discharge status has successfully been upgraded. 

## Methodology	
Semi-structured interviews that help us to understand what veterans need from this product without asking them directly about the product and what they'd expect the product to show or look like.

## Recruitment	
OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
