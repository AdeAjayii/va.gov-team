## Overview

As of January 2023, the military information section of VA.gov only shows military branch(es), period(s) of service, service dates, information on how to fix data if it appears to be incorrect, and a link to the DD214. We have access to a lot more information [through our VA Profile integration](https://qa.vaprofile.va.gov:7005/profile-service/swagger-ui/index.html?configUrl=%2Fprofile-service%2Fv3%2Fapi-docs%2Fswagger-config&urls.primaryName=ProfileServiceV3#/Profile-v3) (note: you need to be on the VA network to view this link), but it is unclear what else we should surface here, if anything. We've never talked to veterans about this section of the profile, so we have little sense of whether it is meeting peoples needs and expectations.

Furthermore, with passage of the [PACT Act](https://www.va.gov/resources/the-pact-act-and-your-va-benefits/), there is renewed internal interest internally to surface more about veterans' miltary histories on VA.gov. While VA Profile does not support military health information -- a key componenet of the PACT Act -- it is possible that we could get other information (eg. deployment location) that might be helpful in signaling to people that they should check out whether they are eligible for expanded disability benefits.

In order to determine if and how we might expant the military information section on VA.gov, we need to conduct discovery to figure out what would be helpful to veterans.

## Problems

- It is unclear what information might be helpful to add, if anything, to the military information section of the VA.gov user profile. We have little understanding of users needs and expectations around this section since it's never been as high priority as work on other sections of the profile.

## Goals

- Determine how the current military information section does or does not meet user needs.
- Determine what information, if any, would be helpful to add to this section.
- Determine what, if any, information people might expect to see here with regards to the PACT Act.

## Project risks & challenges

- It may be hard to glean what people actually need. We don't want to be too leading since people tend to say they want whatever is offered to them. We should aim to be as generative as possible.
