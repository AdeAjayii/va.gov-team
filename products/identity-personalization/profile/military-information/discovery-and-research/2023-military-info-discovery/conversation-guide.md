## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Florence. 

Today we're going to talk about your experience obtaining and using your military service records. Before we move forward, I just wanted to check: (confirm that they have completed the task they selected in the screening questionnaire.)

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** 
- **In this session, there is no right or wrong answers.** I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we'll use the information you share to improve VA.gov. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording**. Okay, I'll ask you again so we have your answer recorded: Are you comfortable with me recording my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

To start off, I have some questions for you about your service history. Is that okay with you?
*Wait for consent to proceed*

1. What branch of the military did you serve in?
2. When did you retire or separate?
3. What keeps you busy lately?

## Accessing and using service history information - 35 minutes

4. Tell me about a time when you needed your military information for any reason. *If nothing comes to mind, prompt with examples, e.g. what about when you....*
5. When was that?
6. Where were you? *Are we talking about a digital form on VA.gov, a real paper form, at a VA location getting help from someone else?*
7. What specific military information was needed as a part of that process?
8. What did you do to obtain those pieces of information? *Have these details memorized? Have a go-to form or place?*
9. What would you have done if you couldn't access the information that way?
10. Tell me about another time when you needed your military information?
11. What are other situations you can imagine where you'd need your military information?
12. If I were to ask you for your military information now (date and place of entry into active duty, service start and end dates, last assignment and rank, condition of discharge), what would you need to do to tell me that info with certainty?

13. *If don't bring up form DD214*: What type of discharge paper did you receive retired or separated?
14. Do you still have the physical copy?
15. In what situations would you need to look at (that paper)?
16. Have you ever had to request a change to your (that paper)? 
17. If yes, when was that? How did you realize a change was needed? What was the change you needed to make, and why? How did you know
18. If no, do you anticipate ever needing to make a change? How would you check?
19. Has your discharge paperwork ever gone missing? If yes, when was that? How did you realize it was missing? What did you need it for?

## Expectations/hopes for finding service info - 15 minutes

Now, changing the topic of questions a bit:

20. Let's imagine that you could easily find your military information online, using your browser. _Pause._ What is your immediate response to that idea?
21. Would accessing your military information online be easier or more difficult than ________ (your current way of accessing that information)? Why?
22. Do you have any thoughts on where online you'd want to go to access your military information? 

We're about done, but for the last few minutes, I want you to share your screen and go to VA.gov. *Help with screenshare.*

23. Where might you expect to find your military information on this site?

*Help them navigate to profile: military info.*

24. Now looking at this, what is your immediate reaction?
25. What would you add to this page to make it more helpful to you? Why?
26. What would you remove from this page to make it more helpful to you? Why?
27. Anything else you might want to change about this page or its location on the site?

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

If a test participant shows signs of distress, take a moment to check in with them (offer to pass on the question, suggest taking a short break).

If they continue to give signs of distress, close the session:

"We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback."

After the session has closed, complete the ["Requesting emergency assistance" steps from the Emergency Exit Strategies document.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies)
