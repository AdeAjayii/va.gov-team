## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Florence. 

Today we're going to talk about your experience obtaining and using your military service records. Before we move forward, I just wanted to check: (confirm that they have completed the task they selected in the screening questionnaire.)

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** 
- **In this session, there is no right or wrong answers.** I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we'll use the information you share to improve VA.gov. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording**. Okay, I'll ask you again so we have your answer recorded: Are you comfortable with me recording my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 2 minutes

To start off, I have some questions for you about your service history. For some of these, you might not know the answer right off the top of your head, but that's fine. No need to go look up the information or anything. Is that okay with you?
*Wait for consent to proceed*

1. What branch of the military did you serve in?
2. When did you retire or separate?

## Accessing and using service history information - X minutes

*Ask only as much feels right. e.g. if they can't remember first couple questions, stop there and move on:*
3. Last entry date?
4. Discharge date?
5. Discharge type?
6. Military service number?
7. Any awards, decorations, medals, badges?
8. Do you have a VA service connected rating? If yes, what is your rated percentage?

9. For any of these questions, where would you go if you didn't know or wanted to doublecheck?
10. What would you need to do to access that?
11. If you didn't have access to that for some reason, where else could you go?
12. What would you need to do to access that?
13. In what types of situations would you need access to this information, besides perhaps this conversation?

14. *If don't bring up form DD214*: Do you also have a DD214?
15. Are there any other formal documents that you have received from the VA that might have the same info as the DD214? 
16. In what situations would you need to look at your DD214?
17. Have you ever had to request a change to your DD214? 
18. If yes, when was that? What was the change you needed to make, and why?
19. If no, do you anticipate ever needing to make a change?
20. Has your DD214 ever gone missing? If yes, when was that? How did you realize it was missing? What did you need it for?

19. Tell me about a time when you needed your service information for any reason. *If nothing comes to mind, prompt with examples, e.g. what about when you...*
20. When was that?
21. Where were you? (are we talking about a digital form on a computer or a real paper form, or someone else filling it out for you?)
22. How did you know this information was needed? (Was it a field on a form, did someone ask for the info verbally?)
23. And what specific information from your DD214 was needed?
24. How did you access the information?
25. Circle back: Tell me about another time when you needed your service information.

## Expectations/hopes for finding service info - X minutes

Okay, we're almost done with questions. Thank you for everything you've shared before. It's all really helpful information. Now, I want to turn our attention to the final 5 or so questions.

21. Let's imagine that you could easily find your service information online, using your browser. _Pause._ What is your immediate response to that idea?
22. Would accessing your service history information online be easier or more difficult than ________ (your current way of accessing that information)? Why?
23. Do you have any thoughts on where online you'd want to go to access your service information? 
24. If that information were on VA.gov, where on that site would you expect to find your service information? 
25. Would accessing your service history information on VA.gov be easier or more difficult than _______ (your current way of accessing that information? Why?

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

If a test participant shows signs of distress, take a moment to check in with them (offer to pass on the question, suggest taking a short break).

If they continue to give signs of distress, close the session:

"We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback."

After the session has closed, complete the ["Requesting emergency assistance" steps from the Emergency Exit Strategies document.](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies)
