## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Florence.

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about your experience obtaining and using your military service records.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** 
- **In this session, there is no right or wrong answers.** I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we'll use the information you share to improve VA.gov. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*
- **I have started recording**. Okay, I'll ask you again so we have your answer recorded: Are you comfortable with me recording my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
