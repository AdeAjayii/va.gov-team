## Research Goal
Determine which information would be most helpful for Veterans to have surfaced in the military information section of the VA.gov profile.

## Research Questions
1. When and why do Veterans need access to military information?
2. Which information, if any, should be added to the military information already included in this product?
3. When or why might Veterans need to edit/change military information?
4. When or why might Veterans need to know what military information the VA has on them?
5. What info might be helpful to Veterans that are considering trying - or are working - to change their discharge status?

## Methodology 
Live interview sessions were conducted remotely via Zoom, and at the end of interviews, participants were asked to share their screen (any device) to locate and review the military information section of the profile together.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
1. Military information often (always?) must be provided when Veterans apply for various VA benefits. This product could play a helpful role in the benefit application process.

*Mostly true* Most participants believed they needed to provide their DD214 to apply for VA benefits, but the type of benefit they're applying for and how they apply will determine whether a copy of their DD214 is actually completely necessary. Participants who applied with the help of a VSO most commonly remembered dates of service and branch of service as the service-related form fields that needed to be filled out as part of applying for VA benefits. There were mixed beliefs and/or experiences around whether one would need to provide a copy of one's DD214 to apply for VA benefits. 

2. Veterans receive form DD214 - which includes all the information that this product could possibly include - when they leave the service. Surfacing DD214 information in this product could be helpful in the case of a missing or destroyed DD214.

*Not always true* 1 participant out of the 10 interviewed has never received a dd214 and a review of Veteran Reddit confirms that some Veterans leave the survice without receiving discharge papers. 

3. This product - Military Information in the Profile - could help Veterans determine if their military information is correct or incorrect, if their discharge status could be upgraded, or if their discharge status has successfully been upgraded.

*True* Upon viewing the Military Information section of the Profile, 1 participant out of the 10 interviewed mentioned noticing a discrepancy in service dates and wondered if that could be getting in the way of receiving health records they had requested. In addition, participants mentioned confusions about their dd214s that could be clarified using this product, if the product is able to survace the pertinent information (especially as related to discharge codes and different versions of dd214).

## Key Findings
1. Most participants (at least 6/10) believe that they needed their DD214 (not just the information on it) to apply for any VA benefit or service.
2. Depending on how Veterans apply for VA benefits and services, they may or may not need to provide information about their service history and/or a copy of their DD214.
3. Though they may not *need* their DD214, having a copy of it facilitates application for VA benefits and for other non-VA veterans' privileges, memberships, and discounts. 
4. The most common service history related fields that participants recalled when applying for VA benefits were branch of service and service dates.
5. Veterans use service history information such as dates and locations to piece together timelines, which assist with applying for benefits to cover service-related injuries or to piece together the dates and locations of other events.
6. Veterans use service history information such as trainings, commendations, and position descriptions for professional reasons after the military, whether that is building out a resume or otherwise demonstrating qualifications for a role.
7. Some Veterans lack easy access to their original DD214. 
8. Participants like the idea of being able to access service history information AND their DD214 easily online. 
9. Unprompted, four participants brought up confusions they had about their DD214.
10. Participants do not think of the VA Profile as a way to access any information about their service history.
11. Participants are confused about the service dates that show up in the Military Information section of their Profile. 

## Details of Findings 

### Most participants (at least 6/10) believe that they needed their DD214 (not just the information on it) to apply for any VA benefit or service.
Those that thought they needed a copy of their DD214 to apply for a VA benefit had applied for disability (3 participants), healthcare (1 participant), a home loan (1 participant said the bank needed the DD214), and education benefits (1 participant seemed to need it when starting to apply online, but then ultimately didn't seem to need it when he went to a VSO for application help). 

The other participants (4/10) that did not bring up needing their DD214 to apply for benefits included those that did not mention applying for any VA benefits (2 participants), and those that applied for VA benefits but did so without their DD214 (2 participants). Of those that applied for benefits without their DD214, 1 participant never received a DD214 or any other discharge paperwork when she left the navy. When she applied for healthcare benefits, she went in person and got help with her application, and she was able to do that without requesting a copy of her DD214. The other participant who applied for benefits without a DD214 had applied for an increase in coverage from the VA and used a benefits letter found on eBenefits (not her DD214) to prove that she had been in the military. 

### Depending on how Veterans apply for VA benefits and services, they may or may not need to provide information about their service history and/or a copy of their DD214.
Based on the two accounts from participants of applying for VA benefits without a DD214 and some searching through common forms used to apply for benefits (specifically, VA form 21-526EZ used for applying for disability, VA form 28-1900 used for applying for VR&E/education benefits, and VA form 21P-527EZ used for applying for Veterans' pension), I can confidently assert that Veterans are not required in every case of applying for VA benefits to supply a copy of their DD214. That being said, proving one's military service in some way is a requirement for all benefits, and that may be done in some cases simply by giving the VA permission to gather that evidence on a Veteran's behalf. 

For common VA benefits such as healthcare, disability, education: If Veterans are able to supply their DD214 and/or service history information on their own without seeking help from a VAMC or VSO, the Veteran may be able to complete the benefits application process quickly online, from their own home. If they are lacking this information, they will need to take extra steps that may be time-consuming. The process of requesting a copy of one's DD214, for example, could take a month. Not supplying the information or document needed could result in the application moving much more slowly through the VA's review process. In other words, even if a Veteran can apply for a benefit without a DD214, having that one document does facilitate and expedite the process of applying for a VA benefit, as well as receiving a decision the application, and potentially eventually receiving that benefit.

### Though they may not *need* their DD214, having a copy of it facilitates application for VA benefits and for other non-VA veterans' privileges, memberships, and discounts. 
The finding just above this one provides some context for why it can be helpful to provide one's DD214 as part of the application process for VA benefits. There are other reasons why an easily accessible DD214 can be very helpful to Veterans. 

One reason is for those Veterans that have limited memory capabilities due to injury, as well as those Veterans that for non-injury related reasons may be unable to remember the exact dates of their service start and end, and other similar details about their service. When recruiting for this study, I did not ask Perigean to purposely recruit any Veterans with disabilities pertaining to memory. 2/10 of the participants interviewed mentioned as part of the interview that they had injury-related memory problems and had trouble remembering details such as service dates. Even though they didn't volunteer information about problems with their memory, a good number of participants said they had trouble remembering their exact service dates.  Another 2/10 participants discussed having their dates and other service history information memorized, but even those that believe they've memorized some of their information could benefit from some reminders: ""Some of the information, dates of service, are pretty much memorized. Awards I've received are pretty much memorized but training dates, those are not memorized. Different assignments that I've had over 26 years... [trails off]"

### The most common service history related fields that participants recalled when applying for VA benefits were branch of service and service dates.

### Veterans use service history information such as dates and locations to piece together timelines, which assist with applying for benefits to cover service-related injuries or to piece together the dates and locations of other events.

### Veterans use service history information such as trainings, commendations, and position descriptions for professional reasons after the military, whether that is building out a resume or otherwise demonstrating qualifications for a role.

### Participants are confused about the service dates that show up in the Military Information section of their Profile. 

	
## Recommendations
### Use the pattern in the auto-save prototype for notification settings as we add channels and notification options.
- The auto-save approach worked well for all participants. 
- The prototype replaced the radio buttons we have today with checkboxes. This was easily understood by participants and allows us to cut the number of inputs in half, resulting in a cleaner user interface.

### Learn more about content of My HealtheVet notifications, and update content accordingly to set clear expectations about what they are.
At this point, we don’t know exactly what each notification contains. We should get a better understanding of that, and update the names of notifications accordingly. For example: 
- “Medical images and reports” might set more clear expectations if it were called “New medical images and reports available”.    
- The My HealtheVet newsletter email notification channel may be more clear as “Subscribe to weekly newsletter” than “Notify by email”
-  Supported by finding “People were not totally clear on what to expect from notifications we’ll be bringing over from My HealtheVet.”

### Reconsider how we are encouraging people to add their email address to their profile.
We have an opportunity to reduce clutter in the UI and set clearer expectations about the 2 step process of adding missing contact information. It’s worth exploring how we might present this important call to action in a clearer way. 

### Explore how we might make the input message pattern more accessible.
The input message pattern design caused some problems people using magnification. We should look into how we might improve the pattern to reduce that friction and make the design more accessible for all.  Two ideas are to remove the checkmark icon, and reduce the width of the green background.

### Explore how we might surface meaningful and relevant links to people in the notification settings section.
We know that claim status is incredibly important to Veterans who have a claim or appeal in progress.  How might we give them easier access to that information from profile? 

As we expand the prescription shipping notification options, we should also explore if there’s a way we can make it easier for people to check whether or not the notification is relevant to them based on their pharmacy.

## Research Process Insights
### Our latest screener questions for assistive tech users and people with cognitive considerations were more successful than previous versions, but we still have room to improve.
We asked for 4 participants who require screenreader software to use the internet, and were able to recruit 3 who satisfied the criteria we outlined.

Once we got into the sessions, 1 of the 3 participants didn’t use screenreader software, but rather used built in Windows assistive technology. While this was useful to see, and we learned a lot from this participant, it didn’t quite meet the criteria we outlined.

Another participant stated that they checked “yes” to indicate they had a cognitive consideration simply because there was not a no option.  We later saw that the screener form offered participants a single radio button input for this question, instead of a yes or no.

*Above: the form used to recruit participants for this study. The first question is "Do you have an identified cognitive impairment", and has with a single radio button option labeled "yes".*

In our next study, we’ll provide people with multiple, clearly labeled options for special criteria may get us closer to talking to the folks who can answer our research questions.  We’ll include a “no” or something to negate the other options, as well as an “other” where people can type what they

### CodePen worked well as a tool for accessible HTML prototypes, and we learned ways to use it more effectively for future studies.
We set up our CodePen prototypes to mirror the accessible HTML we’d use on VA.gov, and found it to be a very successful way to get the research insights we hoped for across a variety of devices, assistive technologies, and skill level:
- 5 desktop participants
- 2 mobile participants
- 1 tablet participant
- 2 screenreader participants, one advanced, and one beginner
- 1 participant using Windows Adaptive technology and 400% zoom magnification

> I’m just impressed. As a screen reader, I’m going to say this form is very accessible. This definitely would be something that would be user friendly for anyone who is visually impaired. - P10, extremely low vision screenreader user.

We also learned ways we can improve the experience for future studies, and [captured them in this document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/discovery-research/codepen-prototyping.md).

## Further research needed
### We need to re-evaluate the use of the background-only banner to confirm a save at the top of a page, once people can use their real information.
This was the first time we tested our new pattern of having a dedicated page for updating contact information.  Most people didn’t acknowledge the update, and that may be OK if they see their own information reflected back to them once it’s saved.  We should re-test the existing pattern in a future study, with people’s actual information to get a sense of how important it is for them to read this confirmation banner.

### We should recruit for the underserved groups we didn’t get to talk to in this round in our next study.
Including these people in our next round of research will help our team get a diverse group of perspectives.

## Next Steps
- Review with product team and align on recommendations we’ll take action on.
- Share findings with the VA Notify and My HealtheVet teams.
- Create tickets for our backlog based on the recommendations.
