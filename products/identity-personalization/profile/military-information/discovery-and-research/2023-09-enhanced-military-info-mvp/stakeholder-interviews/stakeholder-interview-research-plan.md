# Profile Military information: ILER and TERA MVP - Stakeholder Interview Research Plan

`DRAFT`

## Background

## Research Goals

## Research Questions
1. Stakeholders have a hypothesis that surfacing 8 data points will improve the Veteran experience of applying for benefits. What is driving this hypothesis?
2. Is the current ILER PDF 508 compliant, at a minimum? If it is - is it actually usable?
3. What other teams may be interested in using this data if we add it to VA Profile?
4. _[this question may change/shift after desk research]_ What was the intended scope of the Booz Allen ILER HCD contract? What was the result of the prototype conversations? Why wasn't their vision for a customized ILER implemented (or implementable)?
