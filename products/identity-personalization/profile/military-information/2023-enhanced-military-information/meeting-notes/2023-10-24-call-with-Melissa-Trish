# Call with Melissa and Trish 10/24/23

## Summary

- We are holding off on the exposure piece for now for two reasons: 1) VA stakeholders in VBA/VHA need to agree internally on how we are surfacing data, and there is not total alignment on this yet. 2) We apparently don't have access to an ILER PDF, and there are discussions internally on how we can get computable data to surface. In a dream world, computable data would go to VA Profile, and we'd be able to access it there, but this is still only at the high-level talks phase.
- None of this stops us from expanding what we show for non-exposure military data, so we can still continue our work.

## Notes from call

- Internal consensus needs to happen around where and how exposure data is surfaced.
- This doesn't stop us from elevating any other data elements around military history. The point of contention across the organization is just around exposure data.
- Some of this tension has to do with what VA should be responsible for vs. what DoD should be responsible for.
- We actually don't have access to a PDF at this point, and DHA (part of DoD) needs to create an API for us to get the data in a computable format.
- Internally, Melissa and Trish would be like the exposure data to be part of VA Profile. VA Profile is integrating with ILER? What has already been agreed to is that VA Profile will consume ILER data if we can get it in a computable format.
- VA stakeholders across admins asking for a briefing on approach or examples. Conversations are happening at leadership level between central office, VHA, VBA. Samara might get pulled in to help clarify technical approach.
