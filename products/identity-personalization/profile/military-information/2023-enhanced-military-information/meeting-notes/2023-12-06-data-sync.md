# Military info data sync with AE Profile, VA Profile, and VADIR

12/6/2023


## Overall questions
#### How can we turn the  `DoD provided a value not in the reference table` responses into something meaningful for Veterans?
We’re seeing this value throughout the prod datasets we pulled for:
* Occupations
  * serviceSpecificOccupationCode / serviceSpecificOccupationText
* Deployments
  * deploymentProjectText
  * deploymentCountryText
  * deploymentLocationBodyOfWaterText
* Unit Assignments
  * militaryUnitCode / militaryUnitText

#### Why would some datasets be missing complete sections?
One set of prod data we pulled had nothing for occupations, deployments, or unit assignments

#### What data point can we reference to know whether a period of service was “active duty”, “inactive reserves”, “active reserves” etc? 
- We’ve heard feedback from Veterans that this would be a helpful datapoint for a period of service in their profile.
- Active duty is specified in a few places (under militarySummary and militaryServiceHistory) – which field “wins” when choosing to display the duty status?
- In the unit assignments data, `personnelCategoryName` + `personnelCategoryCode` seem equivalent to `militaryUnitTypeCode` and `militaryUnitTypeText`. Why isn't `personnelCategoryName` part of the schema too?

#### Why do we see `BioRetrievalErrors` for `adminDecisions`, `adminEpisodes`, and `prisonerOfWars`?
- What would an example of that kind of data would look like?  
- Would `prisonerOfWars` be a yes/no? 
- What might `adminDecisions` or `adminEpisodes` be describing? I reviewed the VA Profile: Military Personal docs  (sensitive) but didn't see it defined there

## Section specific questions

### Unit assignments
* These unit assignments have a sequence number, and each sequence number is repeated in the data twice. One for assigned and one for attached
* The sequence number does not seem to correspond to `effectiveDate` (which feels logical to me), so what does it correspond to?
* `assigned` and `attached` can have the same sequence number but vastly different effectiveDates , but the same lastUpdate value.  What does that mean?
* What does `lastUpdate` correspond to? This value is "The date on which the assignment record was most recently updated." - is it possible that would NOT correspond to the end date of that unit relationship?

In the email Daniel sent, they said:
> Military Unit Assignments are the code and name of the unit, group, squadron, battalion, etc. to which a service member is assigned during a period of service.  There can be multiple assignments to a unit per service episode.  There are tens of thousands units defined in the VADIR lookup table, but they are all very military service specific.  The services send unit codes very frequently that are not in the VADIR lookup tables.

The 526 form asks for the “current or last name and address of unit” as well as the phone number. What can we surface with regard to Unit to help Veterans answer this question?


### Military occupation
- In an email, Daniel shared:
> For each period of service of a Servicemember, DoD provides occupations to which the Servicemember was assigned during that period of service.  There can be many occupation segments per period of service. Occupations can be their Duty assignment, a primary skill, and a secondary skill (usually all three).  For each, DoD provides a very high-level standardized code that can be considered a standardized (across all services) parent occupation (i.e. Pilot or Electric Power Technician).  In addition, each service (i.e. Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, Space Force, and Coast Guard) have service-specific codes that go into much greater detail, but these codes are only relevant to the military service that reported the occupation. For example, 1021 = “Pilot, Helicopter”, 1031 = “Pilot, Search-Rescue”, 1041 = “Pilot, Transport”, etc.

The 526 claim form has one question about military occupation related to the PACT act: “Have you been exposed to any of the following?” And **MOS related toxin** is one of the options.  Would we expose `dodOccupationText` or `serviceSpecificOccupationCode` in order for the veteran to answer this correctly? Or both? Something else? 

* `serviceSegmentSequence` is the same for 23 entries. Why? What does that mean?
* The `effectiveDate` is the same for `occupationSegmentSequence` even when they are different numbers.  They are different when they are the same numbers. Can you help us make sense of this?
* These  have `occupationSegmentSequence`, and some are repeated twice. When this is the case,  one entry has`occupationTypeText: Primary` and the other has `occupationTypeText: Duty`. 
  * What does that mean? 
  * Are there other potential values?
* The sequence number does not seem to correspond to effectiveDate (which feels logical to me), so what does it correspond to?
* assigned and attached can have the same sequence number but vastly different effectiveDates , but the same lastUpdate value.  I don’t know how to make sense of that!

### Deployments
- Do we know the significance of `deploymentLocationTerminationReasonText` or `deploymentLocationTerminationReason` to the claims process, or to Veterans?
