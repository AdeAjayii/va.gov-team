## Overview


## MVP Goal

The MVP goal is:

- To holistically support the addition of toxic exposure fields into the 526.  

For the MVP, our work does this by:

- Making it easier for a 526 developer to incorporate these fields into prefill because we will have completed the original integration of this data into `vets-api`.
- Giving this data a permanent place on [VA.gov](http://va.gov/), so veterans can easily review this information.


### MVP Data Elements 

The MVP data points we're focusing on are tightly linked with the 526EZ application process. See the initiative outline for the larger list of data elements that will eventually be incorporated. 

1. dates of, and branches of, service (already supported) - incorporating active vs. inactive duty 
2. units with which the Veteran or Service member served
3. deployment locations and start and end dates of deployments
4. military occupational specialties

#### Disability claim (526EZ)
The online version of this form is being refreshed to match the paper version which asks additional questions around military information. With that in mind we're using this form to help prioritize the addition of data elements into the Profile that align with this form/application process. 

- [Paper form](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/VBA-21-526EZ-ARE.pdf)
- [Form on VA.gov staging](https://staging.va.gov/disability/file-disability-claim-form-21-526ez/introduction)
  - Access with user 15 or 68
