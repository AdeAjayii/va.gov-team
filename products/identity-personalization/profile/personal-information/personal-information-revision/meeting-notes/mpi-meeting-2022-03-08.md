#  2022-03-08 Meeting with MPI Team

## Attendees
- Samara Strauss
- Marci McGuire
- Tom Harrison
- Linda Reimonenq
- Jeff Kemple

## Notes
- Given the back-and-forth changes to the ADS, VA.gov Profile team is trying to determine if it will be faster to work directly with MPI instead of working with VA Profile

## Questions we need answered
- Is there additional paperwork? What would it take to get Tom up and running as soon as possible?
	- Jeff - Jeff Podolec & Danny instructed them to cancel the request and stop work
	- They don't have a blessed requirements document at this point
	- Would need to open a new service request and get that approved so they can officially assign resources - assuming it would be Jeff & Linda again - contractual requirement
	- Jeff K has not seen any comment from Danny & Jeff P instructing them to move forward with this again
	- Danny & Samara had a conversation about it, but that didn't make its way back to Jeff K, so let's get more explicit sign-off from Danny
	- Project was shut down and has to restart
	- Dave Hazelbaker (sp?) will be the point of contact for a new SR
- Is the API in production?
	- Jeff can't give an authoritative answer on that
	- Values being discussed were being put in place; Jeff believes they were released, but can't say with 100% assurance that they are there
	- Danny Reid can answer any back-end questions at this point
- Is there a testing/staging environment available to start working with right away?  If so, can you provide the connection information/steps?
- How is authentication handled?
- Is there documentation (Swagger docs) available?
- How are the following actions handled?
	- POST
	- PUT
	- DELETE
- Are all requests logged/audited?  Are logging/audit records available to us?
- Who will be the point of contact for testing/production issues?
- Does the API have any unique behaviors we should be aware of?
- Can they support logical delete with expired timestamp?
- Can that be done with all fields?
- How do they currently handle addresses for Veterans who are homeless?
- Will we be alerted when the API has a disruption in service?  If so, how?

## Action Items
- Samara will follow up on next steps in the email thread to confirm with Danny and Jeff P we can move forward directly with MPI
- Then we can move toward getting Tom's technical questions answered
