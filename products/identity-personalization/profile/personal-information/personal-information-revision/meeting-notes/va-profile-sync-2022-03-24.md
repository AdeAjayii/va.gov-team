# 2022-03-24 VA Profile Weekly Sync

## Notes 
- Meeting was recorded by VA Profile team
- Schedule - we don't understand some of the tasks in the project schedule - Barbie clarified
- Their code base should be on Staging on 4/8
- Target go-live is 5/3
- Lexi - we're not going to go forward with Sexual Orientation and Pronouns, but they won't be displayed on VA.gov until they go through the PRA approval process
- VA.gov is not going to connect the front end to the back end of Sexual Orientation and Pronouns until that approval happens
- Josh - Will VA.gov integrate with those endpoints now?  Samara - No
- Josh & Ian discussed possibly pulling the date in by leaving Sexual Orientation and Pronouns out of scope
- Barbie asked about the timeline for the PRA approval, but nobody on the call has that info
- It's possible this could fit within an existing exemption.  Otherwise, it's a onerous process
- Josh tabled sending us the spec until Ian finished hi - documentation is on INT env for pulls
- Tom should be able to retrieve that documentation
- VA Profile project schedule below.
