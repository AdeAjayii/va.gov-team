# Recommendations for updates to initial prototype

These are per our conversation with Amy Paris, who works with the Interagency Policy Committee on Gender Markers.

### Pronouns

- **Samara:** Ze/zir/zirs is optional but doesn't hurt. There are many variations of this set of pronouns, so we could take it out for clarity and trust that the open text field will capture all options, or leave as-is.

- **Danielle**: In previous research, statisticians and nongovernmental partners also noted that considering a smaller number of broader, highly accepted options can be helpful. This helps keep the list from being overwhelming, especially for folks who may not be familiar with some terms or may have limited English proficiency or cognitive issues. 

### Sex assigned at birth

**Samara**

TL;DR -- We should consider taking this out altogether unless it's absolutely needed. 

- Why are we collecting this information? It's worth noting the VA.gov profile only reflects this information, it doesn't collect it.
- That being said, what purpose is it serving?
- Is this more accurately "Sex listed on birth certificate"?
- We should also know where this comes from. Does this come from the DD214? If so, we should tell people to change it there as well. Where does this come from for non-veterans?
- In the end, this is probably up to us whether we show this field or not given that VHA does not own the VA.gov profile and the profile is not a health record.

**Danielle:** Previous research backs up that this question can be harmful to people who are transgender and people who are intersex (especially when required and when the only options are male/female). We've previously recommended not including (or at least not requiring) this field in other VA form contexts as well. Note that if we do keep this field as "Sex listed on birth certificate," we'll need to discuss whether the system can show options beyond "Male" and "Female," as some states now allow people to change their sex on their birth certificate to another option such as "X". So if a Veteran were to change their birth certificate to "X," we'd want them to be able to have that reflected in their VA.gov profile.

For discussion: To balance not including a field that may cause harm with still giving people a pathway to update their sex on record with VA (whether that's being pulled from their DD214, etc.), I'd love to discuss whether we could potentially not include the field itself but include instead a link to an FAQ on how to check/update this information.

### Gender identity

**Samara**

- We should strongly consider taking out "transgender" qualifer, as that could be used for discriminatory purposes if that information falls into the wrong hands.
- Options should be: Man, Woman, Non-binary, Prefer not to answer, A gender not listed here.

**Danielle:** This 100% aligns with previous research and with recommendations we've provided previously around this topic at VA. For background, the current Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) guidelines _do_ include separate fields. However, previous research brought up multiple problems with this. One is the issue of potential discrimination that Amy raised. Other issues raised include: 1) People may be confused and not answer in the way they intended (especially people with lower literacy or education level or limited English proficiency). 2) Separating "woman" from "transgender woman" or "man" from "transgender man" can be harmful in that it implies that a transgender woman (or man) is not a woman (or man). 2) Some people who serve and advocate for LGBTQ+ communities expressed concern that the term "transgender" can trigger negative, discriminatory reactions in some people and thus there's concern that specifically including this term could actually cause backlash against transgender people.

### Sexual orientation

**Samara**

TL;DR -- We should consider taking this out altogether unless it's absolutely needed. 

- What is this used for? How is it helping?
- If there is a valid reason, keep it. But if we do, there needs to be a super clear disclaimer to how this will be used and stored. Effectively, informed consent.

**Danielle:** This aligns with previous research re: value vs. burden and privacy concerns. If we do need to keep this, I'd love to talk about exploring whether we might include a) a check box or some way to encourage people to really read it and b) a phone number to call if people have questions before adding their info (thinking, for example, that in clinical trials "informed consent" includes a trial representative talking to the person to make sure they fully understand before consenting). And I'd love to also talk about doing specific comprehension testing on the disclaimer with people with limited English proficiency, low literacy, and cognitive issues if possible. 

### Samara's thoughts

- The VA.gov profile is not a 1:1 with health records, so what information is collected/presented on the health side of things is not necessarily what needs to be reflected in the VA.gov profile. We should not show any information here that is only necessary from a medical perspective.
- We should know how and why all of this information is being collected, and be responsible in explaining why we are asking for this.
