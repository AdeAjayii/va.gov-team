# Recommendations for updates to initial prototype

These are per our conversation with Amy Paris, who works with the Interagency Policy Committee on Gender Markers.

### Pronouns

- Ze/zir/zirs is optional but doesn't hurt. There are many variations of this set of pronouns, so we could take it out for clarity and trust that the open text field will capture all options, or leave as-is.

### Sex assigned at birth

TL;DR -- We should consider taking this out altogether unless it's absolutely needed. 

- Why are we collecting this information? It's worth noting the VA.gov profile only reflects this information, it doesn't collect it.
- That being said, what purpose is it serving?
- Is this more accurately "Sex listed on birth certificate"?
- We should also know where this comes from. Does this come from the DD214? If so, we should tell people to change it there as well. Where does this come from for non-veterans?

### Gender identity

- We should strongly consider taking out "transgender" qualifer, as that could be used for discriminatory purposes if that information falls into the wrong hands.
- Options should be: Man, Woman, Non-binary, Prefer not to answer, A gender not listed here.

### Sexual orientation

TL;DR -- We should consider taking this out altogether unless it's absolutely needed. 

- What is this used for? How is it helping?
- If there is a valid reason, keep it. But if we do, there needs to be a super clear disclaimer to how this will be used and stored. Effectively, informed consent.

### My thoughts

- The VA.gov profile is not a 1:1 with health records, so what information is collected/presented on the health side of things is not necessarily what needs to be reflected in the VA.gov profile. We should not show any information here that is only necessary from a medical perspective.
- We should know how and why all of this information is being collected, and be responsible in explaining why we are asking for this.
