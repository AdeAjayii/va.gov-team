# Research Plan for Authenticated Experience - Profile, Personal information UAT, April 2022

_DRAFT_

## Background
The addition of preferred name/pronouns/gender identity/sexual orientation fields within the Personal Information section of the VA.gov Profile aims to to mitigate issues around Veterans showing up to health appointments and being addressed improperly. These changes also allow veterans to more accurately describe themselves within the VA. For MVP, we will be including Preferred name and Gender identity, with Pronouns and Sexual orientation to be added once we have PRA approval for those fields.

See our [product brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information) for more details.

### OCTO-DE Objectives 
The addition of these fields should help fulfill our north star objective of helping Veterans to more accurately define themselves within the VA by allowing them to view and update their personal information so they have agency over how they're addressed by VA staff.
- Increase the quality and reliability of VA services
- Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features


### Veteran Journey
Since Veterans may need to add or update their information with VA at any time, **_this work impacts the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) from Starting Up and beyond._**

## Research Goals	
The primary goal of our UAT is to confirm that our Personal information section functionality works as expected and Veterans can view and update their preferences.

As secondary goals, we’ll follow up on our last [research study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/research/research-plan.md) and the subsequent changes made to the designs:
- We would like to evaluate whether Veterans understand the terminology used in the Personal Information section as it pertains to updating or changing their preferences.
- We would like to validate that the order of information makes sense to Veterans.
- We would like to evaluate whether or not Veterans understand what this information is and why we are asking for it.
- We would like to validate that Veterans understand it is optional to provide this information. 
- We would like to validate that no major usability hurdles have been introduced during the iterations that have occurred.

### Outcome
Based on the outcome of this research study, we will either release our MVP to production, or update our design to correct any significant usability hurdles or content/IA concerns people encounter.

### Research questions
- Does the functionality work as expected?
- Are Veterans able to update their Personal information preferences without any usability hurdles?
- Do Veterans understand what this information is and why we are asking for it? (FAQ)
- Do Veterans understand the terminology used in the Personal Information section?
- Does anything about the placement of these fields cause confusion?
- Do Veterans understand that these fields are optional?

### Hypothesis
- Veterans will be able to easily update their Personal information preferences.
- Veterans will not have questions about why we are asking for this information and where/how the information will be used.
- Veterans will not have questions as to whether or not this information is required.
- Veterans will not have strong opinions about the terminology used or order of the fields included.
- Veterans will not encounter any bugs in the Personal information section.

## Method	
We will be conducting remote, moderated interviews using Zoom. The sessions will be moderated using **_(staging? something switched on in production?)_**. We'll have participants go through a list of specific tasks for UAT, and then ask follow-up questions to get feedback on our content/IA related questions.

### Location
Remote, via Zoom

### Research materials
Conversation guide(link) 

## Recruitment	
Our intended audience for this research is BIPOC Veterans who are part of the LGTBQ community. We'll use Perigean to recruit them.

We'll focus our recruitment criteria on the marginalized groups we didn't speak with during our last [usability study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/research/findings-summary.md).

### Recruitment criteria

Please recruit 12 participants for 6 completed sessions.

#### Primary criteria (must-haves)

**All participants**

- must be LOA3 (identity verified) on VA.gov. **Participants will likely not know what this means, so please confirm this prior to testing.** 
	- This can be confirmed by having users sign into VA.gov with any of their credentials and having them go to the VA.gov profile. 
	- If they are prompted to verify their identity, that means they are LOA1 and they are not suitable for testing. 
	- If they can see any sections in profile **other than Account Security**, they are LOA3 and can participate in testing.

- must be able to screenshare via Zoom. Prior to the session, please confirm:
	- They're comfortable sharing their screen after they've logged into VA.gov.  Financial information will be viewable to the moderator and any observers.
	- They have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screenshare. 
	- **If they can not get Zoom working, there is no interview portion of this research and they will not be able to participate.**
	- **Qualifier:** Are you willing to share your screen with our moderator after you log in to VA.gov? The session will take you to a section of VA.gov where your VA financial information will be viewable. (Answer should be yes to qualify)

- Must be comfortable providing the email address they use to sign into VA.gov. We need this information 2-3 days before the study begins in order to give participants access to the prototype in production. **_(IS THIS THE CASE FOR US?)_**
  
- Must identity as part of the LGBTQ community

- Must identify as other than white or Caucasian

**Participant groups**

- 75% of participants should identify as other than male 
- At least 50% of participants should identify as having a cognitive disability
- At least 50% of participants should be younger than 55

Screener questions: (CHECKING WITH CINDY ON THIS - USE METHODS FROM HARASSMENT STUDY)
  
- _**This study involves reviewing a part of VA.gov that helps Veterans view and update information related to gender identity and aims to be inclusive of the community these updates aim to serve…..** Do you feel comfortable reviewing a website page that asks about this information? 
Do you feel comfortable updating, or sharing why you would not update, your own information?_
  - Answering yes to question **1** would qualify the participant for the study.

- 4 participants should regularly use zoom magnification tools and be able to participate on a desktop device. Screener question:
	- Do you use screen magnification tools (for example, ZoomText, fusion) on your desktop or laptop computer?
	- Answering yes would qualify the participant for the study.

#### Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)
##### Inclusion:
- 2 people who use assistive technology other than zoom magnification (such as screen readers, sighted keyboard users, hearing aids, or voice recognition)
- At least 3 Veterans living abroad (please work with researcher to coordinate time zones)
- At least 6 Veterans who identify as Hispanic, Asian, or Native
- At least 2 Veterans with other than honorable discharge
- At least 3 Veterans who have an immigrant origin

##### Geographic distribution:
- 4 participants from the east coast
- 4 participants from the midwest
- 4 participants from the west coast
