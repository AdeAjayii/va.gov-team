- Post in #feedback-backchannel
- Mute Slack notifications

## Intro - 2 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christina, and I also have a note taker and an observer with me. We're working on a new section of the Profile on the VA.gov website that helps Veterans update their personal information. The purpose of our session today is to make sure the feature is working as expected in your account and that you're able to interact with it as intended.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- There are a couple additional members from the website team who would like to observe the session and hear your feedback live. Are you comfortable with them joining the session? No pressure either way.

- **This entire session should take about 30 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your feedback helps us figure out how we can improve the Veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express. We're testing our work, not you, so you can't do or say anything wrong here.

- **We will be able to see some of your real information today.** During any of the tasks if you feel uncomfortable sharing your screen with any of your information on it, feel free to stop screensharing and start again when you feel comfortable.

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** I will stop the recording while you are logging into the site so we don't record your login information. We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, and the recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis. So none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
	- _If yes:_ **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

_Start recording._

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 3 minutes

_Confirm they qualify for the study._

- As part of the scheduling for this session, we asked if you have an identity verified account on VA.gov. According to the information I received, you do have an identity verified account. Is that correct?

- Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, or ID.me account?
	- _If they do not know what that means, ask:_ Do you ever sign into any VA websites, such as VA.gov, My HealtheVet, or ebenefits, to access or apply for your benefits?
		- _If no:_ I’m not sure we can proceed if that’s the case. Have you ever had to enter a username and password to access your VA benefits online or anything like that?
			- _If still no, end the session:_ Without that account access, we won’t be able to test this feature with you today, so I’m going to end the session. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate. 

- Do you know your username and password?
	- _If not:_ Are these readily accessible? Could you get them?
	- _If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, end the session:_ Without login credentials, we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.

- Great! I'll have you log in in just a second. 

- So today we’re going to observe you interacting with the new feature. Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen with me at this time? 

- Great! Thanks for confirming. In that case, please share your screen and then we will move on to the website and get started.
	- _If needed:_ You can do that by clicking the green button on the bottom of the Zoom window that says "Share Screen." It will then ask you which window you'd like to share and you can share either just your web browser where you'll be looking at the page we're testing or your entire desktop/background.
	- _If no, explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, end the call._ I completely understand. However if you're not comfortable sharing your screen for the session, we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.

## 1. Review Personal information section - 5 minutes

- So now I'd like you to open a new tab in your browser, and go to https://www.va.gov/. 
- Now you can go ahead and log in. I will stop the recording as you do that. _Stop recording_
- _Start recording._ Now that you are logged in, please go to your Profile by clicking on your name in the top right corner. 
- So we're going to review the Personal information section that appears here. And as a reminder feel free to think out loud as we go along. This really helps us get a better idea of your experience on the site.

#### UAT and Usability
- [ ] **UAT TASK:** _Confirm that they are LOA3. If they are not, they'll see a "Verify your identity" prompt. If they are not LOA3, end the session._ I see that your identity isn't yet verified. Because of that we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.
- [ ] **UAT TASK:** _If records can't be matched and an error appears, end the session._ I see that the system is unable to match your records. Because of that we aren't able to test this feature with you today so I'm going to end the call. Thank you so much for your willingness to participate; it is greatly appreciated.

If they are LOA3:
- Without clicking on anything yet, why do you think the VA asks for this information? 
- If you were trying to learn more about the information included here, where would you look / where do you think that would be on this page?
- Is this information required? Why does this seem that way?

	- _If needed:_ Did you see the sentence in gray under the Preferred name title of the section? 
	- How does or doesn’t this information answer your questions or clarify this?
	
- Ok, now this is totally optional, but if you are comfortable doing so, I’d like you to type in your Preferred name and save your entry. I do want to make it clear that once you enter information here, it can be edited but not fully deleted. So if you don't want to update this, you don't have to. Just let me know.
	- _If needed:_ You can just enter [YOUR FIRST NAME] so we can make sure this functions as intended.
	
- _If YES to question above:_ Is there anything about this process that is confusing?

## 5. (Optional if time) - Update and Refresh Page

Ok, now that we've finished all the tasks and have a little extra time, I have one more thing I like you to try.

- We're going to change your Preferred name information again and then refresh the entire page right away. We'll change your information back again once we've tried this.

- So first, could you please go back to Preferred name and enter something different? For example, you could enter [VERSION OF NAME]. 

- Great. Now go ahead and press update and then refresh the entire page by clicking the refresh button at the top of your browser window.
	- _If needed:_ This is usually a circular arrow in the top left part of your browser window next to the URL. 

- How did this or didn't this match up with what you were expecting to happen?

- Was there anything confusing about this?

- Great now let's go back and change the information back to [PREVIOUS ENTRY]

- Just to confirm - does the information you have entered now look correct?!
