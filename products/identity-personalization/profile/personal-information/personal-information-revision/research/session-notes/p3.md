**I'm going to have go through a few parts of this to help us understand if changes or improvements need to be made. Dont' click on anything yet but tell me your thoughts.**

****

Well it seems like it's to update my profile, or someones profile, and it gives you some updates to update your profile perfeed name (reads fields)

Uh, one thing I have a problem with is sexual orientation. Why does tht need to be added? Why should that be added? I figure if they say [says full name], well [says full name]is a [gender's] name, well I'm old fashioned I guess. You have to remember also that there's al ot of us old fashioned type VEterans and at the same time ther's a lot of younger veterans, I realize that. But the older generation is a more popiluspou group. There's a lot more older veterans than there are the younger ones. But the younger ones are catching up. II can understand why they hav sexucal oriantion but I don't feel comfortable with it. Because, uh, well, one thing, I'm gay. So, if someone sees that in my profile, they're automatically going to get a thought in their head and assume something. So, uh, that is the only thing that I really have a problem with.

**OK, so if you saw this in your own profile, what would you do?**

I would try and complain to somebody. I'm not going to fill something like that out, I don't feel like it's necessary.

**Based on what you see here do you feel like it's required for you to fill that out?**

It looks like it's required but I would still refuse or leave it blank.

**What indicates to you that it's requred?**

The blue edit button. It's saying you have to edit it because it's required. But like I said, I would talk to someone and say, listen, that's not a valid question because nowadays you're supposed to have the freedom to not have sexual orientation to discriminate against you. You know like if you file for a job or something like that, if you put your sexual orientation, you know, and somebody takes on an attitude of well [they're] gay [they] can't be trusted because the first [same gender] that comes along, they're going to run off with them. That's not the way we are, we're just like everybody else.

**Of course, I can see that it's concerning that someone could misuse the information**

Yes, that's what my thought is.

**Ok, well which of tehse sections are improtant to you, if any?**

Preferred name, that's the only one that's really important because (*shares story from childhood where he had to advocate to get people to use the name he liked*)

**What questions do you have about what you see here?**

To fill out the profile, personal information, I don't see any problem with. Contact information, that can change, I'm not in touch with my family so I don't have them as contact information. (*misunderstands contact info to contain emergency contact information. Continues to read down sidebar which is not relevant to this research*). Everything else looks ok.

**I'd like to get your thoughts on the different sections on the page. Go ahead and start with preferred name, and take a look of that and tell me what it means to you and what you'd enter into that field**

I would say [first name last name]. I don't use my middle name unless it's absolutely necessary for legal documents. That's all I would enter. Not a lot of people use their middle name.

**How would you expect that to be used once you saved that to your profile?**

That'd be used to identify me in the files. They'd check the army files and they'd find my name, DOB, SSN, which is everything that identifies me in the VA system. Like pronouns, I don't see any use of adding that to my profile. *Laughs* If they can't figure out at the VA what to call me, ma'am, sir, young man, whatever. Someone needs to get glasses *laughs*.

**Let's talk about those options. Click into that and let me know what you thnk about what you see there.**

If I have to click anything, it would be use my preferred name.

**Ok, and why is that?**

That's what I want to be called. I wouldn't want to be called he/his, they/them. What is zir/zirs? I've never heard of that before. *Sigh* Prounouns not listed here? *Sigh* Well I guess if someone is transgender. That would be a tricky situation. Not that I'm planning on doing anything, I prefer myself just the way I am.

**Sure, but you can understaand that'd be useful to someone in that situation.**

Yes, it can also be used detrimental to someone,

**How so?**

Well, don't get me wrong.
