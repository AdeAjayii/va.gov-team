# Research Goals

The information in Personal information fits in all stages of the Veteran journey, as Veterans may need to update their information on the VA.gov Profile throughout their lives. The information Veterans share in this part of Profile is particularly relevant for healthcare and especially applies to the Taking Care of Myself phase. 

Research focus:

* Evaluate whether Veterans understand the terminology used in the Personal Information section as it pertains to updating or changing their preferences.
Validate that the order of information makes sense to Veterans.

* Evaluate whether or not Veterans understand what this information is and why we are asking for it.

We will use the learnings from this research to determine if any content or IA changes are needed and refine our designs accordingly before we release this feature to Veterans.

We also made a recent change to the address update flow in contact information section of profile, and added a task to this study to evaluate how the new flow works for Veterans.


# Research Questions

Content/IA:
* Do the fields/information presented in the Personal Information section match Veterans' expectations?
* Does the wording of options presented in the Personal Information section match Veterans' expectations?
* Do Veterans understand the terminology used in the Personal Information section?
* What terms do Veterans use to describe themselves pertaining to gender, sexual identity pronouns, and names?
* How do Veterans expect to see this information organized on the page? Does anything about the placement of these fields cause confusion?
* Do veterans find that there are any fields or options missing?

Relevance/Privacy/FAQ:
* Do Veterans understand what this information is and why we are asking for it? (FAQ)

Address Modal Update:
* Do Veterans understand the modal prompts that appear after updating their home address?
* Do Veterans have any trouble following the prompts to update mailing address?
* What do Veterans expect to happen when the "Use my mailing address as my home address" checkbox is checked?


# Methodology 

We conducted remote, moderated interviews using Zoom. The sessions were moderated using a high-fidelity prototype showing different edit states to allow participants to respond to the options for each state. We were most interested in feedback regarding content and IA; ability to move through and edit the forms on Profile has already been tested in previous research.


# Hypotheses and Conclusions

* Veterans will understand how to update their personal information preferences
	* DEFINITELY TRUE
* Veterans will be pleased to have more control over how they are addressed when interacting with VA representatives
	* LIKELY FALSE 
* Veterans will understand the overall fields and options but may have different expectations regarding specific terminology
	* LIKELY TRUE
* Veterans will show confusion regarding specific terminology. We expect that some of the wording may be different than what they are used to.
	* LIKELY TRUE
* Veterans will have questions about why we are asking for this information and where/how the information will be used.
	* DEFINITELY TRUE
* Veterans will have questions as to whether or not this information is required.
	* DEFINITELY TRUE



# Key Findings

1. Participants are not confident their personal information will be used for their benefit.

2. Participants who identify as other than straight or cisgender found the sex assigned at birth and sexual orientation fields triggering.

3. Participants understand the terminology used, with some suggestions for additions or changes.

4. Participants found that certain elements of the UI/Design created confusion around the information and fields presented.

5. Participants who identify as straight or cisgender expressed that they would not necessarily use the fields themselves, but could see the usefulness for others.

6. Current IA (layout and order) contributes to participants' overall concerns and lack of acceptance of the Personal information section.

7. 4 of 5 participants missed the FAQs until pointed out by the moderator; once they read the content 5 of 5 participants felt the content didn’t fully address their questions or concerns.

8. 4 of 5 participants were able to easily understand how to update their home address to match their mailing address. Participants expressed varied opinions on the modals presented and the checkbox’s purpose. 


# Details of Findings 

### 1. Participants are not confident their personal information will be used for their benefit.

Participants shared concerns that this information could be used to the Veteran’s disadvantage, including that the Veteran could be judged and treated differently by VA staff.

> _“I don’t really understand why you would put sexual orientation other than data collection. When Trump came up with taking the surgeries away and health professionals can refuse rights. There has been a debate about medical care and if you put your sexual orientations you will have bias doctors. They may not provide the care needed.” - P8_

> _"If someone is non-binary, they're so far off the left or right, I mean, myself, I wouldn't take anything they said seriously." - P3_

> _“Younger veterans would think it was "cool" to provide this information, but without understanding the repercussions." - P8_

> _“I'm gay. So, if someone sees that in my profile, they're automatically going to get a thought in their head and assume something.” - P3_

Participants shared concerns about alienating Veterans, and believe more conservative Veterans would find some or all of the content objectionable.

> _“I’m just thinking about folks like my dad, who is a Vietnam Vet. And from discussions with him, I know that he would find these things at least mildly objectionable, simply because he’s from that generation.” - P1_

> _"There's a lot of straight-laced Christians who will definitely use that to someone's disadvantage.." - P3_

Participants' general perception was that the VA is gathering this information for demographic purposes and/or healthcare, but are not always sure the information will be used correctly/for good.

> _“Is someone really going to look at this before they address me to make sure they're using my correct pronoun?” - P13_

>_“So there’s two aspects of this, there’s the placement of the pronouns that offers the client the ability to identify the pronouns, and then there’s how comfortable they are with the concept that the healthcare provider is going to abide by those pronouns in a non-judgmental way. Because our healthcare providers are also bringing their prejudices with them.” - P1_

>_“There's a very real possibility that someone in the VA system would see that and automatically take up arms against them. They could do something detrimental to that person without that person realizing it. But you know, it's caused a ripple effect down to where it does hurt that person.” - P3_

>_“I don’t know about other places but in NC they will not let transgenders donate blood. It is almost like being discriminated against.” -P8_

>_“I mean going back up here and it says the factors can affect a person’s health, staff will use them when there. I understand the theory but there's a difference, they will have it vs they will use the information. Unless it is implemented by a standard or regulation it doesn’t matter.” - P8_


### 2. Participants who identify as other than straight or cisgender found the sex assigned at birth and sexual orientation fields triggering.

The participants identifying as gay or transgender expressed concern for the inclusion of Sex assigned at birth and sexual orientation. 

> _“Sex assigned at birth, I don't understand why that's there. That brings up a whole different bag of worms for people who are transgender. - P8"_

A transgender participant conveyed that forcing transgender folks to see sex assigned at birth is traumatic, as they see it as inaccurate information that they have worked hard to change. It also brings up thoughts about discrimination faced when revealing this information in medical setting. This participant also conveyed their own experiences facing medical discrimation due to this information. 

> _“Still keeping initial information on file and making you see it, then putting new stuff, almost like they aren’t accepting you.” - P8_

> _“I don’t know about other places but in NC they will not let transgenders donate blood. It is almost like being discriminated against.” - P8_

A gay participant repeatedly expressed his or friends’ experiences of sexual orientation information being used in harmful ways, and conveyed that not only would he not fill out the information, he would also call the VA and complain if it were listed on his profile.

> _“I would call someone at VA and complain [if I saw sexual orientation in my own profile].” - P3_

Overall, both participants felt that these respective fields would have negative consequences. Neither participant saw any benefit in including these fields.


### 3. Participants understand the terminology used, with some suggestions for additions or changes.

Suggestions for changes, additions, or removals included the following:

* Trans instead of transgender

> _“I would offer the suggestion that transgender tend to go by transman, its like wording. That’s the lingo in the community.” - P8_

* Missing gender fluid from gender identity list

> _“Gender fluid because some don’t want a category, it's just a different category of gender.” - P8_

* Missing asexual, pansexual, omnisexual from sexual orientation options

> _“Theres a ton of things out there but a sexual is one that’s not there, pansexual or omnisexual aren’t on there.” -P8_

* Remove heterosexual since we have straight, and homosexual since we have gay/lesbian

> _“Asexual is one that’s not there, pansexual or omnisexual aren’t on there.” - P8_

* A gay participant stated they felt the word “queer” is deragatory and “homosexual is old fashioned

> _“Queer. I hate that term. To me, queer means different, odd, not normal.” - P3_

> _"Homosexual is an old fashioned term. - P3"_

* Adding a title field could help amplify the selection made in pronoun

> _“..if we are going with pronouns, I prefer title like Ms. Mr. Miss. LtCol, etc. – the means of addressing. If you ask the pronoun then I would expect the title to be called.” - P6_

> _“I have had plenty of people call me ma'am.” - P8_

* One participant wanted to be able to identify their religious preference

> _“I would like to be able to make it clear with a very simple checkbox - which I was able to do on my military dog tags for 26 years - to just say 'hey I’m atheist.'... There’s a significant population in America who are atheist and for whom it is part of their identity.” - P1_


### 4. Participants found that certain elements of the UI/Design created confusion around the information and fields presented.

The label "preferred name" created confusion - 3 participants were unsure about what name to enter and how the entry would be used.

> _“I guess I am confused on what I am updating ... I would probably have given you my full name.” - P6_

> _“I would say [first name last name]. I don't use my middle name unless it's absolutely necessary for legal documents. That's all I would enter.” - P3_

> _“That'd be used to identify me in the files. They'd check the army files and they'd find my name, DOB, SSN, which is everything that identifies me in the VA system.” - P3_

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/research/images/preferred-name.png" width="50%" />

Participants expected a text input field in the Gender identity section for additional options.

> _“I would expect it to allow me to enter it if I don’t see it here so an option box would be good.” - P6_

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/research/images/gender-identity-missing-text-field.png" />

2 participants interpreted the fields as being required rather than optional. This was due to the Edit button in the read state, and the (Required) label within the edit state. Other participants were not sure. 

Participants gave the impression that they were apprehensive about the fields overall, because they felt they were being forced to respond.

> _“It says required in red. Unless it directly has an impact on my care or disability I don’t know why it needs to be shared, it should be an option.” - P13_

> _“It looks like it's [sexual orientation field] required but I would still refuse or leave it blank.” - P3_

> _(What makes you think it’s required?) “The blue edit button. It's saying you have to edit it because it's required.” - P3_

> _“Just looking here I don’t think it is required but since it has Edit I think it means I need to do something with it.” - P13_


### 5. Participants who identify as straight or cisgender expressed that they would not necessarily use the fields themselves, but could see the usefulness for others.

> _"I’m big on inclusion. I think you’re going to get some pushback on this from folks who are more traditional but I’m atheist so don’t have any religious hangups and in fact I'm a strong proponent of that aspect of our society. - P1_

> _“I understand why it’s [pronouns] there and I think it should stay, but it’s a personal issue. I will not update it because I don’t need to.” - P6_

> _“It is a lot of gender, assign birth sex and sexual orientation for just my personal information on the VA website. I understand why it may be useful, so I get it. It is okay, I just didn’t expect to see it.” - P13_


### 6. Participants shared concerns caused by the order of options within each section, and how sections were grouped together.

2 participants suggested alphabetizing items to remove social hierarchy. This came up most for Sexual orientation field, for which participants found the current order confusing or thought it might bring up concerns. 

> _“Would rather the options be alphabetical, so one doesn’t seem more important than others.” - P1_

> _“The order could be alphabetic or what the dominant is from most to least.” - P6_

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/research/images/alphabetize-sexual-orientation.png" width="50%" />

**The mix of editable and uneditable fields created a dissociation with the FAQs and triggered some participants.** 
This also contributed to participants not associating the information in the two FAQs with the corresponding fields (see finding 7), as well as contributing to concerns with the sex assigned at birth field (see finding 4). For participants identifying as other than straight or cisgender, the placement of sex assigned at birth mixed with the editable fields without context was triggering - something they were forced to look at yet could not change. 

> _“If I were going to lay this out, I would put it in such a way that the non-editable items were sectioned off together and the editable items were in one area. I would have sex assigned at birth along with date of birth.” - P1_

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/research/images/group-non-editable-fields.png" width="50% />


### 7. 4 of 5 participants missed the FAQs until pointed out by the moderator; once they read the content 5 of 5 participants felt the content didn’t fully address their questions or concerns.

Participants did not always notice the FAQs or did not associate the FAQs with the fields in question. 
One participant looked up and down the page multiple times, searching within the fields themselves, to find this information when prompted. It is important to note that participants consistently asked “Why would the VA ask for this information?” when looking at specific fields, rather than the page as a whole.

> _“The only thing I would offer is if it were my page and my DOB is wrong and there's no information on how to fix it I would be calling to see what’s going on.” - P6_

> _(Do you see anything on the page that can help answer your questions on why the VA asks for this information?) "No, there's nothing here." -P13_

![text](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/research/images/FAQs-corresponding-fields.png)

Participants did not feel that the FAQ content fully addresses their questions or concerns.
Once they had located the FAQs, 4 of 5 participants continued to express concerns for how and by whom the information would be used, making it clear that the information included did not sufficiently alleviate their concerns or answer questions, whether due to needing more information, such as specifics or examples, or simply not trusting the information provided. 

> _“It doesn’t quite answer the question but I can figure it out . . . I probably tend to say give me an example . . . Maybe a qualifier sentence like a link to learn more and that takes me somewhere with more depth about what I am bugged about if that makes sense. Just a learn more button would take me to more depth as to why something affects my quality of life.” - P6_

> _(Did the FAQ address your questions?) “It didn’t. I think it is more about collection of information and data points. I wouldn’t feel like it is about my care. It can just be a conversation with my provider.” - P13_

> _“I understand what they say here but it doesn’t tell me why they ask what you were born as.” - P8_

> _“Well, the people at the office that handle this kind of information, there needs to be a strict confidentiality clause for everybody to sign. First of all, everyone at the VA should sign one. Then they should make stricter ones for people who can share personal information. And really make strict and harsh consequences if they're caught using that information for personal gain.” - P3_


### 8. 4 of 5 participants were able to easily navigate the process to match their addresses. Participants expressed varied opinions on the modals presented and the checkbox’s purpose.  

4 participants had little trouble updating their information and were able to navigate through the reminder modals.

> _“Asking if I want to change mailing address and where they will send prescriptions and asking me to update mailing to match home address. That would make sense. I can see that it should be saved.” - P13_

1 participant had a difficult time locating the home address and began first with the mailing address, and did not understand the purpose of the modals.

> _(Referring to modal content) “Uh, well, it's obviously wrong, they still have both addresses, and it's asking me if I want to update my mailing address. And that's not correct if they have the wrong zip code. Clicks no” - P3_

4 participants thought the address would automatically populate when the checkbox was checked. 1 participant expected a modal pop-up showing his addresses next to each other for confirmation. 

> _“If I check this then the bottom piece could go ahead and auto populate with the address.” - P13_

> _(So if you clicked that box, and it was not a prototype, you would expect the home address to be the mailing address?) “Yes.” - P3_

> _“I would expect an automatic popup box. [...] I would expect it to be both mailing and home address beside each other.” - P6_

There were mixed responses for the use of the modals themselves.

* The majority of participants liked seeing the modal information prompting them to update their mailing address. One participant was confused by the modal and disliked it. 

> _“I think it is great to update both at the same time and you can do one section at a time instead of the whole thing.” - P13_

* Another participant felt people would click YES before reading and accidentally update the mailing address without intending to and suggested a 2-part modal.

* One participant mentioned that the information included in the first modal may be too much for one modal and recommended splitting it out. Similarly, a few participants went through the modals without carefully reading the information. 


# Recommendations

*Mockup of recommendations below*

1. Consider editing/updating FAQs to
	* mention the connection to/partnership with the LGBTQ Health Services to build trust from Veterans who are part of the LGBTQ communty as far as why the VA is asking for the info
	* include additional context/examples concerning how the VA will use this information.
	* point to privacy policies already in place for this information.
2. Consider utilizing hint text to help Veterans understand the value of sharing this information with VA.  - (Ex: “How would you like to be addressed at appointments, etc.”). This is also better for accessibility.
3.  Group editable and non-editable fields together and place related FAQ information within each section. This will benefit Veterans by removing confusion around the field types and providing important information for each section when it is most needed.
4.  Consider removing Sex assigned at birth field. If not possible, clearly convey where the information comes from, why it is included, and how to change it. (Ex: “This information comes from our ___ database. To edit this field…”)
5.  Consider removing Sexual orientation field.
6.  Consider removing transgender options from Gender identity field.
7.  Consider making changes that clarify editable fields are optional.
	* Add text clarifying fields are optional in hint text and section titles.
	* Add a Remove button (included elsewhere in Profile) to allow selection removal.
8. Alphabetize Pronouns, Gender identity, and Sexual orientation options to minimize misinterpretation that options are in order of  “social hierarchy.”
9. Add text input field in Gender identity section.
10. Consider adding Title and Religious Preferences as additional fields in future versions of personal information. Additional rounds of research can help evaluate whether or not this would be helpful to the Veteran population and VA.
11. For Address Change - Explore ways to slow people down so they take more time to complete this task and understand the implications of having a different home and mailing address. (Ex: Consider editing via “one thing per page”)

**Overview of Proposed Changes for IA/Content:**

![text](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/research/images/overview-proposed-changes.png)


# Next Steps

* Evaluate recommendations with product team.
* Work with Danielle Thierry to determine direction for content and IA-related changes.


# Further research needed

Findings do not include the perspectives from users of assistive technology other than initial accessibility feedback from designs/prototype.

Once design changes are made and on staging, our team will complete UAT with screen readers and ask additional questions related to ensure we have addressed concerns from this study.

This study was heavily weighted toward white male participants with master's degrees. In future studies, we would like to include more women, BIPOC, and folks who don't have a higher degree.

## Secondary research

Our team also consulted Amy Paris, who is our colleague through the United States Digital Service and works on behalf of the following groups:
* The USDS SOGI Data Discovery Sprint (Feb-Mar 2021) – Team Lead.
* The White House Equitable Data Working Group (EDWG), Sub-Group on Demographic Data Collection in Administrative Forms and Benefits Applications (ongoing work) – Chairperson. 
* The White House Interagency Policy Committee on Gender Markers – Co-Chairperson.


## Who we talked to 

**Recruitment criteria**

Our focus in this study was to speak with Veterans from the LGBTQ community. The study resulted in a 62% no-show/cancellation rate, 71% among Veterans in the underrepresented groups we were aiming to include: Veterans identifying as other than straight or heterosexual and Veterans identifying as other than cis-gender. This rate is something to note and look into to improve the recruitment process. Why were these participants more likely to cancel and how can we better recruit participants from these groups?
