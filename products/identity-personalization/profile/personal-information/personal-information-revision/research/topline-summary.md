This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**

- To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
- To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
- To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

**#1: Veterans are not confident their personal information will be used for their benefit.**

- Privacy Concerns - Participants are worried that this information could fall into the wrong hands or that those with access would make judgements/use the information to someone’s disadvantage
  
  > “I don’t really understand why you would put sexual orientation other than data collection. When Trump came up with taking the surgeries away and health professionals can refuse rights. There has been a debate about medical care and if you put your sexual orientations you will have bias doctors. They may not provide the care needed.” - P8
  
  > "Straight laced Christians who could use this to someone's disadvantage." - P3
  
- Concerns about Pushback/Alienating Veterans - Most participants believe more conservative Veterans would find some or all of the content objectionable.
  
  > “I’m just thinking about folks like my dad, who is a Vietnam Vet. And from discussions with him, I know that he would find these things at least mildly objectionable, simply because he’s from that generation.” - P1
  

- Participants' general perception was that the VA is gathering this information for demographic purposes and/or healthcare, but are not sure the information would be used correctly/for good.
  
  > “Younger veterans would think it was "cool" to provide this information, but without understanding the repercussions. - P8”
  
  > “Is someone really going to look at this before they address me to make sure they're using my correct pronoun?” - P13
  
  > “If it is used on the medical side they can help but it’s a double edged sword. In data collection and who is serving who and to improve it for management, then it would be more beneficial.” - P8
  

**#2: Veterans understand the terminology used, with some suggestions for additions or changes.**

- Trans instead of transgender
  
- Missing gender fluid from gender identity list
  
- Missing asexual, pansexual, omnisexual from sexual orientation options
  
- Remove heterosexual since we have straight, and homosexual since we have gay/lesbian
  
- A gay participant stated they felt the word “queer” is deragatory
  
  > "Homosexual is an old fashioned term. - P3"
  
  > “Asexual is one that’s not there, pansexual or omnisexual aren’t on there.” - P8
  
- Adding title could help amplify the selection made in pronoun
  
  > “..if we are going with pronouns, I prefer title like Ms. Mr. Miss. LtCol, etc. – the means of addressing. If you ask the pronoun then I would expect the title to be called.” - P6
  
- One participant wanted to be able to identify their religious preference
  
  > “I would like to be able to make it clear with a very simple checkbox - which I was able to do on my military dog tags for 26 years - to just say 'hey I’m atheist.'... There’s a significant population in America who are atheist and for whom it is part of their identity.” - P1
  

**#3: Veterans found that certain elements of the UI/Design created confusion around the information and fields presented.**

- Preferred name created confusion - participants were not sure what to enter.
  
  > “I guess I am confused on what I am updating. [...] I would probably have given you my full name.” - P6
  
- Gender identity - Would expect a text input field in Gender identity for additional options.
  
  > “I would expect it to allow me to enter it if I don’t see it here so an option box would be good.” - P6
  
- Optional vs required - A majority of participants interpreted the fields as required rather than optional.
  
  > “It says required in red. Unless it directly has an impact on my care or disability I don’t know why it needs to be shared, it should be an option.” - P13
  
- Lack of SSN or military ID fields raised questions
  
  > “I didn’t see the field for my SSN, or military id. EDIPI. The DoD number is different from the SSN. I question why it's not there.” - P6
  

**#4: Veterans who identify as other than straight or cisgender found the sex assigned at birth and sexual orientation fields triggering.**

> “I would call someone at VA and complain [if I saw sexual orientation in my own profile].” - P3

> “Sex assigned at birth, I don't understand why that's there. That brings up a whole different bag of worms for people who are transgender. - P8"

> “Still keeping initial information on file and making you see it, then putting new stuff, almost like they aren’t accepting you. - P8”

**#5: Veterans who did not identify as other than straight or cisgender expressed that they would not use fields themselves, but could see the usefulness for others.**

> "I’m big on inclusion. I think you’re going to get some pushback on this from folks who are more traditional but I’m atheist so don’t have any religious hangups and in fact I'm a strong proponent of that aspect of our society. - P1

**#6: Current IA (layout and order) contributes to Veterans' overall concerns and lack of acceptance of the Personal information section.**

- Suggested alphabetizing items to remove social hierarchy (this came up most for Sexual orientation field).
  
  > “Would rather the options be alphabetical, so one doesn’t seem more important than others.” - P1
  
- Suggested grouping uneditable fields together separately from editable fields.
  
  > “If I were going to lay this out, I would put it in such a way that the non-editable items were sectioned off together and the editable items were in one area. I would have sex assigned at birth along with date of birth.” - P1
  

**#7: 4 of 5 participants missed the FAQs until pointed out by the moderator; once they read the content 5 of 5 participants felt the content didn’t fully address their questions or concerns.**

- Participants did not always notice the FAQs or did not associate the FAQs with the fields in question.
  
  > “The only thing I would offer is if it were my page and my DOB is wrong and there's no information on how to fix it I would be calling to see what’s going on.” - P6
  
  > (Do you see anything on the page that can help answer your questions on why the VA asks for this information?) "No, there's nothing here." -P13
  
- Participants did not feel that the FAQ content fully addresses their questions or concerns.
  
  > “It doesn’t quite answer the question but I can figure it out. [...] I probably tend to say give me an example [...] Maybe a qualifier sentence like a link to learn more and that takes me somewhere with more depth about what I am bugged about if that makes sense. Just a learn more button would take me to more depth as to why something affects my quality of life.” - P6
  
  > (Did the FAQ address your questions?) “It didn’t. I think it is more about collection of information and data points. I wouldn’t feel like it is about my care. It can just be a conversation with my provider.” - P13
  

**#8: Participants were able to easily understand how to update their home address to match their mailing address, and how to update their mailing address to match their home address.**

> “I think it is great to update both at the same time and you can do one section at a time instead of the whole thing.” - P13
