## Intro - 3 minutes
-----------------

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christina and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about and look at a section of the Profile the VA.gov website that helps Veterans update their personal information. We'd like to hear your thoughts and get your feedback on this section of the site.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 to an hour (We have about 1 hour for this session, but it may be shorter than that).** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.

- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability.** We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.

- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. Do you have any questions about that?

- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
	- If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 2 minutes
----------------------------------------

Before we look at the prototype, let's start with a few warm-up questions.

- Could you tell me about your experience using VA.gov?
 
- Could you tell me about your experience updating your information on the site?


Receiving the Prototype Link and Sharing Screen - 3-5 minutes
-------------------------------------------------------------

Now we'll move on to the prototype. I'm going to send you a link in the chat and then have you share your screen.

*Send a link to the prototype, which starts on the Personal Information page.*

**Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)**

- In the Zoom application on your computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom.

	- Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat.
		- If don't see chat, ASK: Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
		
	- If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

Were you able to open the link and view it in the browser? Great. Now would you be able to go ahead and share your screen with me?

**Screen sharing instructions (if needed)**

- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer).
	- If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
	
- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" or your web browser.
	- Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.
	
- Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:
	- Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

Great! Now that we are all set up, I will have you move on to a few tasks.


## TASKS:
------

As I mentioned, we will be looking at a section of the Profile on the VA.gov website that helps Veterans update their personal information - in order to determine if the information makes sense and is presented in a way that is helpful for Veterans. I will have you complete a few tasks that will help us understand if changes or improvements need to be made.


Task 1: General Page Impression (Layout/Terminology) - 3 minutes
----------------------------------------------------------------

*Participant is on the Personal Information section page - fields say "edit your personal information to add your [info]"*

- Now, if you could take a look at this page, but please don't click anything quite yet. 

- Could you tell me your thoughts on what you see here? What can you do on this page?

- How does this page meet your expectations? How does this page not meet your expectations?

- (if not mentioned) What are your thoughts on the order of the information on this page?

- (if not mentioned) Did you notice that some of the fields can be edited? What are your thoughts on that?

- (if not mentioned) Did you notice the FAQs pertaining to what can be edited? Could you please go ahead and select this FAQ? How does this information help clarify what can be edited - or fall short in clarifying this?"

**Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant understand the meaning of the fields provided?

- Does the participant have any questions about the information presented?

- Does the participant mention anything about the order of the fields?

- Does the participant notice that some fields cannot be edited?

- Does the participant notice the FAQs pertaining to the information?


Task 2: Initial Navigation / Edit State - 2 minutes
---------------------------------------------------

*Participant is on the Personal Information section page - fields say "edit your personal information to add your [info]"*

- Now let's consider how you would update your own information on this page. When looking at this information, what would you choose to edit first?

- Great, thank you. Well, for the purposes for this testing, we will go in a specific order. Could you show me how you would first update your Preferred name?
	
- (When Edit State appears) How does this information that you see here meet your expectations? How does it not meet your expectations?

- So before we move forward, I do want to mention that the answers you will see have been pre-selected, so though you can make different choices, what you see later will not reflect your choices and will instead show what has already been filled in. Do you have any questions about this?

- Now, could you show me how you would complete this update?

**Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant have any questions regarding the order of the fields?

- Does the participant express any confusion with the name of the selected field?

- Does the participant have any questions about why certain fields cannot be edited?


Task 3: Remaining Edit States (repeat for remaining states) - 15 minutes 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Participant should be on Edit State for any field*

- (If not already on the main page) Now if you could return to your overall personal information to continue to update your preferences. 

- Next, could you show me what you would click on next to update your [Pronouns/name of field]?
	
- (When Edit State appears) How does the information you see here meet your expectations? How does it not meet your expectations?

- Are there any answers you'd want to use that you don't see listed here?

- Once again I want to mention that all of the answers have been pre-selected, so though you can make different choices, what you see later will possibly be something different that what you have chosen.

- Now, could you show me how you would complete this update?

**Things to watch for:**

- Does the participant understand the selection terminology?

- Does the participant note any options that are not listed?

- Does the participant have any questions regarding the input field for an answer not listed?


Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
-------------------------------

And that concludes the tasks we have for today. 

- Do you have any questions for me?


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
---------------------------------

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
