# Outline for Research Findings Presentation to VA

1. Team intro
2. Very brief overview of research
  - User research
  - Consulting with authoritative sources (note: still trying to figure out if we name Amy specifically, or if we reference one of the groups she works with)
3. Overview of the profile
  - Goal of the profile
  - Information we surface
  - Who we serve
  - Profile is an admin tool, not a health record. As such, some of our recommendations take the role of the profile into consideration.
5. Findings and recommendations
  - Veterans are not confident personal info will be used for their benefit
  - Sex assigned at birth is triggering to veterans who identify as other than straight or cisgender
    - **Recommendation**: We should not show sexual orientation or sex assigned at birth from the VA.gov profile given that our profile is an administrative tool. However, VHA should still collect and store this information as is necessary for medical history and records.
  - Terminology issues
    - **Recommendation**: For VA.gov, we should not be collecting metrics around whether people are transgender or not. Again, this is not necessary to know for administrative purposes, though we understand this will still be collected and would still be necessary for medical purposes.
  - Participants wanted to see a write-in option for gender identity
    - **Check-in**: Is MPI working on this?
6. Discussion
