# Draft Outline for Research Findings Presentation to VA
##	1. Veterans are not confident personal info will be used for their benefit

##	2. Sex assigned at birth is triggering to veterans who identify as other than straight or cisgender

   **From the health side, VA should still consider doing this since it is still valid info from a health perspective, but it is not really relevant to the VA.gov profile
   
##	3. Understanding terminology

  **A. Our recommendation is that we should NOT include sexual orientation at all because our web site is not a health record.  If the health folks collect it, that's fine, but we won't collect or display it.  It doesn't really give the Veteran any value in this circumstance.**

  **B. If we discuss terminology there is no need to include options for sexual orientation given the above**

 **C. If the goal is to respect people using pronouns, you could almost argue leaving off gender identity as well.**

  **D. For gender identity - we may want to leave that off also for the same reasons as sexual orientation and gender identity**
 
 **F. Although "queer" is going through a period of reclamation, there's value in having fewer options and/or having a write-in.**

##	4. Inconsistency between providing a write-in option for some option and not others 

##	5. Veterans who are not straight or cisgender express that they would not necessarily use the fields themselves, but could see usefulness for others
