## Purpose of this meeting
- Talk about research we did about proposals for VA.gov profile - what we showed people, feedback we got
- Meetings last couple of days have been more related to technical needs

## Agenda Review
	- Who We Are

## VA.gov Profile
- Samara presented the current capabilities and limitations
- Lexi commented it looked nice and clean
- Samara explained who can have a VA.gov profile
- Lexi asked if MPI also included all employees.  Samara said she believes that is true, as well as contractors
- Takeaway is that VA.gov profile is an admin tool and not exclusively health-related; this is an important distinction
- Lexi agrees and reiterated what she said in yesterday's call - we don't know where this info is relevant.

## Research Overview
- Christina presented the findings from the research study
- Lexi asked if participants were VA.gov users and how we found them
  - Yes, they are VA.gov users
  - We recruited through Perigean, our recruitment partner
- Christina presented the research goals
- Christina presented the information about consulting with Amy Paris
  - Lexi commented that her bosses are involved with two of the groups on that list
- Findings
  - Veterans are not confident that their information will be used for their benefit
  - Concerns about being judged or treated differently
  - Concerns about alienating Veterans
  - Older/conservative Veterans may object
  - General perception is this is demographic
  - Sex assigned about birth is triggering to those who are other than straight or cisgender
  - Expressed concerned about inclusion of sex assigned about birth an sexual orientation
  - Transgender participant conveyed that forcing transgender folks to see sex assigned at birth is traumatic and had personal experience related to discrimination 
  - A gay participant conveyed an friend's experience with misuse of sexual orientation info
  - Christina shared direct quotes from participants
  - Lexi confirmed that the quotes came from participants #3 and #8 and wanted to review their quotes.
  - Guidance from Amy Paris
  - While relevant in a clinical health setting, it's not relevant as administrative metrics
  - Key difference between VA.gov profile and VHA is dealing with Class 2 SIGI data
- Christina presented our recommendations
  - Recommend not showing sex assigned at birth
  - Recommend not showing sexual orientation
  - Recommend not including "transgender" as an option in the gender identity field
- Lexi's thoughts
  - She is fine with cutting sex assigned at birth, especially since it can't be changed
  - Sexual orientation - the whole reason they started working on this and paying for VA Profile was so that Veterans could provide that information directly without having to ask someone to do that.  It seems your participant was not interested, but there are people who are interested.
  - Lots of education is needed
  - We still live in a transphobic/homophobic world
  - We can include, but make it very clear that it is not required
  - They will be asked in the health care environment
- Gender identity is much the same
  - We can include, but make clear it's not required
  - They will also be asked about this in health care environment
  - Gender Harmony group has suggestions about the options presented, but unfortunately the VA environment is different.  If we took away those options, it might been seen as closeting people
  - They have SIGI info on millions of people and that could have negative effects
  - Summary - not including these options are not the right solution to Amy
- Danielle's feedback
  - She and Lexi have talked a few different times, and Danielle keeps coming back to the fact that guidance is still evolving.  We still need to keep talking through and relying on folks like Amy who is working with these inter-agency groups like Gender Harmony project
  - Concern about this being administrative and outside health info context is key here. Lexi advised they had a meeting with the Gender Harmony project expects that agencies would include these options
  - Next piece is that the 10-10EZ is administrative as well, and SIGI options are already on that document
  - She hears the distinction, but we are already blurring that
  - Danielle - our goal is to honor the privacy and be respectful of how people identify themselves.  Privacy aspects are becoming a little more clear, and how we might go about that
  - Lexi - there is also the education piece - how do we tell people their info is protected and how it is put to use.  Assumes that none of these folks have been told that it's good to share this.  Many have probably had experiences where it's bad to share it.
  - Danielle - one of the really interesting pieces is balancing understanding needs and connecting that back to a particular person. How we understand the population we serve without connecting back to particular individuals.  It's a deeper and complex conversation that probably needs a lot of follow-up
  - How does that work with our work?
  - Samara - taking out sex assigned at birth is something we all agree can be taken out now
  - If someone has already provided gender identity, it makes sense not to take that away
  - Sexual orientation is tough -- we are getting different guidance on different sides on how to proceed.  There is an option to keep it in and heavily caveat that people do not have to provide.  We can work with Lexi on how we word that.
  - Danielle- that education piece also includes how we are protecting it and storing it.  We have a resources & support area on VA.gov that allows us to dig into these deeper questions that we want to answer that goes beyond an FAQ
  - Samara -  agree.  
  - Lexi - and one of the response options is "do not wish to answer"
  - Lexi - the world is changing, period.  Most medical folks didn't get training on this in school, and yet we have a president who is interested in making sure that LGBTQ+ Veterans are well taken care of.  Question is whether people will like what we are doing, and chances are they won't.   Every voice is valid, but what will their voices look like in two years when they or their peers have seen benefit from this
- Last Finding
  - Participants want to see a write-in option for gender identify similar to pronouns
  - They'd expect a text input for additional options
  - Is an open text option being added to MPI, and if so, we'd recommend.
  - Lexi - Cerner has one, MPI does not, but we would make sure that one would be one if the Cerner option becomes part of MPI.  If the authoritative data source (ADS) switches, we will make sure that is included.  Otherwise, would need $193k to make this happen, which we should have in a couple of years. 
  - Net-net - if the ADS, that would happen quickly, but otherwise, a couple of years.
  - Samara - so VA  Profile could have a text option?  Lexi - yes, if VA Profile becomes the ADS.  Samara - we will follow up on that
  - Should sexual orientation be multi-select?  Yes.
  - Should gender identity be multi-select? It currently is on one system, but not the other.  If VA Profile will be the ADS, then we can make it whatever we want.
