Research Plan for Profile Team, Personal Information, November 2021
===================================================================

Background
----------

The Personal Information section of the VA.gov Profile, previously part of the Personal and Contact Information section, was created to mitigate issues around Veterans showing up to health appointments and being addressed improperly, causing distress to both patients and staff who are working with inaccurate and outdated information.

We recently expanded the personal information section to include preferred name, pronouns, gender identity, and sexual orientation. These additions work to ensure that the VA has updated information that accurately reflects how Veterans wish to be addressed.

OCTO Objectives
---------------

- Increase the quality and reliability of VA services
- Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
- Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features

Veteran Journey
---------------

Vision: 

Allow veterans to see and update their personal information so they have agency over how they're addressed by VA staff.

Mission: 

Add preferred name, pronouns, gender identity, and sexual orientation to help veterans accuately describe themselves within the VA.

Research Goals
--------------

-   Veterans understand the terminology used in the Personal Information section as it pertains to updating or changing their preferences.
-   Veterans can easily find the information needed to specify how they wish to be addressed when visiting VA facilities or communicating with a VA representative.
-   Veterans understand and are not misdirected by the order of the information fields presented.
-   Veterans can navigate through changing or updating their personal information to reflect their preferences
-   Veterans expect to find this information in this section of the profile and website

### Outcome

We will use these learnings from this research to determine if any content or IA changes are needed and refine our designs accordingly before they go into production.

### Research Questions

Content/IA:

-   Do the fields/information presented in the Personal Information section match Veterans' expectations?
-   Does the wording of options presented in the Personal Information section match Veterans' expectations?
-   Do Veterans understand the terminology used in the Personal Information section?
-   What terms do Veterans use to describe themselves pertaining to gender, sexual identity pronouns, and names? 
-   Do veterans feel they can find the information they need to accurately describe their personal information preferences?
-   How do Veterans expect to see this information organized on the page? Does anything about the placement of these fields cause confusion?
-   Do veterans find that there are any fields or options missing?

Relevance/Privacy/FAQ:

-   Do Veterans understand what this information is and why we are asking for it? (FAQ)

Adding or Changing Information:

-   Do Veterans understand how to edit and update their personal information?
-   Can Veterans navigate through the process of editing their personal information without encountering any usability hurdles?

### Hypothesis

-   Veterans will understand how to update their personal information preferences
-   Veterans will be pleased to have more control over how they are addressed when interacting with VA representatives 
-   Veterans will understand the overall fields and options but may have different expectations regarding specific terminology
-   Veterans will show confusion regarding specific terminology. We expect that some of the wording may be different than what they are used to.
-   Veterans will have questions about why we are asking for this information and where/how the information will be used.
-   Veterans will have questions as to whether or not this information is required.

### Method

We will be conducting remote, moderated usability testing sessions using Zoom. The sessions will be moderated using a high-fidelity prototype showing different edit states, in which the fields are prefilled and cannot be selected. We are most interested in feedback regarding content and IA; ability to move through and edit the forms on Profile has already been tested in previous research.
