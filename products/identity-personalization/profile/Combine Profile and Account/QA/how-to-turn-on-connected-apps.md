# How to turn on connected apps in staging

Notes from 7.24.20 meeting with Mark Greenburg:

1. Go here https://va-claims-staging.herokuapp.com/
2. Go to OAuth login and login with the staging user you want to set up connected apps for.
3. You will get a consent screen that asks you to Allow Access or Don't Allow. Select "Allow Access" in order to connect an app to VA.gov.

If it takes time to connect, there might be a caching issue. Try again, or talk to Mark if the issue persists.
