# How to turn on connected apps in staging

Notes from 7.24.20 meeting with Mark Greenburg:

1. Go here https://va-claims-staging.herokuapp.com/
2. Go to OAuth login and login with the staging user you want to set up connected apps for.
3. You will get a consent screen that asks you to accept or reject. Accept in order to connect an app to VA.gov.

May take over an hour to reconnect. Sounds like it shouldnâ€™t take that long but it might be wonky or caching issues.
