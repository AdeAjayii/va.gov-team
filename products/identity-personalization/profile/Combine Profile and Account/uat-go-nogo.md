# UAT Go/No-go | 8.24.20

- [ ] Any launch-blocker bugs or design issues still outstanding?
- [ ] Are all content updates outside of the profile complete?
- [ ] Is the code done and stable (save any known issues that we are not addressing before launch)?
- [ ] Are UAT recruiting requirements for test users clearly documented and outlined?
- [ ] Does anyone have any concerns that would stop us from conducting UAT starting one week from tomorrow?
