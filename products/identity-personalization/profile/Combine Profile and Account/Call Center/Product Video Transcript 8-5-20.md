## VA.gov Profile Product Video Transcript
 ##### created 8/4/2020

Hello everyone. I'm going to be discussing the new VA.gov user profile.


The new profile combines the existing VA.gov "Profile" page with the va.gov "Account” page. Going forward, this will be combined in one section under “Profile”. There have also been significant changes to the user interface within the user profile. Users can update or view the following information: personal contact information, military info, direct deposit, security settings and preferences, as well as their connected apps.
In order for a user to view the VA.gov user profile, they need to be logged into va.gov, found in the master person index (MPI), and have verified their identity on va.gov. There are two different types of profile users, users who HAVE verified their identity and users who HAVE NOT verified their identity. 


First, I'm going to show you what it looks like for a user who has not yet verified their identity.  Click the sign in button in the top. Right. Then enter your information. Then click the user's name on the top right. Scroll down and click profile. If you are a user who has not verified their identity, you'll be brought to the "Account security" screen where you can click the green button down here to verify your identity. If you have any questions on the identity verification process, you can click this drop down and it'll give you more information on what's required to verify your identity. You can also sign up for two factor authentication and change your sign-in email address. The other parts of the profile will not be available until after you have verified your identity.
Now I'm going to go ahead and show you what the profile looks like for a user who has verified their identity. As you can see, users who have verified that identity will be able to see all the different sections of the user profile. NOTE: The Direct Deposit feature will be missing from the side navigation menu if the user is not receiving compensation and pension benefits and/or has not turned on 2-factor authentication.


The **Personal and contact information** section gives an overview of the personal and contact information the VA has on file for them. The personal information section is non-editable, but there is a link right here that shows you how you can update this information if you are enrolled in the VA healthcare program and if you're not enrolled in the VA healthcare program.
Below that is the addresses section. You can click the link to the right to make edits to that information, then you can click update if you want to save changes or you can click cancel. Same thing with phone numbers. You also have the option to check this box if you want to have healthcare appointment text reminders. Below that, is a link that explains how your contact information is used in a little bit more detail. Below that you have the option to change your contact, email address, as well as changing the email address you use to sign in.


The **Military information** section shows the branch of military that a user served in as well as their period or periods of service. If that information looks incorrect, they can call the Defense Manpower Data Center and have that information corrected.


The **Direct deposit** section allows users to receive their compensation and pension benefits from the VA. Direct deposit for education benefits is only available on eBenefits. In order to view the direct deposit feature, a user must be logged in, receive compensation and pension benefits from the VA, have verified their identity, and have two factor authentication turned on. If they do not meet all of these criteria, the direct deposit feature will not show up in the side navigation menu on the left.
To edit their information, users can click the “edit” link to the right of their account information. Or, in the event that this is the first time they're setting up direct deposit, they click on a link that says "please add your bank account information". Once the user enters their information, they can click the update button to save the changes. 
To view payment history, you click the “view your payment history” link. This will take the user to the eBenefits website. To report fraud the user can call the number listed here.
To change direct deposit information for education benefits, the user will need to click this link and update the information on the eBenefits website. The user can also click this link to find out how to change their information by mail or phone. 


The **Account security** section allows the user to verify their identity, add two factor authentication, accept terms and conditions for medical conditions, and view or update their va.gov sign an email address. If the user has any questions about how to sign into va.gov, they can go to this FAQ link down here.


The **Connected apps** section allows users to connect third party, non-VA applications that can share certain information from the va.gov profile. For example, they can connect information from their VA health record to an app that helps them track their results. You can also see a list of different third party apps that you can add to your profile. If you have any questions about connected apps, you can click on this FAQ link at the bottom. This dropdown shows how a user can connect a third party app to the profile


In the event that they user already has applications connected to their profile, it will look more like this. The applications will be displayed at the top and they'll have the option to disconnect the app to the right or learn more about the app via the dropdown underneath the app's name. There are also a list of drop-downs here that show information related to the other apps that you can connect to your profile, how you can connect to third party apps in your profile, what you should do if your records are in a connected app, and what you should do if you no longer trust a connected app. Here is a view of the drop-downs that are expanded showing the information we just discussed.


If you have any questions or like detailed information related to the profile, you can find this information in the profile product guide. Thank you.
