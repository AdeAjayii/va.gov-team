# Profile 2.0 Release Plan 
---

## Phase I: moderated production testing (UAT)

### Planning:
- **Desired date range or test duration** Estimated: 8/26 - 9/8 
- **Desired number of users:** 10 users
- **How you'll recruit the right production test users:** We will recruit users via Perigean
- **How you'll conduct the testing:** We will share screen with users and ensure the different features work correctly
- **How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov:** We will have a feature flag turn it on for certain users based on their log-in email address.

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: Staged Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)

### The Plan
Launch behind a feature flag. Test with team. (1 day)
If things go well, we'll launch to 25% of traffic. (1 week)
If things go well, we'll launch to 50% of users. (48 hours)
If everything looks good, we'll then launch to 100% of users.
**Desired date range:** 9/9/20 - 9/23/20 
**How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can access it?** We will launch behind a feature flag and and control what % of users see Profile 2.0 using Flipper. 

**- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?:** 
We will monitor the following metrics to ensure there are no issues:

For each section:
Successful Retrievals
Failed Retrievals
Successful submissions
Failed form submissions
Error counts
Form Submits
Successful updates
Save failures

Profile visits

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
