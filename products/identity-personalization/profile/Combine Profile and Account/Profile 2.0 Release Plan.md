# Profile 2.0 Release Plan 
---

## Phase I: UAT

### Planning:
- **Desired date range or test duration** Estimated: 8/26 - 9/8 
- **Desired number of users:** 10 users
- **How you'll recruit the right production test users:** We will recruit users via Perigean
- **How you'll conduct the testing:** We will share screen with users and ensure the different features work correctly
- **How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov:** We will have a feature flag turn it on for certain users based on their log-in email address.

## Phase II: Staged Rollout

### The Plan

**Desired date range:** 9/9/20 - 9/23/20 

**How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can access it?** We will launch behind a feature flag and and control what % of users see Profile 2.0 using Flipper. 

- Launch behind a feature flag. Test with team. (1 day)
- If things go well, we'll launch to 25% of traffic. (1 week)
- If things go well, we'll launch to 50% of users. (48 hours)
- If everything looks good, we'll then launch to 100% of users.

**What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage?:** 
We will monitor the following metrics to ensure there are no issues:

Profile visits

For each section:
- Successful Retrievals
- Failed Retrievals
- Successful submissions
- Failed form submissions
- Error counts
- Form Submits
- Successful updates
- Save failures

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
