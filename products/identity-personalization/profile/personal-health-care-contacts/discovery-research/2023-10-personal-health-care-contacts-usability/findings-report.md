## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to assess users' understanding, reactions, and expectations to the proposed Emergency contact and Next of kin feature within the VA.gov profile.

Evaluate how easily users are able to find this information.
Evaluate if the proposed designs are understandable and useful across participant types (sighted and low/no vision) and screen sizes (mobile and desktop).

## Research Questions
1. Are users able to navigate to the Emergency contact and Next of kin information from an unauthenticated state?
 
	- Is it intuitive to find this information within VA.gov profile?

2. What are users' reactions to and understanding of the proposed designs? 

	- Is it clear that the “Personal health care contacts” only pertain to health care? 
	- Is it clear to users how to update their information? 
	- Do participants understand what is meant by “Next of kin” information? 

3. What is the user mental model around Emergency contact and Next of kin information? 
	- How do veterans define emergency contact and next of kin?
	- How is the “read only” data useful to Veterans?
	- How many Emergency contacts and Next of kin contacts do people want/expect to list/see?'
	- When or where do people expect to be asked about this information? 	
	- What type of information for both Emergency contact and Next of kin do users expect to need to provide?


## Methodology 
We conducted remote usability and interview sessions with Zoom. The interviews consisted of a combination of tasks and direct questions. We conducted the study in the staging environment, with a test user created specifically for the purpose of this study.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
_Hypothesis 1:_ Participants will sign in, go to the "Profile", then navigate to “Personal health care contacts” in order to view EC and NOK information.  

_Hypthesis 2:_ Participants will understand the EC and NOK information and understand how to update information. 

_Hypthesis 3:_ Participants will want to be able to edit or add EC and NOK information in place.

## Details of Findings 

### 1) Participants expected that they would need to sign in to VA.gov and most participants (6 of 9) looked for information about "Medical emergency contact" and "Next of kin contact" within their profile. 

When asked how a participant would ensure the VA has the correct information on file, all 9 participants were able to recognize and articulate how they would start that process by signing in. 

After signing in/or articulating that process: 

- 4 participants navigated directly to the Profile hub (sign in > Profile > Profile Hub) 
- 1 participant attempted to navigate to the My HealtheVet profile as they related this information to health (sign in > My HealtheVet) but At "second guess", this participant headed to the VA.gov profile
- 1 participant "keyword forged" the landing page and used the mega menu to navigate to the healthcare hub section. After, not finding what they were looking for, they went to profile.
---
- 2 participants attempted to search "Emergency contact" or "next of kin" and were unable to find information and navigate to profile
- 1 participant was confused by the staging user name in the authenticated menu and could not locate information in profile

> The first thing I think is to go to profile and then I'd look for stuff here. "Personal health care contacts," I would think. And bada bing, there it is." - P7

### 3) The majority of participants understood the "Profile hub" page and used the "Personal health care contacts" section to navigate/view emergency contact and next of kin information. 

- 6 participants navigated with ease (some relying on hint text)
- 1 participant went "Contact information" first before navigating to "Personal health care contacts" page

*Note* 2 participants were having technical challenges during this portion of the study

---

### 4) Participants expected or wanted a way to edit or add both Medical emergency contact and Next of kin contact information on the Personal health care contacts page.
All 9 participants expected or wanted this functionality

P1: “well, I would expect information or instructions about how to be able to do it myself. IT's fine with me like this but it would be nice if I could do it myself on this website.”

P3: "You should be able to click on it to make a change and it should give you the option."

P6: "Man that’s horrible! You should be able to do it on the website." 

---

### 5) Most participants wanted at least two Medical emergency contacts. 

- 9 of 9 participants wanted multiple contacts listed in case the primary contact was not available.

---

### 6) Most participants wanted at least two Next of kin listed. 

- 7 of the 9 participants wanted multiple next of kin contacts listed.
- 2 participants felt that one Next of kin would be sufficient.

### 7) Some (have to get numbers) participants wanted functionally to prioritize multiple Medical emergency contacts and Next of kin contacts.

### 8) (Most) Participants wanted "relationship" listed as well as "Home and Mobile" phone numbers.

- Participants specifically talked about the importance of adding these data points so the VA would have more context when reaching out to the person.
- One participant brought up the importance of labeling a home phone so that no one would accidentally try to send a text message to that number.
- 2 participants expected all the information that the VA has on file about emergency contacts and next of kin to be displayed on the Personal health care contacts page

P7: “Whatever information that I gave them that I thought as enough to be able to get ahold of them.” 

P8: “you're going to have to provide a wealth of information to get in touch with them”


### 9) It was clear to participants that both Medical Emergency contact and Next of kin contact are related only to health care.

### 10) Medical" in Medical emergency contact caused some confusion with participants. However, all participants understood the term Emergency contact.

- At least two participants thought Medical emergency contact was a contact they could reach out to if they had an emergency and needed assistance right away, similar to 911.
