## Research Goals

The purpose of this research is to assess users' understanding, reactions, and expectations to the proposed Emergency contact and Next of kin feature within the VA.gov profile.

Evaluate how easily users are able to find this information.
Evaluate if the proposed designs are understandable and useful across participant types (sighted and low/no vision) and screen sizes (mobile and desktop).

## Research Questions
1. Are users able to navigate to the Emergency contact and Next of kin information from an unauthenticated state?
 
	- Is it intuitive to find this information within VA.gov profile?

2. What are users' reactions to and understanding of the proposed designs? 

	- Is it clear that the “Personal health care contacts” only pertain to health care? 
	- Is it clear to users how to update their information? 
	- Do participants understand what is meant by “Next of kin” information? 

3. What is the user mental model around Emergency contact and Next of kin information? 
	- How do veterans define emergency contact and next of kin?
	- How is the “read only” data useful to Veterans?
	- How many Emergency contacts and Next of kin contacts do people want/expect to list/see?'
	- When or where do people expect to be asked about this information? 	
	- What type of information for both Emergency contact and Next of kin do users expect to need to provide?


## Methodology 
We conducted remote usability and interview sessions with Zoom. The interviews consisted of a combination of tasks and direct questions. We conducted the study in the staging environment, with a test user created specifically for the purpose of this study.

## Hypotheses and Conclusions
_Hypothesis 1:_ Participants will sign in, go to the "Profile", then navigate to “Personal health care contacts” in order to view EC and NOK information.  

_Hypthesis 2:_ Participants will understand the EC and NOK information and understand how to update information. 

_Hypthesis 3:_ Participants will want to be able to edit or add EC and NOK information in place. 

## Key Findings

## Details of Findings 
### 1) Starting from the unauthenticated state of VA.gov landing page, all 9 participants expected that they would need to sign in to view their "Medical emergency contact" and "Next of kin" information on file. 

9 of 9 participants were able to recognize and articulate how they would start that process.

---

### 2) Most participants (6 of 9) sought information about "Medical emergency contact" and "Next of kin contact" within their VA.gov profile. 

- 4 participants navigated directly to profile on VA.gov
- 2 participants attempted to navigate to the My HealtheVet profile (as they related it to health) but at "second guess" went to the VA.gov profile 
- 2 participants attempted to search "Emergency contact" or "next of kin" and were unable to find information
- 1 participant was confused by staging user name in the authenticated menu and could not locate information in profile 

---

### 3) The majority of participants understood the "Profile hub" page and used the "Personal health care contacts" section to navigate/view emergency contact and next of kin information. 

- 6 participants navigated with ease (some relying on hint text)
- 1 participant went "Contact information" first before navigating to "Personal health care contacts" page

*Note* 2 participants were having technical challenges during this portion of the study
