# Address Change Messaging Discovery

DRAFT

## Background

Based on design feedback from office hours, solutions for Content/IA changes address change modals were updated to meet suggestions that will allow us to move forward with modal solution. Their suggestions included changes to modal content/IA, as well as other questions to address surrounding the entire address update flow. In addition, a one-per-page solution was suggestion, which we will not be exploring for Profile at this time.

Our team then held a workshop/brainstorming session to discuss the following:
-   proposed modal mockups with updates to content/IA (see #35582)
-   our additional questions surrounding the entire address update process on the Contact information page: user flow, multiple alerts, edge cases -- see #35985.

Based on this group discussion, the modal content/IA was then updated and reviewed by Danielle (see #35987). The resulting modal solution (Sketch file) clears the concerns proposed at office hours and follows all design system guidance.

This discovery is a follow-up task addressing point 2 above -- to answer questions our team had that were separate from the modal content/IA. This includes questions regarding the "Use mailing address for home address" checkbox, how to handle multiple in line alerts, and other possible changes discussed during the session.

## Activities

-   Review the product outline

-   Meeting with Samara and Marci for an intro to the work.

-   Researched answers to questions discussed in team workshop. 

## Questions:

-   How many in-line alerts?

-   Should we replicate checkbox and modal in reverse as well?
-   How to help avoid confusion between the two addresses?
-   Confirm what happens to the checkboxes in different scenarios.
-   Where would in-line alerts appears depending on errors for one or both of the addresses?
-   How to handle scenarios where address entered is not in the USPS database?Â I believe this pertains to what Liz had already mocked up for the new versions of the alerts (prompts to look at and re-edit address)
-   Could we (long term) remove the USPS address validation step if we did validation on the fly while someone inputs an address into the form fields?
-   Questions surrounding military address checkbox behavior.
