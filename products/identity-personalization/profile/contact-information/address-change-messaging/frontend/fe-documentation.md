# Address Change Messaging Front-End Documentation

**Last updated May 24, 2022**

If a user updates their Home address and it does not their Mailing address, they will be prompted to review and update their Mailing address. Mailing address must be kept updated as it may be where Veterans receive VA bills, notices, and prescriptions.  

For more on this, please read the [initial brief](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/contact-information/address-change-messaging/initiative-brief.md).
