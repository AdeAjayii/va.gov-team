# Bad Address Indicator Front-End Documentation

## Email

This initial email template will be sent out through VA Notify to alert Veterans that their email address has been flagged as invalid and needs reviewing.

- **Initial email blast** - Initially, the email will be sent out at once to all Veterans with addresses that are currently flagged as invalid. 
- **Event triggered emails** - Following the initial email blast, the email will be sent out to Veterans with newly flagged addresses - on a daily or weekly basis. Sent out when new addresses are flagged as bad addresses - whenever a new bad address is added.
