# Contact information: address validation triggered
**Last updated: July 11, 2022**
If a user changes their address from the VA.gov profile and that address triggers the address validation, they will be presented with the address validation flow.
There are 8 possibles flows a user can go through.

## UX

### Validation is overrideable and there are suggestions

- "Continue" will take users to the confirmation screen; "Cancel" or "X" will close the form.
- "Edit address" will take them back to the Edit form.

## Confirmation screens

After someone sees one of the states of the validation screen above, there are two potential next steps:

1. They edit their address. This will take them back to the edit form.
2. They will either override the determination that their address was a problem, OR they will select a suggested address. Either way, they should move on to a **confirmation screen**. The are **two** states of the confirmation screen:

### Confirmation screen for flows with suggested addresses

- "Update" will close the form and save the new address; "Cancel" or "X" will close the form.
- "View suggested addresses" will take users back to the address validation screen.

**Copy**

### Confirmation screens for flows without suggested addresses

From this screen, "Update" will close the form and save the new address; "Cancel" or "X" will close the form.
