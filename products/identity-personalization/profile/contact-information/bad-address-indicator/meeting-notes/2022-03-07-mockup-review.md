# Bad Address Indicator Mockup Review

## Attendees
- Christina Gednalske (host)
- Samara Strauss
- Marci McGuire
- Adam Whitlock
- Tom Harrison

## Notes
- Alert for updating contact info probably not needed
- Placement of the update message above the H1 will probably be an accessibility concern
- In this case, we don't have to have a dismissible option because it will be connected directly with VA Profile, so we'll know whether to show the bad address alert or not.

## Discussion
- Do we want the bad address on all of the Profile pages or JUST on Personal Info page.
- Would this only be done on Staging (Contact vs. Personal information)
- What is the timeline with the delay on Personal Info? 
  - Unless something goes really sideways, personal info can probably go out first.
  - We can just hold on launch until after that goes in.
  - Design intent - we have to explain the email part of things.  They are going to ask how people are going to know about that.  The initial email blast and if someone has a new indicator.
- In the event someone's address got mistakenly flagged, we should probably allow them to verify that their address is correct.  We need to check with VA Profile about that.  We do allow overrides for other things (like address validation).
- Tom can check with Barry about how we can allow them to save the flagged address without changing anything.
- It probably won't be the same flow as what we have for the USPS address validation override.
- Ideally the copy won't be that long, but it's placeholder text.  The email can have more context.  We don't have to have a much copy in the UI.
- Adam suggested that there's an alert we might be able to use that shows up when someone doesn't have a phone number.  

## Action Items
- Tom will reach out to Barry about the technical feasibility of clearing the flag without changing the address
- Adam will look for the alert he referenced and share it with Christina
- Christina will shorten the copy in the mockups
- Christina will tweak the design based on what Tom finds out
- Marci will request a design intent  after mockup is finalized & make sure to mention how the email blast and event-driven emails will drive users to this page.
