This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**

- To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
- To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
- To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

**#1: 7/10 participants quickly noticed and understood the Personal information page alert.**

  > “Quote” from P3 - Process of updating the address was very straightforward
  

**#2: 6/10 participants did NOT notice the Contact information page main alert or found the contents unclear.**

- Some participants do not seem to notice or read the second alert, with a few stating the second alert was the same as the first one. However, some of the participants who did not read the second alert still completed the tasks quickly. Participants who read the alert often did not fully read the contents, reading only the first part and then jumping to the last part ("..select Update to confirm.").

 > Quote from participant who sees this everywhere on MyHealtheVet

- 4/10 participants found the wording unclear in the Contact information page main alert and did not understand what “Update” meant in the context of confirming an address. Many conveyed they felt there should be something that directly said “confirm.”
  
 > “Quote” (P1, P2, P4, P6)


**#3: Participants varied on how urgent they considered the alerts. 5/9 considered them very urgent, while 2/9 considered them somewhat urgent. 1 participant considered the alerts optional and not very urgent.** 

(_NOTE: this question was missed for P5_)
  
 > “It’s pretty important, especially as far as I know there shouldn’t be an issue with my address. So I would check it right away.” - P7
  
 > “Considering I get prescriptions and appointment cards in the mail it is important to me that the contact information for mailing is correct.” - P8
  

**#4: Veterans understood how to correct an error in their mailing address.**

- All participants quickly identified how to correct their information. Some did this without looking at the instructions.
  
 > “Quote”
  

**#5: 7/10 Veterans had trouble understanding how to confirm their already-correct address.** 

- 5/10 Veterans said they would ignore the alerts and not do anything if they couldn’t figure out how to confirm that their address was correct.

 > "There's no click here to verify or confirm." "This tells me to do something with no way to do it." - P9 

- 1 participant thought no action was needed if their mailing address was already correct.

- A few participants were able to figure out the instructions for confirming, but only after further prompting. 
 
 > "I guess I hit update even though I'm not updating anything. That's odd. Seems more like a confirmation than an update." - P6
  

**#6: Participants had a positive response to the new observer method used for the study.**

- All participants felt comfortable with observers and appreciated being asked for consent for additional observers. 
- All but 3 participants said they felt more at ease after observers said hello. 
	- One of these participants conveyed he did not know observers had joined and were waving because he couldn’t see them on mobile. Multiple participants on mobile said they could not see other observers, and therefore if observers did not say an audible hello, did not know they were there. 
		- **Takeaway:** for this method, it's important that observers say audible hellos in case participants cannot see observers. 
	- For one of these participants, this may have to do with only two observers on the call, one of whom did not say hello. 
		- **Takeaway:** All observers that join should do their best to participate in this method by saying hello.

 > “I wasn’t on the page that even showed them. I had me full screen and I had you as a thumbnail. That may have been on a secondary page in Zoom to see like a group meeting sort of thing, but I only saw you and me only because I was in that mode.” - P6

> “It was kind of awkward.” - P13
