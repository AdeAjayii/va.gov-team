Research Goals and Questions
============================

### 1\. Validate that our proposed alert method successfully prompts Veterans to update their mailing address
-   Do users notice the alerts?
-   How urgent do Veterans consider the alerts?
-   Are users inclined to ignore or follow the alerts? 

### 2\. Validate that our alerts are easy to understand
-   Can users understand the instructions included in the alerts?
-   Do users understand how to update their address vs. confirm their address?

### 3\. Validate that Veterans can easily update or confirm their Mailing address by following these alerts
-   Can users easily navigate to the Contact information page from the Personal information page using the alert link?
-   Can users easily navigate to the Mailing address from the top of the Contact information page using the jump link?
-   Can users easily locate the smaller alert within the Mailing address field?

### Outcome

We'll use the findings from this research to update our alert content and inform our MVP designs.

Methodology
===========

We conducted remote usability testing over Zoom using a prototype on production. This allowed us to use a code-based prototype and be more inclusive with our recruitment approach. 

Hypothesis and Conclusions
==========================

-   Veterans will easily locate the main alerts
  -   LIKELY TRUE
-   Veterans will use the alert links to reach the Mailing address field without difficulty
  -   DEFINITELY TRUE
-   Veterans may have difficulty understanding the alert instructions
  -   LIKELY TRUE
-   Veterans may have difficulty understanding how to update their address vs. how to confirm their address
  -   LIKELY TRUE
-   We believe the design for the alerts will be effective at drawing attention to important information
  -   DEFINITELY TRUE

Key Findings
============
1.  7/10 participants quickly noticed and understood the Personal information page alert.
2.  6/10 participants did NOT notice the Contact information page main alert or found the contents unclear.
3.  The majority of participants considered the alerts urgent.
4.  Participants understood how to correct an error in their mailing address.
5.  Most participants (7/10) had trouble understanding how to confirm an already-correct address.
6.  A few participants expressed being concerned that by confirming their address via Update, there may inadvertently be a change made somewhere in the background to their already correct address.
7.  Participants had a positive response to the new observer method used for the study.
8.  Some participants had suggestions for miscellaneous changes on the Contact information page.

Details of Findings
===================

Initial Findings
----------------

### #1: 7/10 participants quickly noticed and understood the Personal information page alert.

 > "That is new. I did notice that and haven't seen it before." - P3

 > "It is confusing because my mailing address should be correct, but I do like that it popped up right away" - P8

### #2: 6/10 participants did NOT notice the Contact information page main alert or found the contents unclear.

Some participants do not seem to notice or read the second alert, with a few stating the second alert was the same as the first one. Participants who read the alert often did not fully read the contents, reading only the first part and then jumping to the last part ("..select Update to confirm."). Participants paid more attention to the smaller yellow alert on the Contact information page.

 > "With all of the other pages with banners like this for Covid and flood warnings never apply to me so I just don't look at these." - P9, referring to the gray alert with a yellow stripe used on MyHealtheVet pages as well as elsewhere on va.gov

 > "That big "review your address" is standing out." - P7, referring to the smaller all-yellow alert

4/10 participants found the wording unclear in the Contact information page main alert and did not understand what "Update" meant in the context of confirming an address. Many conveyed they felt there should be something that directly said "confirm."

 > "And then here it says "...if it's correct, select 'Update'." It shouldn't be Update. I'm not updating anything, I'm just confirming it's correct. Updating is changing." - P1

 > "Well it shouldn't be Update, it should be a different button with "confirm it's correct." And even here if I want to Update, there's no Update, there's nowhere I can click Update if I had to put Update. They wrote it here, but there's no Update below that." - P1

 > "And it says after you do anything - if it's already correct or if you've done anything, select Update. And I don't see an Update button." - P2

 > "Why isn't there a button saying, 'This address is fine?'." - P5

 > "There's no confirm button, and edit tells me to change it." - P9

### #3: The majority of participants considered the alerts urgent.

5/9 considered the alerts urgent, while 2/9 considered them somewhat urgent. 1 participant considered the alerts optional and not very urgent.

Note: this question was missed for P5

 > "It's pretty important, especially as far as I know there shouldn't be an issue with my address. So I would check it right away." - P7

 > "Considering I get prescriptions and appointment cards in the mail it is important to me that the contact information for mailing is correct." - P8

 > "It's not really important. Important would be something bigger and red, not yellow." - P1

### #4: Participants understood how to correct an error in their mailing address.

All participants quickly identified how to correct their information. Some did this without looking at the instructions.

 > "Very straightforward." - P3

 > "Self-explanatory." - P2

 > "If my info wasn't correct, I would click 'Edit' and click 'Update'. If my zip code wasn't correct, I would put in the new zip code and click 'Update'. I would hope the alerts would go away." - P5

 > "It was very streamline. I still like working from my laptop for things like this. So, especially with it being mobile, I'd say it's very user friendly and everything reads very well as well." - P8

### #5: Most participants (7/10) had trouble understanding how to confirm an already-correct address.

5/10 Veterans said they would ignore the alerts and not do anything if they couldn't figure out how to confirm that their address was correct.

 > "I wouldn't do anything I would skip it. I would assume people don't know what they are doing. It tells me to review but not telling me how to." "Then I would scroll on down to make sure it is good. I wouldn't do anything because there's no way to confirm it." - P9

 > "There isn't anything for me to do. There isn't anywhere I can 'Confirm'. I wouldn't click on 'Edit' because I don't have anything to edit." - P1

 > "But then I would go here and I would do nothing, because I reviewed it, but there's no option to confirm it's correct." - P1

 > "Since it's correct, I won't do anything." - P1

2 participants thought looking at the address or hitting cancel (no updates) if their mailing address was already correct would fulfill the request.

 > "I would guess it's saying 'Review your address' alert will show up only one time I'm visiting this page." "I would log out and go back in to confirm the alert went away." - P5

 > "Hitting cancel is fulfilling my obligation to the page." -P4

A few of these participants were able to figure out how to confirm, but only after further prompting.

 > "I guess I hit update even though I'm not updating anything. That's odd. Seems more like a confirmation than an update." - P6

### #6: A few participants expressed privacy concerns around the current process to confirm their address by Updating without making any changes.

A few participants were concerned that by confirming their address via Update, a change may have inadvertently been made to their already correct address somewhere in the background.

 > "Sometimes when I see update when I'm only confirming things then I kind of get a little, not paranoid, but I do security, IT security, myself and I would just think that's odd. Did somebody make a change I didn't know about?" - P6

 > P9

### #7: Participants had a positive response to the new observer method used for the study.

All participants felt comfortable with observers and appreciated being asked for consent for additional observers.

 > "I appreciated it, I wouldn't have cared but it was nice." - P7

 > "The refresher of asking definitely was considerate because I could have changed my mind, so that was definitely appreciated." - P3

All but 3 participants said they felt more at ease after observers said hello.

-   One of these participants conveyed he did not know observers had joined and were waving because he couldn't see them on mobile. Multiple participants on mobile said they could not see other observers, and therefore if observers did not say an audible hello, did not know they were there.
  - Takeaway: for this method, it's important that observers say audible hellos in case participants cannot see observers.

-   For one of these participants, this may have to do with only two observers on the call, one of whom did not say hello.
  - Takeaway: All observers that join should do their best to participate in this method by saying hello.

 > "More at ease since I could see it was one person and not a whole boardroom." - P9

 > "I wasn't on the page that even showed them. I had me full screen and I had you as a thumbnail. That may have been on a secondary page in Zoom to see like a group meeting sort of thing, but I only saw you and me only because I was in that mode." - P6

 > "Um, I wasn't on the page that even showed that. I had me fullscreen and I had you as a thumbnail. But I didn't see..that might have been on a secondary screen in Zoom to see like a group meeting sort of a thing, but I only saw me and you only because I was in that mode, apparently." (direct quote) - P6

 > "It was kind of awkward." - P13

### #8: Some participants had suggestions for miscellaneous changes on the Contact information page.

Following the tasks, a few participants mentioned miscellaneous items for which they had suggestions or questions, such as inconsistent capitalization in "Review your Address," as well confusion around the email address appearing in all caps.  

(P8 or 9?)

## Additional Findings

### #1: Multiple participants (2+) described or showed difficulty with logging in (most often through MyHealtheVet). 

We observed difficulties logging in through MyHealtheVet and heard from Veterans that this had been going on for a while with this particular login method. Our 11th participant, a screen reader user, spent the majority of the session trying to log in with assistance from our screen reader tech specialist and was not able to make it to the tasks due to this extensive delay.

 > "In the past month there have been issues with it not registering my login, but I guess that's due to the changes they've been making. I thought oh it's just my system, but then it happens on other people's laptops and phones, not just mine. And the answer was to erase all cookies. And that would do it as long as it was cleared of cookies. If there was a cookie in there from a prior visit, it would act like it was logging in, but it never truly logged in, but that is just with the MyHealtheVet one." - P6

 > Quote from P4, similar issues with MyHealtheVet

### #2: Some participants expressed frustration with changes to contact information not being updated everywhere, or not being sure where it had been updated.

Participants expressed frustration around not knowing where they still needed to make changes after updating contact information. They noted a lack of direct information and transparency around where exactly their information would be updated, and often referenced the "Change your address in your VA.gov profile" info page. P1 also expressed frustration with the disconnect between that when he updates info on the va website that the medical centers don't get that info and he has to update them each

 > "I'm going to call the main VA and find out...when I download the PDF that shows all your health information it still has, there's so many different, it just seems like it lists like so many addresses" - P6

 > "Will update your information across several VA benefits and services" but it's not all of them. Maybe a couple, I don't know which ones exactly." - P1, while looking at the "Change your address in your VA.gov profile" info page.

 > "Ya, like as soon as I moved here I changed my address and everything on this, on the computer, and every time you go to any kind of clinic, let's say I go to the eye doctor, I need to give them the address; they had the old one. You go see your primary care, you need to tell them. You go see the foot doctor, you know... none have the updated information. Unless you give it to them in person at each clinic, they don't communicate. It looks like each building has its own database and they don't communicate with any other clinic, any other building, anything else." - P1

### #3: One of our participants, a screen reader user who did not make it to the tasks, had significant difficulty attempting to navigate the home page to access his Profile.

Even with guidance from an accessibility specialist/screen reader expert, one of our participants had an extremely difficult time navigating the homepage. If extensive research has not already been done with both beginner and advanced screen reader users, the identity team may want to consider exploring the current difficulty level of the login process for these Veterans.

### #8: A few participants reached Profile or contact information directly through the "Change your address in your VA.gov profile" page

This page proved to be one that was referenced or used often to reach Profile or edit contact information. This may be something to keep in mind when considering the mental model users have when looking to accessing Profile or editing one's contact information.

Recommendations
===============

The following recommendations center mostly around reorganizing and revisiting the content, to keep the current overall flow and maintain the successful Correct/Update pathway.

1.  Consider revisiting the content included within the Contact information alerts to further simplify the text and avoid confusion surrounding the two pathways of Updating and Confirming an address
  - Determine if it is best to further differentiate between the Personal info and Contact info main alerts OR if these alerts should be made exactly the same (with some participants assuming they were the same and not reading the second alert)
  - Consider separating out the instructions related to Confirming from the primary instructions for Updating an address
  - Consider relocating the Confirm instructions within an additional information dropdown component (link) "What to do if your address is already correct" - to be accessed only when needed and help remove confusion surrounding Update Address and Confirm Address. Also consider expandable alert (link).
  - Consider including the instructions for Confirming in the smaller alert in the mailing address field, closer to where participants are usually seeking this information during the Confirm task
  - List Confirm instructions in an easy-to-read format, such as bullet points, to more clearly convey this information

3.  Consider editing "Review your Address" to "Review your address"

4.  Consider changing the email format to all lowercase

Related recommendations: Change content/structure of alert. Most confusion comes from how to confirm address, yet this is the secondary action, so can we put an FAQ in the alert(s) to give these instructions, only when needed, extra simplifying them?

Simplify larger alert as it is often overlooked - keep for vital screen reader focus path. Move Confirm information into smaller alert (when and where this information is usually needed and looked for) in a FAQ additional info dropdown so users will not need to sift through this information unless it pertains to them.
