### About these ratings 

Ratings are provided by Veterans who've attended this school. We reach out to Veterans who receive a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) for benefits, when they transfer into or out of a school, or when they graduate. to provide a rating. If schools request to know which Veterans provided ratings,  we'll provide a list of all individuals who've provided ratings, but not the individual ratings they've provided.  The ratings Veterans provide won't be individually to the individual.
