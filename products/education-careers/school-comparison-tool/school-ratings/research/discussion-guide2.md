# School Ratings Discussion Guide


*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we would be looking at the Comparison Tool and talking about ratings and what information is helpful for Veterans when determining if a particular school is a good fit for them.  
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Let’s start with a few warm-up questions.
  - Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before? 
    - If yes, what did you use it for?
 
 - Are you currently using or have you ever used your education benefits?
   - If yes, which benefit are you using?  
       - When did you start school?  Where did you go?
 
   - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future?  
       - Which benefit?  
       - Where are you in the school selection process?
   
 - When you were trying to pick a school, can you talk me through your decision-making process?
  - What were/are you looking for in a school?  How would you determine if it was a good fit for you?
  - If you knew a fellow Veteran who had attended a school you're interested in, what would you want to know the most?
  
## First Task: Initial Look at Ratings - 20 minutes

Let's say you really like the programs at **Insert school**, but you aren't sure what your experience would be like as a Veteran student. How would you use the Comparison Tool to determine what other Veterans thought of **Insert school**?  

**When user sees rating** 
 - What do you think of that rating? (top, overall one)
 - What do you think that rating shows you?
 - Who do you think provided that rating?
 - How do you think that rating was collected?
 
_Potential Prompt if they don't click school_ Would you have enough information to make a decision?  Or would you need more information on ratings?

- What do you think the different categories mean?
- Would any of these categories be valuable to you? If yes, which ones?
  - Why are these categories important to you?  Why are they not important?
- Are there any other categories you would like or expect to see?
- What do you think of the school now that you've seen the rating?
- Do you think the ratings are trustworthy?

Things to watch for:
- How does the user select the school (School name or View Details)?
-	Where does the user initially look for Veteran-specific information?
- Does the user notice the ratings on the school cards?
- Does the user click into the school for additional information on ratings without a prompt?

Upon completion of task: (Do we need this?)
- How did you think that went? 
- On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very hard and 5 is very easy, how would you rate this task?


 ## Second Task - Comparing Various Rating Aspects - 10 minutes
 
Let's say you were trying to decide which campus to attend at **University of California**.  You plan to live on campus and all the campuses offer the classes you want to take.  Using the Comparison Too, how would you decide which campus to attend?
 
 Things to watch for:
-  Does the user look at the overall rating or delve into the detailed ratings?
-  Does the user pause or read the caution flag?

Upon completion of task: (Do we need this?)
- How did you think that went? 
- On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very hard and 5 is very easy, how would you rate this task?
- What aspects of the ratings are you looking at (star rating, number of reviews, etc.)?
- Are there any other aspects of these schools that weigh into your decision (e.g. caution flag)?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
-	Do you have general thoughts or feedback on the Comparison Tool that you’d like to share? 
-	Any questions for me?
- I want to give a chanced to the other people on the line to ask a question.

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, thanks so much and enjoy the rest of your day!
