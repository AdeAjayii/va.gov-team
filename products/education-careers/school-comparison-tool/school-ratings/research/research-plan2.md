# Research Plan for School Ratings
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	 	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
- Booz Allen research for Education Services / OIT
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

When Veterans are looking for schools within the Comparison tool, they want to know about the experiences of other Veterans to form a better understanding of what their personal experience at the school would be like. Ratings enable Veterans to quickly assess the suitability of a school (both pro and con), bolstering their confidence and level of comfort in deciding if a particular school is right for them.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

- What do users think of the star ratings?
- Who do users think are providing the ratings?
- How does the number of ratings weigh into a user's perception of a particular school?
- Are users interested in the different rating categories or just the overall score?
- Which categories are valuable to users?  Are there any categories that aren't valuable?  Are there any additional categories they would like to see?
- What do users think the different categories mean?
- How do users think the rating scores are determined (average of submitted scores, calculated value, etc.)?
- Would ratings affect the school selection process?
- Do users think the ratings are useful?
- How do users think ratings are collected?
- How trustworthy are the ratings?
- What level of privacy do users expect if they would provide a rating?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 

We believe that Veterans will understand the rating categories and find the ratings useful, especially in determining the Veteran experience at a particular school.

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

Researchers need to be able to see how users react and interact with school ratings.  We need to be able to ask about their impressions and expectations of those ratings to determine if the current design is meeting their needs.  We also need to identify any points of confusion and whether this feature will be valuable to Veterans.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 

 - Online using Zoom
 
4.	What will you be testing? 
 - Prototype and content
 
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
 - Zoom
 
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)
