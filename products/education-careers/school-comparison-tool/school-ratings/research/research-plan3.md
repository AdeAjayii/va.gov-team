# Research Plan for School Ratings
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	 	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
- Booz Allen research for Education Services / OIT
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

When Veterans are looking for schools within the Comparison tool, they want to know about the experiences of other Veterans to form a better understanding of what their personal experience at the school would be like. Ratings enable Veterans to quickly assess the suitability of a school (both pro and con), bolstering their confidence and level of comfort in deciding if a particular school is right for them.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	



4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 

We believe that Veterans will understand the rating categories and find the ratings useful, especially in determining the Veteran experience at a particular school.

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

Researchers need to be able to see how users react and interact with school ratings.  We need to be able to ask about their impressions and expectations of those ratings to determine if the current design is meeting their needs.  We also need to identify any points of confusion and whether this feature will be valuable to Veterans.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 

 - Online using Zoom
 
4.	What will you be testing? 
 - Page and content
 
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
 - Zoom
 
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	


2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
- Recruitment will be performed by Perigean Technologies	

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.)  
*      
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 
* By COB: 
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 
  - 
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? 
 
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 
*
