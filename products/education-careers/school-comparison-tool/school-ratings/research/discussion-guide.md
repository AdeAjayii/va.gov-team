# School Ratings Discussion Guide


*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we would like to talk about ratings and what information is helpful to Veterans when determining if a particular school would be a good fit for them.  Specifically, if the VA asked Veterans who had attended a particular school to give feedback on a school, what value would that offer Veterans and what information would they want to know?
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 50 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.
 - Are you currently using or have you ever used your education benefits?
   - If yes, which benefit are you using?  When did you start school?
   - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future?  Which benefit?
   
 - Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before? 
  - If yes, what did you use it for?

## Ratings Experience and Overall Value - 15 min

I'm curious about how you use ratings when you're looking at a particular product or service.  For example, if you're purchasing a new vacuum cleaner or trying a new restaurant, how do you decide if you want to try that product or service?  If a product or service has ratings, do those ratings influence your decision?

  - When you're looking at ratings, what aspects do you pay close attention to (e.g. number of stars, number of people who rated it)?  
  - Are there any aspects that aren't important to you?  
  - Why are these aspects important or not important to you?
  - What helps you decide if a rating or review is trustworthy?
  - Do ratings influence your ultimate decision?  If so, how much?
  
- Are there any particular sites that you frequently visit that use ratings?  What do you like about these sites?
- Have you ever looked at sites to compare schools?  
   - If yes, which ones?  What did you like about those sites?

## Categories - 15 minutes
The VA would like to give prospective students better visibility into the educational experience other Veterans have had at a particular school.  Some sites like Amazon allow users to rate a product or service on a variety of factors such as product quality, timeliness of delivery, etc.  

- If prior student Veterans provided ratings for schools (particularly one you were interested in attending), what factors would be most valuable to you?

- Is there any other information that you would like to know from Veterans who had attended a school you were interested in?

- (As applicable) In terms of school ratings, there are a few factors I would like to get your feedback on.  What do you think the factor means and would it be helpful in your decision making process?
Star Ratings:
  - Institution Overall
  - Quality of Classes
  - Veteran Friendliness
  - Employment Preparation
  - Recruiting/Marketing Practices
Yes / No:
 - Would you recommend this school to another Veteran?
 - If you had to use your education benefits again, would you still attend this institution?

- Who do you think should be able to submit ratings for a school?
   - Someone who applied and was accepted 
   - Someone who applied and was rejected
   - Someone who attended classes, but didn't complete their degree
   - Someone who finished their degree
   
 - Since VA hosts the site where these ratings would live, would that impact whether you felt the ratings were trustworthy or not?  


## Ratings Location - 10 minutes

This is a school profile page on the Comparison Tool.  If school ratings were incorporated into this page, where would you expect the ratings to be?

 - Would adding ratings make this page more valuable or just more cluttered?
 - If school ratings were added, what do you think would happen to the student complaints section? 


## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
