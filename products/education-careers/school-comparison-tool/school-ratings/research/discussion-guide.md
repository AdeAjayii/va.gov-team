# School Ratings Discussion Guide


*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we would like to talk about ratings and what information is helpful to Veterans when determining if a particular school would be a good fit for them.  Specifically, if the VA asked Veterans who had attended a particular school to give feedback on a school, what value would that offer Veterans and what information would they want to know?
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 50 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.
 - Are you currently using or have you ever used your education benefits?
   - If yes, when did you start school?
   - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future?
 - Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before? 
  - If yes, what did you use it for?

## Ratings Experience and Overall Value - 15 min

I'm curious about how you use ratings in your daily life.  When you're interested in buying a particular product or service (e.g. buying a new vacuum cleaner or trying a new restaurant), how do you decide if you want to try that product or service?  If a product or service has ratings, do those influence your decision?

  - When you're looking at ratings, what aspects do you pay close attention to (e.g. number of stars, number of people who rated it)?  
  - Are there any aspects that aren't important to you?  
  - Why are these aspects important or not important to you?
  - How heavily do ratings influence your ultimate decision?
  - What helps you decide if a rating or review is trustworthy?
  
- Are there any particular sites that you frequently visit that use ratings?  What do you like about these sites?
- Have you ever looked at sites to compare schools?  
   - If yes, which ones?  What did you like about those sites?

## Categories - 10 minutes
- Some sites like Amazon allow users to rate a product or service on a variety of factors such as product quality, timeliness of delivery, etc.  If there were similar ratings for schools you were interested in attending, what categories would be of interest to you?

- Is there any other information that you would like to know from Veterans who had attended a school you were interested in?

- Who do you think should be able to submit ratings for a school?
 - Someone who applied and was accepted 
 - Someone who applied and was rejected
 - Someone who attended classes, but didn't complete their degree
 - Someone who finished their degree

- (As applicable) In terms of school ratings, there are a few categories I would like to get your feedback on.  What do you think the category is talking about and would it be helpful in your decision making process?
  - Institution Overall
  - Quality of Classes
  - Veteran Friendliness
  - Employment Preparation
  - Recruiting/Marketing Practices

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
