# School Ratings Discussion Guide


*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we would like to talk about what information is helpful to Veterans when determining if a particular school would be a good fit for them.  Specifically, if the VA asked Veterans who had attended a particular school to give feedback on a school, what information would prospective students want to know?
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 50 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?" 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.
 - Are you currently using or have you ever used your GI Bill education benefits?
   - If yes, when did you start school?
   - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future?
 - Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?  

*Background info about the participant should have been provided by Coordinator already, so use this time to ask any other questions that you feel will help with the session. This warm-up is not required*

## Education Journey - 10 minutes

- When you were looking at a potential school to attend, what information about that school do you typically look for?
- Did you ask anyone for advice or feedback about that school?
    - If yes, what did you ask?
- When you think about ratings or reviews on schools, what comes to mind?
- Do you think reviews are helpful?
- What helps you decide if a rating or review is trustworthy?
- For any particular school, who do you think should be allowed to provide a rating?  Who would you like to hear from the most?
 - Someone who applied and was accepted 
 - Someone who applied and was rejected
 - Someone who attended classes, but didn't complete their degree
 - Someone who finished their degree
- What type of information would you want from these individuals?
- Amazon allows users to rate a product on a variety of factors: product quality, timeliness of delivery, etc.  If you wanted to see a variety of ratings for schools, what categories would be of interest to you?
- Would you expect to see the date the review was submitted?
- Would you expect to see any information about the person submitting the rating?

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
