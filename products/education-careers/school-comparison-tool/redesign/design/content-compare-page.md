    { learn more modal, Learn more aria label: "Learn more about the different accreditation types and why it matters" }
    
    #### Accreditation and why it matters
    
    The goal of accreditation is to ensure the education provided by institutions of higher learning meets acceptable levels of quality. Accreditation matters if you plan to start school at one institution and transfer to another to complete your degree. Be sure to ask any potential school about their credit transfer policy.
    
    Schools are accredited regionally or nationally by private educational associations. While the Department of Education (ED) doesn't say whether regional or national accreditation is better, a recent ED study revealed that, “Nearly 90 percent of all student credit transfer opportunities occurred between institutions that were regionally, rather than nationally, accredited.” [Read the ED report on credit transferability](http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2014/2014163.pdf).

    #### GI Bill students
    
    The number of Veterans, service members and family members using their GI Bill benefits attending this school in the last calendar year. This includes all chapters of the GI Bill program (e.g., Post-9/11, Montgomery GI Bill, Reserve Education Assistance Program, and Veteran Readiness and Employment). Keep in mind that differences in attendee numbers don’t necessarily mean one school is more military friendly than another. This information will be updated annually.

    {Size of institution modal, Learn more aria label: “Learn more about institution size”}
    
    #### Size of institution
    
    The size of institutions is based on calculation of full-time equivalent students (FTEs) which considers both full-time and part-time students. Two-year colleges are classified using a different scale than four-year and higher institutions. 
    
    Two-year college sizes
    •	Very small  -- fewer than 500 FTEs attend this institution
    •	Small  -- at least 500 but fewer than 2,000 FTEs attend
    •	Medium -- at least 2000 but fewer than 5,000 FTEs  
    •	Large -- at least 5,000 but fewer than 10,000 FTEs attend  
    •	Very large -- 10,000 or more FTEs attend  
    
    Four-year college sizes
    •	Very small -- fewer than 1,000 FTEs attend this four-year institution
    •	Small -- at least 1,000 but fewer than 3,000 FTEs attend
    •	Medium -- at least 3,000 but fewer than 10,000 FTEs attend
    •	Large -- more than 10,000 FTEs attend

    The Yellow Ribbon Program can help you pay for out-of-state, private school, or graduate school tuition that the Post-9/11 GI Bill doesn’t cover. Schools that choose to participate in the Yellow Ribbon program will contribute a certain amount toward the extra tuition. VA will match the participating school’s contribution, up to the total cost of the tuition and fees.

    The [Principles of Excellence](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2012-05-02/pdf/2012-10715.pdf) are guidelines for educational institutions receiving federal funding. Schools that agree to participate will:
    
    •	End fraudulent and aggressive recruiting techniques and misrepresentation.
    •	Provide students with a personalized form covering the total cost of an education program.
    •	Provide educational plans for all military and Veteran education beneficiaries.
    •	Provide accommodations for service members and Reservists absent due to service requirements.
    •	Assign a point of contact for academic and financial advising.
    •	Make sure all new programs are accredited before they enroll students.
    •	Align institutional refund policies with those under Title IV.
    
    Foreign schools, high schools, on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs, residency and internship programs, and those who don’t charge tuition and fees aren’t asked to comply with the Principles of Excellence.

    We try to make sure this information is accurate, but prospective students should only use this as a planning tool. Principles of Excellence schools are updated quarterly.

8 Keys to Veteran Success (Learn more)

    #### 8 Keys to Veteran Success
    
    The “8 Keys to Veterans’ Success” are steps that postsecondary institutions can take to assist Veterans and service members in transitioning to higher education, completing their college programs, and obtaining career-ready skills.
    
    Postsecondary institutions listed here have stated their support for the 8 Keys. However, this isn’t an assurance by the U.S. Department of Education that an institution has actually implemented the 8 Keys. It also doesn’t mean that these institutions are endorsed by the U.S. Department of Education.
    
    To learn more about accreditation, visit the U.S. Department of Education’s [8 Keys to Veterans’ Success page](Link to http://www.ed.gov/veterans-and-military-families/8-keys-success-sites).
