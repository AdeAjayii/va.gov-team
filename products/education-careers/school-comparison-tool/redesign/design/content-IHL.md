VA will match the participating school’s contribution, up to the total cost of the tuition and fees. 

Veterans and Fry Scholarship and Purple Heart recipients, or their dependents using transferred benefits, are eligible for the maximum benefit rate. Active-duty service members and their spouses aren’t eligible for this program. (An active-duty service member’s dependent child using transferred benefits may be eligible if the service member is qualified at the 100% rate.)

### Protection against late VA payments

If VA is late making a tuition payment to a GI Bill school, the school can’t prevent a GI Bill student from attending classes or accessing school facilities. 

Schools may require students to provide proof of their GI Bill eligibility in the form of:

*	Certificate of Eligibility (COE) **or**
*	Certificate of Eligibility (COE) and additional criteria like an award letter or other documents the school specifies

**In addition, schools can't charge late fees or otherwise penalize GI Bill students if VA is late making a tuition and/or fees payment.** This restriction on penalties doesn't apply if the student owes additional fees to the school beyond the tuition and fees that VA pays. Students are protected from these penalties for up to 90 days from the beginning of the term. 

Contact the School Certifying Official (SCO) to learn more about the school’s policy. [Read our policy on protecting students from late VA payments](https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/fgib/transition_act.asp).

### About ratings 

We ask Veterans who have used their education benefits to rate schools they’ve attended on a scale of 1 to 5 stars, with 5 stars being the best rating. 

#### How ratings are collected

VA works independently to collect ratings from Veterans. We reach out to Veterans to provide a rating who have:
- Received a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) for benefits
- Transferred into or out of a school 
- Made a change to their program of study, **or**
- Completed their degree program 

Veterans rate schools on a number of categories. Those ratings are averaged to calculate the overall school rating. If a Veteran doesn’t rate a category, it has no effect on the category’s overall score. 

#### Veteran privacy

A school may ask us for a list of Veterans who rated their school, but we do not share individual ratings with schools. If an institution asks us for information on who rated their school, no information beyond what is publicly available on the Comparison Tool is shared with them that would tie an individual to their ratings.
