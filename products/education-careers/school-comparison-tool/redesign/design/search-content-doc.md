          ### Cautionary warnings and school closings

          VA applies caution flags when we, or another federal agency, have increased regulatory or legal scrutiny of an educational program. We recommend students consider these warnings before enrolling in flagged programs.

          When VA receives notice that a school or campus location will be closing, we add a school closing flag to that profile. Once the closing date passes, we remove the institution from the Comparison Tool during the next system update.

          To learn more about caution flags, visit the About this Tool page.

          ### Accreditation and why it matters

          The goal of accreditation is to ensure that the education provided by institutions of higher education meets acceptable levels of quality. Schools can be accredited by private educational associations of regional or national scope.

          Accreditation matters if you plan to start school at one institution and transfer to another to complete your degree. Be sure to ask any potential school about their credit transfer policy.
