    #### Tuition and fees

    VA pays all tuition and fees for the VET TEC program directly to the training provider.

    If you’re participating in a VET TEC program, you’ll have the same annual tuition and fees cap as students attending a private institution under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. If your tuition and fees exceed that cap, you’ll be responsible for paying those.

    Preferred Provider training programs aren’t subject to a cap on tuition and fees.

    To help ensure that Veterans find jobs, VA pays VET TEC training providers in three installments based on the progress and success of their Veteran students.

    Training providers receive:
    * An initial 25 percent of tuition and fees when the Veteran enrolls and begins attending the program
    * Another 25 percent when the Veteran completes their training
    * The remaining 50 percent once the Veteran secures meaningful employment in their field of study

    #### 8 Keys to Veteran Success

    The “8 Keys to Veterans’ Success” are steps that postsecondary institutions can take to assist Veterans and service members in transitioning to higher education, completing their college programs, and obtaining career-ready skills.

    Postsecondary institutions listed here have stated their support for the 8 Keys. However, this isn’t an assurance by the U.S. Department of Education that an institution has actually implemented the 8 Keys. It also doesn’t mean that these institutions are endorsed by the U.S. Department of Education.

    To learn more about accreditation, visit the U.S. Department of Education’s [8 Keys to Veterans’ Success](http://www.ed.gov/veterans-and-military-families/8-keys-success-sites) page.

    #### Principles of Excellence

    The [Principles of Excellence](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2012-05-02/pdf/2012-10715.pdf) are guidelines for educational institutions receiving federal funding. Schools that agree to participate will:

    * End fraudulent and aggressive recruiting techniques and misrepresentation.
    * Provide students with a personalized form covering the total cost of an education program.
    * Provide educational plans for all military and Veteran education beneficiaries.
    * Provide accommodations for service members and Reservists absent due to service requirements.
    * Assign a point of contact for academic and financial advising.
    * Make sure all new programs are accredited before they enroll students.
    * Align institutional refund policies with those under Title IV.

    Foreign schools, high schools, on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs, residency and internship programs, and those who don’t charge tuition and fees aren’t asked to comply with the Principles of Excellence.

    We try to make sure this information is accurate, but prospective students should only use this as a planning tool. Principles of Excellence schools are updated quarterly.
