  **Tuition and fees**

  VA pays all tuition and fees for the VET TEC program directly to the training provider.

  If you’re participating in a VET TEC program, you’ll have the same annual tuition and fees cap as students attending a private institution under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. If your tuition and fees exceed that cap, you’ll be responsible for paying those.

  Preferred Provider training programs aren’t subject to a cap on tuition and fees.

  Training providers receive:
  * An initial 25 percent of tuition and fees when the Veteran enrolls and begins attending the program
  * Another 25 percent when the Veteran completes their training
  * The remaining 50 percent once the Veteran secures meaningful employment in their field of study
