# Research Plan for CT Redesign - Search, Compare and Initial Profile Page
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
  - Booz Allen research for Education Service / OIT
  
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?

 - The Booz Allen team conducted extensive research with Comparison Tool users and stakeholders to identify their needs and challenges when researching schools to attend. This research resulted in recommendations that focused on optimizing search functionality, incorporating information and functionality that facilitate school selection, and encouraging prospective students to take the next step in their education journey.  From these recommendations, initial designs for the search, comparison and school profile pages were created and now need to be tested to validate their effectiveness.
  
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 

- Researchers believe that users will be able to effectively search for schools using the new design.  Additionally, we believe that users will be able to easily find and utilize the comparison functionality and be successful at using the new navigation options on the school profile pages.

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing with high-fidelity prototypes 	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 
  - Remote moderated usability testing will allow us to assess a user's ability to complete basic, but critical functionality on the tool that has been redesigned.  We will be able to see what the user looks at, clicks on and how they expect the functionality to work.  It also allows researchers to ask questions about what the user is thinking as they are completing the tasks to gain better insight into their thoughts, actions and expectations.
3.	Where are you planning to do your research?
      - Online using Zoom 	
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 
    - We will be testing the design, content and flow of the prototype
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use	
 - Zoom
