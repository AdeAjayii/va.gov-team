## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about searching and comparing schools on the GI Bill Comparison Tool. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - X minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you currently using or have you ever used your education benefits?
     - If yes, which benefit are you using?
          - When did you start school? Where did you go?
     - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future?
          - Which benefit?
          - Where are you in the school selection process?
                    
 - When you were first looking for schools, how did you go about finding potential options? What was important to you?

- Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?
     - If yes, what did you use it for?


## First Task: Degree / Program Search - 10 minutes

- Let's say you've recently heard of someone who received an education in **Ethical Hacking** (other options:  Bakery Science, Puppet Art). You don't know of any schools that offer this program, but it's something that sounds interesting.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to see if any schools covered by the GI Bill offer this as a program of study?

_ You see that **Insert school with Ethical Hacking program** is highly rated by Veterans. If you wanted to ask the School Certifying Official a few questions abou the school, how would you go about finding their contact information?


### Things to watch for:

Part 1
- Where does the user look to enter the field of study?
- Do they click the search fields?
- What dropdowns (if any) do they open?
- Do they open the "Level of degree" dropdown?

Part 2
- Does the user click any of the jumplinks or just scroll?


## Second Task: Radius from Location - 15 minutes

- While you're waiting to hear back from the SCO, you decide to look for schools in your area.  Let's say you live in **Daytona, Florida**.  Traffic is okay, but you don't really want a long commute every day, so you would like to find a school within 30 miles of your location.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to find schools that are within that driving distance?

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

## Third Task: [TASK NAME] - X minutes

- Step 1
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Question 1
- Question 2
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
