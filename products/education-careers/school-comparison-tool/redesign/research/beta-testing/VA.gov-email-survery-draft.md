**SUBJECT LINE: User Experience Research Studies - Invitation to Participate (Study Name)**

Hello,

The VA.gov team at the Department of Veterans Affairs is running a user research session to test an updated design of the GI Bill Comparison Tool.

We're seeking individuals to test a redesign of the tool. We want to understand whether individuals can find schools and other educational opportunities using the tool and determine whether those options are a good fit for them.


**What will I be doing in this session?** 

We’ll send you two links. The first link will take you to a prototype of the GI Bill Comparison Tool where you’ll perform a few basic tasks.

Once you’re done “testing” the Comparison Tool, the second link will take you to a survey where we’ll ask about your experience with the tool. To receive compensation, you must complete both activities.

 

**How long is a session?** 
These activities should take you no more than 30 minutes to complete.  We’ll send you an email with instructions and the links you’ll need.  
 

**Interested in participating?** Please reply to this email to receive the study links and a participation code. After you complete the activities, we'll send your compensation of $25 within 1-2 weeks.


**Process**

\1.	You respond to this email letting us know you’d like to participate.
\2. We’ll schedule the first 10 individuals that match our recruiting criteria. 
\3. We’ll email instructions with links to the activities and a participation code.
\4. You complete the activities and enter your participation code in the survey.
\5. We’ll deliver your compensation via check within 1-2 weeks.
