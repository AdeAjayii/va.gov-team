# Research Plan for Compare Functionality for CT Redesign
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	 	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

- Booz Allen research for Education Service/OIT

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

- The Booz Allen team has been working on a re-design of the GI Bill Comparison Tool. One of the major updates for the re-design was to add functionality to enable users to compare schools. The team has created this new functionality and would like to test the design with users to see how well it performs.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 

- Researchers believe that users will be able to easily find, select and compare schools that they are interested in.  We believe that the fields being compared are important to users and will be useful in determining which school they would like to attend.

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing in a staging environment	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
 - Remote moderated usability testing will allow us to observe how users interact with the compare functionality. We will be able to see what the user looks at, clicks on and how they expect the functionality to work. It also allows researchers to ask questions about what the user is thinking as they are completing the tasks to gain better insight into their thoughts, actions and expectations.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
 - Online using Zoom
 
4.	What will you be testing?
 - We will be testing the design, content and flow of the screens.
 
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
 - Zoom
 
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
 - Recruitment will be performed by Perigean Technologies
	

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
 - June 16 - 18th, 2021
 
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? 
 - June 14th, 2021
 
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 
 - 45 minutes
 
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 
 - June 14th, 2021
