**SUBJECT LINE: User Experience Research Studies - Invitation to Participate (Study Name)**
Hello,
The VA.gov team at the Department of Veterans Affairs is running a user research session. 
We are seeking individuals to test a redesign of the GI Bill Comparison Tool. We are looking to assess how easily individuals can find educational institutions, learn more about those institutions, and compare them against other institutions.  Your feedback will help us build a better product.

**What will I be doing in this session?** You will be sent two links. The first link is to a prototype of the GI Bill Comparison Tool. The second link is to a survey, where we will ask you questions about your experience engaging with the tool. To receive compensation, you must complete both activities.

**How long is a session?** The session is self-guided and should take you 30 minutes to complete the activity. 
Interested in participating? Please reply to this email to receive the study link and a participation code. After completing the online activity, we'll send your compensation of $25 for completing the study.

**Process**

\1. We will schedule the first 10 individuals that can match the criteria and timeslots.

\2. We will email you the links and a participation code.

\3. Once you complete the card sorts, your compensation will be delivered via check within 1-2 weeks.
