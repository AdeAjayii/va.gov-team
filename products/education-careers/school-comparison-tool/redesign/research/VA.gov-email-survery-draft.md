**SUBJECT LINE: User Experience Research Studies - Invitation to Participate (Study Name)**
Hello,
The VA.gov team at the Department of Veterans Affairs is running a user research session for the GI Bill Comparison Tool.

We're seeking individuals to test a redesign of the GI BIll Comparison Tool. We're looking to understand whether individuals can find schools, employers, and training providers in the tool and then learn about them.  

Your feedback will help us build a better product.


**What will I be doing in this session?** You will be sent two links. The first link will be to a prototype of the GI Bill Comparison Tool. The second link will take you to a survey, where we'll ask you questions about your experience engaging with the tool. To receive compensation, you must complete both activities.

**How long is a session?** The activity is self-guided and should take no more than 30 minutes to complete. 
Interested in participating? Please reply to this email to receive the study links and a participation code. After you complete the activity, we'll send your compensation of $25 within 1-2 weeks.

**Process**

\1. We will schedule the first 10 individuals that can match the criteria and timeslots.

\2. We will email you the links and a participation code.

\3. Once you complete the activity, your compensation will be delivered via check within 1-2 weeks.
