## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jen and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about finding schools on the GI Bill Comparison Tool. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- Are you currently using or have you ever used your education benefits?
     - If yes, which benefit are you using?
         - When did you start school? Where did you go?
     - If no, do you plan on using your benefits in the near future? 
         - Which benefit?
         - Where are you in the school selection process?

- Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?
    - If yes, what did you use it for?

- When online, some websites let users view search results in either a list or a map view. Have you ever used the map view to see your results?
    - If yes, when do you typically use the map?  What were you looking for?  Which sites? 


## First Task: Location Search - 15 minutes

- Let's say you recently moved to **San Antonio, TX** and you're curious what education options are available to you. You aren't sure what you want to study, but wanted to see what was in the area.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to see what education options were in your area? 

_Prompt_ 
- For you personally, what type of education options would you be interested in? Do these options meet that criteria?
- Do you think these benefit estimates are correct for your situation?

### Things to watch for:

- What search criteria format does the participant use (city, "city, state", "use my current location" etc)?
- Does the participant use the autocomplete?
- Does the user notice the "Update housing and tuition" accordion?

### Upon task completion:
 - How did you think that went?
 - On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of finding educational institutions?
 - Looking at the benefits listed on the school cards, do you think these benefit numbers accurately represent what you would receive?  
       - If not, how would they go about determining what benefits they would receive?


 - How do you think the school search results were sorted?
 - Was there any other information you were expecting to see?
 

## Second Task: Expand search - X minutes

- You found some good opportunities in San Antonio, but you know that Austin is just northeast of San Antonio and would be a manageable commute - particularly any programs that were in the southern part of the city.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to see if there were any programs offered in the south  


### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

### Upon task completion:
 - How did you think that went?
 - On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of finding educational institutions?

## Third Task: Map Utilization - X minutes

- You like several institutions you've seen in both San Antonio and Austin.  To help narrow down your search, you're interested to see which institutions in those cities have the Yellow Ribbon program.  How would you use the Comparison Tool to identify institutions in San Antonio and Austin who have the Yellow Ribbon program? 

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

### Upon task completion:
 - How did you think that went?
 - On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very easy and 5 is very hard, what did you think of finding educational institutions?

## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Question 1
- Question 2
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
