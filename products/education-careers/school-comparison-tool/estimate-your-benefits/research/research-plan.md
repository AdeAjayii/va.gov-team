# Research Plan for Estimate Your Benefits
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
- Booz Allen research for Education Services / OIT
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	
 - GIBCT users who are estimating benefits, especially those with accessibility challenges or those on mobile devices, may not detect the changes they’re making to the estimated benefits on Profile Pages because those changes could be happening outside their field of view.  This situation is exacerbated because the changes currently happen automatically upon modification of inputs; this is an accessibility issue and the design needs to be modified to make changes occur upon a button click.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?
- #### Desktop - General:
- What do users think of the calculator categories (e.g. interest in opening them)?
- Is calculating benefits easier or harder with the new design?  Which design do users prefer?
- When making changes in several accordions, do users go back and check previous accordions to see if changes are holding?
- What do users think of the automatic closing of accordions?
- Do users click calculate for every accordion or just once after all changes are made?
- When do they expect changes to be made (as they are making them or after clicking Calculate)?
- When users click Calculate, do they notice which values have changed?
- Do users realize they can change “Your benefits” values on Search Results page?

- #### Desktop - Assistive Tech:
- How well can users navigate the EYB section using assistive devices?
- What parts of the interface frustrate the user (e.g. accessing any inputs, movement of the focus, etc.)?
- How easy is it for users to make selections and recalculate benefits on assistive devices?

- #### Mobile:
- Do users open and close the bottom sheet?  If so, how?
- What are user thoughts on the bottom sheet (e.g. helpful, obstructive, indifferent)?
- Do users like that the sheet only appears within the EYB section?
- What do users think of the values shown in the bottom sheet (collapsed and expanded)?
- Do users expect bottom sheet numbers to update as they make selections?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 
- #### Desktop: 
 - Grouping the inputs into accordions and adding a button to initiate the re-calculation of benefits will help users better understand and engage with inputs while simultaneously resolving the accessibility issue.
 - #### Mobile:
 - Incorporating a bottom sheet into the Estimate Your Benefits section will help users understand the purpose of the section and provide a more engaging interaction.
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote, moderated usability testing in a demo or staging environment using Zoom	or WebEx
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
  - There are several concerns with this section - the current layout does not allow the user to see changes they are making and the automatic updating of the benefits panel is an accessibility concern.  Numerous changes have been made to address these issues - including a new pattern for mobile users.  Researchers need to determine if the proposed solutions fix the accessibility issue and that users understand and can effectively utilize the re-design of the desktop version and the new mobile design pattern.
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 	
 - Online using Zoom or WebEx
4.	What will you be testing? 
- Desktop:  Page, content and accessibility
- Mobile: New design pattern  	
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
  - Zoom or WebEx
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	
- 14-20 participants 
- GI Bill beneficiaries who have used, are currently using or plan to use their GI Bill benefits in the next 12 months

A mix of the following:
- 4 - 6 GI Bill beneficiaries with access to a desktop computer 
- 4 - 6 GI Bill beneficiaries with access to a desktop computer who regularly use a screen reader or magnifier for web browsing. 
- 6 - 8 GI Bill beneficiaries with access to a mobile device

Age Range: 18-45

Geography: Geographically dispersed across US

VA Benefit requirement: Ch 33, Post-9/11 GI Bill or Ch 31 (Vocational Rehabilitation) Education benefits

Technology: Access to a computer, preferably running Google Chrome browser; Assistive technologies (for some); Access to a mobile device (for some)

Familiarity with technology: Any

Accessibility preference: 2-3 participants using screen reader or magnifier for web browsing

Login requirements: None
2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact UX lead.)	
## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
 - May 13 - 14, 2020 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
- By COB on May 8, 2020
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 
 - 1 hour
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? 
- Wednesday, May 13th from 8 AM - 6 PM
- Thursday, May 14th from 8 AM - 6 PM
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	
  - May 12, 2020
