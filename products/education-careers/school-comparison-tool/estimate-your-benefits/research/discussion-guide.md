# Estimate Your Benefits Usability Testing Discussion Guide

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to take a look at the GI Bill Comparison Tool.  Specifically, we're looking at how to calculate your GI Bill benefits for schools within the Comparison Tool.

Before we get started, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I don't want to keep you much longer than that, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- During this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I won't be offended by any opinions you express and welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we finish analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  - If yes: Great - thank you.  Once I start recording, I'll ask again so we have your audible confirmation.
  - If no: Ok. My team will just observe and take notes as we go. 

Start recording.
- 	I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

### Setting up Screen reader & Sharing

For our next step, I'd like you to share your screen and screen reader audio with me. 

In Zoom, can you select the Share button?

On this next screen, let's go with the default selection. 

Also, there is a checkbox in the Share Screen option that says "Share computer sound." This will let us hear your screen reader.  Can you make sure that it's checked and select "Share"?

*Confirm that the screen reader is audible.
*Confirm that screensharing works.  If it doesn't work immediately, suggest they restart the screen reader (order of operations isn't typically isn't critical) 

### Checklist for Screen Reader Participants
- 	Are you using a computer or mobile phone during our session today? Mac or Windows? iOS or Android?
- 	What browser are you using today?
- 	Are you using a screen magnifier today?
- 	Do you have the latest version of Zoom (4.3.1) installed? Check under Zoom > About.
- 	Which screen reader are you using today?
- 	Are you wearing headphones today? If so, would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? I'm asking so that I can hear your screen reader during the session.
- 	Would you mind setting your screen reader to its default speed? We want to accurately hear and record what you’re experiencing on VA.gov.
- 	Do you know your screen reader's verbosity setting? High, medium, low? Is that your standard setting (or do you tend to change it depending on what you're working with)?


## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 10 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1.	Are you currently using or have you ever used your GI Bill education benefits?
2.  Where are you currently in your education journey?
3.	Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?
- If yes, fantastic! 
  - When do you think the last time you used it was? 
  - What were you looking for? 
  - Do you recall how you first learned about it? 

### For Screen Reader Participants

Okay. Now I'd like you to open a new browser window or tab.

I have a website I want you to visit - I can send you the link via chat in Zoom or I can spell out the Url - which would you prefer?

 - Fill in link here

### For Desktop non-Screen Reader Participants

For our session today, I'm going to give you a couple tasks to do online. While you're going through them, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.

When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way.

I'm going to give you control of my screen & mouse. I'll pass control to you and you should receive a message that prompts you to control the screen. 

## First Task:  - 15 minutes

You have a friend who had to take a loan back in 2018 due to late VA payments to their school.  You know that the VA has taken steps to keep this from happening again, but that schools may require certain documentation from you to attend classes if the payments are late.  You’re interested in attending **Midland University in Fremont Nebraska**, how would you use the Comparison Tool to find what information Midland University requires?

Things to watch for:
-	Where does the user initially look for the information?
-	Does the user look under the Institutional Summary section?
-	What, if any, interest does the user show in the “Protection against late VA payments” modal information?
-	Does the user click on the modal for more information?
-	Screen reader: how does the user move throughout the page? (quick tabbing through options, listening to every control/element, etc.)
-	Screen reader: how does the user interact with modals?

Upon completion of task: How did you think that went? 

## Second Task: Section 103 Content - 10 minutes
{ Get participant to 103 indicator }

As you're reviewing the information in this area of the page, could you tell me what “Protection against late VA payments” means to you?
-	Have you heard of a Certificate of Eligibility before?  If so, when? Have you submitted one before?
-	Do any other questions come to mind about this?

## Third Task: Additional Criteria - 5 minutes
Let's say you are also interested in attending **Chadron State College in Chadron, NE** and are curious about their requirements for obtaining protection against late VA payments.  How would you go about determining those requirements for this school?
  - What do you think “additional criteria” is?
  - How would you go about finding out more information?

Things to watch for:
-	Does the user click on the modal?
-	Does the user search around anywhere else looking for more information on “additional criteria”?

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
-	Do you have general thoughts or feedback on the Comparison Tool that you’d like to share? 
-	We had you look for information on delayed VA payments within the GI Bill Comparison Tool.  If this situation arose in real life where do you think you’d look for information on how to deal with this issue? 
-	Any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, thanks so much and enjoy the rest of your day!
