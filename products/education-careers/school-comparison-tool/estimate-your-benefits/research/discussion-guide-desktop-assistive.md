# Estimate Your Benefits Usability Testing Discussion Guide - Desktop Assistive Tech

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to take a look at the GI Bill Comparison Tool.  Specifically, we're looking at how to calculate your GI Bill benefits for institutions and programs within the Comparison Tool.

Before we get started, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about 50 minutes. I don't want to keep you much longer than that, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- During this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I won't be offended by any opinions you express and welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we finish analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  - If yes: Great - thank you.  Once I start recording, I'll ask again so we have your audible confirmation.
  - If no: Ok. My team will just observe and take notes as we go. 

Start recording.
- 	I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?

### Setting up Screen reader & Sharing

For our next step, I'd like you to share your screen and screen reader audio with me. 

In Zoom, can you select the Share button?  On this screen, let's go with the default sharing selection. 

There's a checkbox on this Share Screen that says "Share computer sound." This will let us hear your screen reader.  Can you make sure that it's checked and select "Share"?

* Confirm that the screen reader is audible.
* Confirm that screensharing works.  If it doesn't work immediately, suggest they restart the screen reader (order of operations isn't typically isn't critical) 

### Checklist for Screen Reader Participants
- 	Are you using a computer or mobile phone during our session today? 
  - Computer: Mac or Windows? Phone: iOS or Android?
- 	What browser are you using today?
- 	Are you using a screen magnifier today?
- 	Do you have the latest version of Zoom (4.3.1) installed? Check under Zoom > About.
- 	Which screen reader are you using today?
- 	Are you wearing headphones today? If so, would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? I'm asking so that I can hear your screen reader during the session.
- 	Would you mind setting your screen reader to its default speed? We want to accurately hear and record what you’re experiencing on VA.gov.
- 	Do you know your screen reader's verbosity setting? High, medium, low? Is that your standard setting (or do you tend to change it depending on what you're working with)?


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1.	Are you currently using or have you ever used your GI Bill education benefits?
- (If applicable) When did you start school?  Where are you going to school?
2.  How did you (or would you) find out what benefits VA provides for your education and housing?
3.	Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?
- If yes, fantastic! 
  - When do you think the last time you used it was? 
  - What were you looking for? 
  - Do you recall how you first learned about it? 
- If no, no worries.  We're checking that out today and always appreciate getting a fresh perspective on it.


Okay. Now I'd like you to open a new browser window or tab. 

I have a website I want you to visit - I can send you the link via chat in Zoom or I can spell out the URL - which would you prefer?

As you work through the task, if you have any comments or questions, feel free to let us know. 

## First Task: Calculate Benefits at School / IHL - 15 minutes

You are considering attending **UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-BERKELEY** for data science. You want to know what costs - including tuition, fees, that kind of thing - are covered under the Post 9/11 GI Bill. How would you use the Comparison Tool to find out what benefits you would receive if you were going to attend University of California-Berkeley?

_Potential prompt:_ Let’s say you received $3000 from your local Rotary Club to help fund your education. How would you go about factoring in that money? 

Things to watch for:
- How does the user select the school (School name or View Details)?
-	Where does the user initially look for their benefit information?
- How often and after what actions are users viewing “Estimate your benefits” panel to track changes there?

Accordions
- Does the user engage with the accordions without prompting? 
-	Which accordions does the user open?
- When making changes to inputs located in several accordions, do users go back and check previous accordions to see if changes are holding?

Calculate button
- Do users click calculate for every accordion or just once after all changes are made?
- When users click Calculate, do they notice which values have changed?
- When do users expect re-calculations to occur (as they are making them or after clicking Calculate)?

-	Assistive: How well can users navigate the EYB section using assistive devices?
-	Assistive: Are there any parts of the interface that the user struggles with (e.g. accessing any inputs, movement of the focus, opening accordions, etc.)?
- Assistive: What do users think of the process of making selections and recalculatingWhat are user thoughts on the bottom sheet (e.g. helpful, obstructive, indifferent)?

**Upon completion of task:**
- How did you think that went? 
- Were you able to find what you were looking for?  Did it seem like anything was missing?
- On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very hard and 5 is very easy, how would you rate this task?
- Do you have any questions about the benefits you would receive at this school?

**Accordions:**
Let's take a look at the Estimate Your Benefits part of the page.
- What did you think of the accordions (Your benefits, Learning format and schedule, Scholarships and other funding)?  
- What did you think of how the questions were grouped together?
- When you were clicking through the accordions, what did you think about how they opened and closed?


## Second Task: OJT or VET TEC - 10 minutes
OJT - A friend of yours told you that **RAGING WIRE DATA CENTER in Sacramento, CA** provides on-the-job training for Veterans in data science.  Can you find that data center and let me know what benefits you would receive if you trained with this employer?

VET TEC - A friend of yours told you that **GALVANIZE INC** is a VET TEC training provider with a program in San Francisco, CA for data science.  Can you find that provider and let me know what benefits you would receive if you took this program?

Things to watch for:
- How does the user navigate to this program/employer?
-	What, if any, fields do they change within the EYB section?
- How often and after what actions are users viewing “Estimate your benefits” panel to track changes there?

**Upon completion of task:** 
- How did you think that went? 
- What did you think of this information versus University of California?
- Were you able to find what you were looking for?  Was anything missing?
- Do you have any questions about the benefits you would receive at this school?
- On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very hard and 5 is very easy, how would you rate this task?


## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
Those were all the tasks I had for you today. 

-	Do you have general thoughts or feedback on the Comparison Tool that you’d like to share? 
-	Any questions for me?
- I want to give a chance to the other people on the line to ask a question.

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 

If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, thanks so much and enjoy the rest of your day!
