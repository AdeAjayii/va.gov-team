# Product Outline - Caution Flags - PI7 
---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
- Maintenance of the Caution Flags & their Mappings is challenge for the development and for Education Services
- All caution flags appear the same and it is difficult for users to differentiate between the type and criticality of Caution Flag

- How might we improve the maintainability of caution flags within the Comparison Tool?
- How might we more effectively communicate caution flag information to users?


## Desired User Outcomes
- Comparison Tool users are able to understand the impact of caution flags on their school selection.
- Comparison Tool users are able to make good decisions on whether or not to attend schools with caution flags.
- Comparison Tool users are able to distinguish between different types of caution flags
- Education Services is able to manage the caution flags with fewer files within GIDS. 
- Education services has guidance on how to effectively write caution flag content so that it is consistent with VA.gov language and so the message of the caution flag is clear for Comparison Tool users. 
- Education Services is able to manage Caution Flag display without development intervention. 

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Caution flag content is not clear 
- Comparison Tool Users attend schools with major caution flags

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Applications to institutions and schools with caution flags decreases 
- Applications and payments of GI Bill benefits to institutions with caution flags decreases. 
- Fewer people looking at profile pages with caution flags (this outcome will be more specific/updated as we gather information about the categorization of caution flags)

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Applications and payments of GI Bill 
- Schools complaints increase because they have more caution flags. 
- Legal action is threatened by schools due to caution flags. 
- Maintenance of the tool still requires development intervention
- Maintenance of the tool still requires the same number of files to be uploaded
