## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. The purpose of today's session is for you to successfully submit an application for the VA's STEM Scholarship using the 22-10203 form on VA.gov. To reiterate what we've likely already discussed during our earlier sessions, the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship provides up to nine months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (to a maximum of $30,000) to qualifying Veterans and Fry Scholars seeking an undergraduate STEM degree or who have earned a STEM degree and are seeking a teaching certification.

Before we get started, I want to begin by thanking you for your willingness to participate in this session. Your participation allows us to ensure that other veterans who will be using this form in the future will have a good experience. 

**IF THE PARTICIPANT IS NOT ELIGIBL**
As we begin, I want to note that there are a number of warnings built into the form that discourage ineligible participants from applying. Today, we'd like you to ignore those warnings because our goal is to test the application all the way through submission, but feel free to talk through what you would do if that was not the goal of this session. 

A few more things I want to mention:

- **There are a few other individuals on the line observing.** They are watching for any errors that arise in the application system during the application process. 
- **This entire session should take no more than 30 minutes.** 
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We will not be offended by any opinions you express, and we welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
