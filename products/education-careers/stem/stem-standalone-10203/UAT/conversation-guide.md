## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about [description of your project]. 

First of all thank you for your willingness to participate in this session. Your participation allows us to ensure that other veterans who will be using this form in the future will have a good experience. The form you’ll be completing is an application for the Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship that provides up to nine months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (to a maximum of $30,000) to qualifying Veterans and Fry Scholars seeking an undergraduate STEM degree or who have earned a STEM degree and are seeking a teaching certification.

For today’s session we’d like to have you submit your own STEM Scholarship application by walk through the application process yourself. There are no right or wrong answers or ways of completing the application. We also encourage you to think out loud so we can better understand your perspective.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **There are a few other individuals on the line observing.** They are watching for any errors that arise in the application system during the application process. 
- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?
