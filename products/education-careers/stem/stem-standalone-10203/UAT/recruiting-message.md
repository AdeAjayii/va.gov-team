# Recruiting Message - Standalone STEM Scholarship Form - 22-10203

## Generic Message

Good morning! I am looking for Veterans using Post-9/11 (Chapter 33) benefits and Fry Scholars who might be interested in applying for the VA’s Edith Nourse Rogers STEM Scholarship. The scholarship extends benefits for individuals who are pursuing a bachelor’s degree program for science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM), or have already earned a STEM bachelor’s degree and are pursuing a teaching certification.

We will be launching a new version of the scholarship application on VA.gov in August and are looking for people to participate in our initial limited rollout.

You can email me at turner_desiree@bah.com if you’re interested. Please feel free to share with your network as well. 

Thank you!
