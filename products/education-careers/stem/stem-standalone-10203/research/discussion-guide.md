# STEM Usability Testing Discussion Guide 

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to take a look at the GI Bill Comparison Tool.  Specifically, we're looking at how to calculate your GI Bill benefits for institutions and programs within the Comparison Tool.

Before we get started, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I don't want to keep you much longer than that, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- During this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I won't be offended by any opinions you express and welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we finish analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  - If yes: Great - thank you.  Once I start recording, I'll ask again so we have your audible confirmation.
  - If no: Ok. My team will just observe and take notes as we go. 

Start recording.
- 	I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1.	Are you currently using or have you ever used your GI Bill education benefits?
- (If applicable) Where are you going to school?  What are you getting a degree in?
2. Are you familiar with the Rogers STEM scholarship?
3.	Have you ever used the GI Bill Comparison Tool before?
- If yes, fantastic! 
  - When do you think the last time you used it was? 
  - What were you looking for? 
  - Do you recall how you first learned about it? 
  - If no, no worries.  We're checking that out today and always appreciate getting a fresh perspective on it.


For our session today, I'm going to give you a couple tasks to do online. While you're going through them, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.

When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way.

I'm going to give you control of my screen & mouse. I'll pass control to you and you should receive a message that prompts you to control the screen. 

## First Task: Apply for STEM - 15 minutes

You've heard about a scholarship that the VA offers called the Rogers STEM scholarship and are curious if you could receive this scholarship while going to schoool. How would you use this form to look into and potentially apply for the Rogers STEM scholarship?

STEM-eligible:
Program Details page Prompt - for this dropdown list, which option would you pick for the program you are taking?

Non-STEM eligible:
Upon discovering they are not eligible - what would you do at this point?

Things to watch for:
- Does the user look at the subway map?
-	Do any questions cause confusion or require additional research for users to answer?
- Does the user try to skip any questions?
- Does the user click the Additional Info component "What if I don't have a bank account?"?

Non-STEM only:
- How do users react to alerts and warnings about eligibility?



**Upon completion of task:** 
- How did you think that went? 
- On a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very hard and 5 is very easy, how would you rate this task?



## Second Task: Ivy League school - 10 minutes

You know that the Post 9/11 GI Bill covers Ivy League schools like Brown University, Harvard, Yale, Dartmouth, Princeton.  Let's say you wanted to know what costs would be covered at one of those schools.  Pick an Ivy League school of your choice and see what benefits you would receive at that institution.
  
  Things to watch for:
  - How often and after what actions are users viewing “Estimate your benefits” panel to track changes there?
  
  Upon completion of the task:
  - How do the benefits at this school compare to what you'd get at UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-BERKELEY?



## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Those are all the tasks I have for you today. 

-	Do you have general thoughts or feedback on the Comparison Tool that you’d like to share? 
-	Any questions for me?
- I want to give a chanced to the other people on the line to ask a question.

## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, thanks so much and enjoy the rest of your day!
