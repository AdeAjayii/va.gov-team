# STEM Usability Testing Discussion Guide - Round 2

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Amy and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to take a look at the application for a new scholarship for Post-9/11 GI Bill beneficiaries.  

Before we get started, a few things I want to mention:
- This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I don't want to keep you much longer than that, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- During this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We're not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I won't be offended by any opinions you express and welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

We will be working in a prototype so some functionality will not work as expected. For example, when you click on a field, an answer or selection may pre-populate or alternatively, you may click on something and nothing may happen.  In those cases, I'll let you know that the functionality isn't working and ask what you would expect to happen.

Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are deleted after we finish analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

  - If yes: Great - thank you.  Once I start recording, I'll ask again so we have your audible confirmation.
  - If no: Ok. My team will just observe and take notes as we go. 

Start recording.
- 	I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.

1.	Are you currently using or have you ever used your VA education benefits?
    - Which benefit?
2.  Do you know roughly how much of your education entitlement you have left?  
3. Are you familiar with the Rogers STEM scholarship?
 - If yes, what have you heard about it?
 - If no, as a quick summary of the scholarship, the Rogers STEM Scholarship provides up to nine months of additional Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (to a maximum of $30,000) to qualifying Veterans/Fry Scholars seeking an undergraduate STEM degree or who have earned a STEM degree and are seeking a teaching certification.


For our session today, I'm going to give you a couple tasks to do online. While you're going through them, it would be really helpful if you'd think aloud - kind of like you'd do if you were talking to yourself. We are interested in your first reactions, what you're thinking & wondering as you go through the process. The more you say about what you are thinking and wondering, the more we’ll learn.

When you think aloud, it helps us understand what works well and where we might want to make improvements to make things even easier. If you have questions, it’s likely that many other Veterans will, as well, so feel free to ask them along the way.

I'm going to give you control of my screen & mouse. I'll pass control to you and you should receive a message that prompts you to control the screen. 

Note:  Each participant will go through ONE of the tasks below.

## Task 1: Authenticated User with Too Much Entitlement - 15 minutes

We're going to do some role playing.  Let's say you're Sammy Smith and you're using the **Post 9/11 GI Bill** to obtain an undergraduate degree in **Chemistry** from **Chicago State University**. How would you go about filling out this application?  You will log in as an authenticated user.


*When eligibility alert appears*

- What did you think of the eligibility alert message you saw?  Would you still apply?

You (Sammy) contacted the VA about his entitlement and discovered that they are currently experiencing a glitch in their system.  You actually have 3 months of entitlement left and the VA told you to continue filling out the application and disregard the eligibility alert while they fix the system. 

*When school information appears*
- What did you think of the pre-population of school information?  What would you do if the information wasn't right?

Things to watch for:
- Does the user read the subway map?
- Does the user experience any confusion in determining how to start the application? (Need to scroll to bottom of page)
- How does the user react to the eligibility alert message (entitlement)?

**Upon completion of task**
- In your personal field of study, would you expect to be eligible for this scholarship?
- In terms of applying for this scholarship, on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very hard and 5 is very easy, how would you rate this task?


##  Task 2: Unauthenticated User that is Not Chapter 33 - 15 minutes

We're going to do some role playing.  Let's say you're Cameron Caldwell and you're using the **Montgomery GI Bill** to obtain an undergraduate degree in **Chemistry** from **Chicago State University**. You don't currently have an account and aren't interested in creating one.  How would you go about filling out this application?  

*When eligibility alert appears*
- What did you think of the eligibility alert message you saw?  Would you still apply?

Things to watch for:
- Does the user read the subway map?
- Does the user experience any confusion in determining how to start the application? (Need to scroll to bottom of page)
- How does the user react to the eligibility alert message (wrong benefit)?


**Upon completion of task**
- In your personal field of study, would you expect to be eligible for this scholarship?
- In terms of applying for this scholarship, on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very hard and 5 is very easy, how would you rate this task?

## TASK 3: Authenticated User in non-STEM program - 15 minutes

We're going to do some role playing. Let's say you're Jordan Johnson and you're using the **Post 9/11 GI Bill** to obtain an undergraduate degree in **Philosophy** from **Chicago State University**. How would you go about filling out this application?  You will log in as an authenticated user.

*When eligibility alert appears*

- What did you think of the eligibility alert message you saw?  Would you still apply?
  
  Things to watch for:
  - Does the user read the subway map?
  - Does the user experience any confusion in determining how to start the application? (Need to scroll to bottom of page)
  - Does the user check the Approved STEM programs document?
  - How does the user react to ineligibility alert?
  - If they click "Check remaining benefits", what would you expect to happen (e.g. modal, new page, etc.)? 

**Upon completion of task:**
  - In your personal field of study, would you expect to be eligible for this scholarship?
  - In terms of applying for this scholarship, on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is very hard and 5 is very easy, how would you rate this task?

  
## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes

Circle back on
- School contact details - Is your school ID the same as your SSN?  If applicable, what would you put down for your school email?


Those are all the tasks I have for you today. 

-	Do you have general thoughts or feedback on the application that you’d like to share? 
-	Any questions for me?
- I want to give a chanced to the other people on the line to ask a question.


## Thank-You and Closing - 3 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, thanks so much and enjoy the rest of your day!
