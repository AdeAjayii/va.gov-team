# Questions to explore with VA stakeholders

### Reviewing STEM Scholarship Applications
* What are the team's impressions on how the updated 22-1995 form is performing?  What's the current rate of application rejections? 

### Chapter 33 Benefits
* In the event the applicant is a Post-9/11 GI Bill beneficiary AND a Fry Scholar, would the benefit periods run sequentially? 
* If the user was previously Chapter 33, but is now using a non-Chapter 33 benefit, would they remain eligible for the Rogers STEM Scholarship?

### School, STEM Program & CIP Code
* What information about the STEM program does the team in Buffalo need to research the application? 
* How does the Buffalo team anticipate understanding what school the student is attending for the new program? 
* What level of granularity is required for the program name & CIP Code?
  * Does Education Service / Buffalo have ideas how to request the CIP code? 
  * Beside text field, what are other ways we might request the CIP code from the user to capture what Buffalo needs?   
* How often are CIP codes updated? 
* How often might the relevant programs (and corresponding CIP codes) for the Rogers STEM Scholarship be modified?   

### When do you plan to start your training? 
* The question "Provide the date you plan to or will start training" appears on the form.  Is this asking when the student first began their STEM program, when their next semester begins or another question altogether?
* Could you receive STEM retroactively for classes you're already taking?  (Does the field need to allow for dates in the past?)
 
### Credit Hours
* For credit hours, are these hours the total number of hours a student has, or just the ones that apply to the degree they are pursuing?

### Teaching Certification
* If the student is seeking a teaching certification, one requirement is that they must have completed a post-secondary degree in a STEM field.  Are there any requirements for this post-secondary degree?  (For example, can this post-secondary degree be an Associate's Degree?)  **The degree has to be a STEM undergraduate degree**  
* Are users pursuing teaching certifications required to provide similar information as undergraduate students, such as the name of their program, type of program they're pursuing, CIP code, indication of whether program is semester / quarter, and/or credit hours remaining?
