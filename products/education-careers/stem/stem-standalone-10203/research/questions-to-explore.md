# Questions to explore with VA stakeholders

### School, STEM Program & CIP Code
* What information about the STEM program does the team in Buffalo need to research the application? 
* What level of granularity is required for the program name & CIP Code?
  * What are other ways that we could request the CIP code from the user that would capture what Buffalo needs?   
* How does the Buffalo team anticipate understanding what school the student is attending for the new program? 
* The question "When do you plan to start your training?" appears on the form.  Is this asking when the student first began their STEM program, when their next semester begins or another question altogether?
 

### Credit Hours
* Are the credit hour requirements also applicable to those pursuing a teaching certification?
* For credit hours, are these hours the total number of hours a student has, or just the ones that apply to the degree they are pursuing?

### Teaching Certification
* If the student is seeking a teaching certification, one requirement is that they must have completed a post-secondary degree in a STEM field.  Are there any requirements for this post-secondary degree?  (For example, can this post-secondary degree be an Associate's Degree?)  **The degree has to be a STEM undergraduate degree**
