# Research Plan for STEM - Round 2
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	
## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	
- Booz Allen research for Education Services / OIT
2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

Currently, Veterans applying for the Rogers STEM Scholarship to extend their CH33 benefits must use the 22-1995 form (Request for Change of Program or Place of Training). The addition of STEM scholarship questions to this form was a temporary solution while decisions on a stand-alone form were made.

During the initial implementation of the STEM Scholarship application as part of the 22-1995, an issue arose where a high number of ineligible people (>80% of applicants) were applying for the scholarship, resulting in significant work for the application processors. Steps were taken to address that as part of the 22-1995, and an integral part of the new form is to continue to drive the number of ineligible submissions down.

To address the above, the STEM Scholarship application was re-designed and tested with users.  Testing showed that the application was easy for applicants to fill out, but a few recommendations were made to further improve the design.  Changes included providing an applicant's remaining entitlement to them earlier in the process and revising some content to make the application requirements clearer.  These recommendations have been incorporated into the design and researchers need to test the effectiveness of the revisions.

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 

  - Do unauthenticated participants know to scroll to the bottom of the intro screen to start the application?
  - Do authenticated participants know to scroll down to the bottom of the intro page to start application?
  - How do non-chapter 33 participants react to the additional (new, benefit-specific) summary page?
  - How do participants who aren't eligible based on being enrolled in a non-STEM program react to eligibility alerts?
  - Do users have questions surrounding the prefill of school data? (School name, city, state)
  - For ineligible participants, how many say they would still apply? Why?
  - For ineligible participants, where do they think they should land when they leave the form on non-eligibility summaries?
  
  Entitlement:
  - Is the entitlement warning alert on the intro page effective at deterring ineligible applicants from beginning the application?
  - Are entitlement warning alerts effective at deterring ineligible applicants from submitting an application [eg. alert on STEM summary page]?
  - Do applicants expect a grace period (beyond the 6 months)?
  - What, if any, modifications are needed for entitlement check functionality to ensure it is effective?
  

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	
 - When a user is ineligible, the user will realize or be informed of their ineligibility early in the process and will not want to apply.
 
## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - Remote moderated usability testing 	
  	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?
  - Researchers need to watch users interact with the form and see their reaction to alerts and content changes to ensure that changes made to the original design are effective.  
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? 
- Online using Zoom
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
- We will be testing content and flow using high fidelity prototypes
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)
  - Zoom 
  
## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
- July 7 - 9, 2020 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 	
- 30 minutes
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.
