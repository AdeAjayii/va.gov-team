# Research Plan for STEM Scholarship Application (for 22-10203) enhancements
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	

## Goals	
1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	This research plan is related to the rollout of updates to the STEM Scholarship that will 
  1. Display remaining entitlement to applicants who are logged in and have supporting EVSS entitlement data
  2. Upon submission of eligible applications, SCOs for the institution most recently associated with the applicant will receieve an email notification so that they can preemptively begin the process of supplying the VA with data necessary to validate the scholarship application. 
2. Background: This functionality was determined post-MVP from the initial 22-10203 form launch in September 2020 due to issues related to coordinating with and testing against EVSS. Since then, DEPO has approved the approach of launching and testing these two features in Production because we are unable to test this in the lower environments. 
3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	Do these two features work as expected for Veterans, SCOs, and the STEM application processing team?
4. Hypothesis: The features do work as expected. 

## Method	
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	
  - **Sample Methodologies**: Observation of remote moderated user acceptance testing 	
2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? Observing applicants as they move through and submit the application will allow us to observe and capture any unexpected behavior or errors that arise during user acceptance testing. 
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? Webex Web Conferencing
4.	What will you be testing? Production application
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use? Webex


## Participants and Recruitment	
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

We want to recruit 6 participants that meet the following criteria: 
- Willing to submit an application for the Rogers STEM Scholarship (https://www.va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits/stem-scholarship/)
- 6 months or less of entitlement remaining or have exhausted their education benefits (can be validated here: https://www.va.gov/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/ch-33-benefit/)
- Have remaining Post-9/11 (Chapter 33) GI Bill Education Benefits
   - OR have exhausted their Post-9/11 (Chapter 33) GI Bill Education Benefits
   - OR or are a Fry Scholar (https://www.va.gov/education/survivor-dependent-benefits/fry-scholarship/)
- Have previously been enrolled or are currently enrolled in an education institution using GI Bill education benefits

And 6 more participants that meet the following critieria: 
- Willing to submit an application for the Rogers STEM Scholarship (https://www.va.gov/education/other-va-education-benefits/stem-scholarship/)
- Remaining Post-9/11 (Chapter 33) GI Bill Education Benefits or are a [Fry Scholar](https://www.va.gov/education/survivor-dependent-benefits/fry-scholarship/)
- More than 6 months of entitlement remaining (can be validated here: https://www.va.gov/education/gi-bill/post-9-11/ch-33-benefit/)
- Have previously been or are currently enrolled in an education institution using GI Bill education benefits

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?
None

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
- Draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean 
- Draw from professional relationships in existing networks

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
Testing will take place between 10/26 and 11/6
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
It is ready right now (10/08)
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 
Sessions should take no longer than 1 hour. We would like a 15 minute buffer between sessions. 
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?
Monday - Friday 8:30AM-4:00PM EST; If more flexibility required please let me know (turner_desiree@bah.com)
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	
Thursday 10/22 or Friday 10/23
