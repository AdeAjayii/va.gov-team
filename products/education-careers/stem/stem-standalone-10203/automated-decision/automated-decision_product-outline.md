# Product Outline - STEM Scholarship Application Automated Decision
---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement
### Problem #1: Ineligible STEM applicants are spending time to submit applicantions for the scholarship because the burden to do so is so low and the potential reward is so high.
**Who** STEM applicants
**What** Ineligible STEM applicants are spending time submitting applications and waiting for a decision 
**Why** The burden to complete the application is low and the potential reward is high
**Where** 

### Problem #2: The STEM application processing team has historically received a large number of ineligible STEM applications which takes time away from the team's ability to review and process eligible applicants
**Who** STEM application processing team
**What** The application processing team has historically received a large number of ineligible STEM applications
**Why** This has been problematic because it delays the team's ability to review and process eligible applicants 
**Where**

### How might we allow ineligible applicants to apply while protecting the time of the application processing team?

## Desired User Outcomes
- All interested users are able to apply for the scholarship
- Ineligible applicants get an immediate decision

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Users are frustrated by an automated decision (feeling the human review experience allows for exceptions to the rules where appropriate)

## Desired Business Outcomes
- Application processing team no longer has to review ineligible STEM applications

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- Applicants change their answers on the applicant to appear eligible and the processing team still ends up reviewing them
