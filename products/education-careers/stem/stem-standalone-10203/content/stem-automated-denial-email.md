- As of XX/XX/XXXX, you have more than 6 months of Post 9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) benefits remaining.  By law, all Rogers STEM Scholarship recipients must have used all of their Post 9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) benefits or be on track to exhaust them within 6 months of applying (Public Law 115-48, Section 111 (b)).  If you enroll in a subsequent term and have less than 6 months of benefits remaining, please re-apply at that time.

- You do not meet the degree requirements for the Rogers STEM Scholarship (Public Law 115-48, Section 111(b)). By law, all Rogers STEM Scholarship recipients must either be:
   (1) enrolled in an eligible STEM undergraduate degree
   (2) currently have an eligible STEM undergraduate degree and be pursuing a teaching degree.
 
 The Rogers STEM scholarship application asks the following questions to determine degree eligibility.  Applicants must answer "Yes" to one of these questions to be considered eligible.
    - "Are you enrolled in a science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) degree program?"
       - You answered: No
    - "Do you have a STEM undergraduate degree and are now pursuing a teaching certification?"
       - You answered: No
