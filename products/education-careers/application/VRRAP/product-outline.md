# VRRAP Product Outline
---

## Overview
*After you've explored the problem and through testing / hypothesis have identified the ideal solution, write up one sentence describing the solution you'll be creating.*

## Problem Statement

Thousands of Veterans are unemployed due to COVID-19.  Veterans who meet 6 specific criteria are eligible for VRRAP (Veteran Rapid Retraining Assistance Program) funding to retrain in high-demand careers. To apply for VRRAP funding, they need to submit an application through VA.gov and the Muskogee RPO will develop the claims.  The VRRAP program will run only 21 months so time to design and build the application is precious.   

How might we allow Veterans to apply for VRRAP benefits -- following VA.gov styles and collecting vital information for the Muskogee RPO -- on a very tight timeline?   

 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Applicant understands and is confident of their eligibility when they apply
- Applicant knows what to expect when the application is submitted
- Applicant receives a relatively fast response to their application


## Undesired User Outcomes

- Potential applicants aren't sure if they're eligible so they apply
- Potential applicants aren't sure if they're eligible so they don't apply
- VRRAP applicants don't understand why they're ineligible
- VRRAP applicants quit other job training opportunities to take advantage of the VRRAP program


## Desired Business Outcomes

- More than 17,000 Veterans have been retrained by the end of the program (17.250 max)
- $386 million in VRRAP funding is exhausted
- VRRAP applications average review time is below **some acceptable amount of time** 
- VRRAP application rejection rate is within an acceptable range (**Less than 50%?**)  

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Rejection rate is greater than 50% (**TBD: work with Muskogee to define**)
- Muskogee RPO is overwhelmed with applications lacking detail needed to develop claims
- Timeline to decide claims creates delays funding Veterans' training

## Measuring Success


### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |  17,250 Veterans are retrained in high-demand careers         |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |  $386 million is spent on VRRAP training programs                  |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*
- Clear requirements are provided
- For requirements that are unclear, there is flexibility or collaboration to define
- OMB approval process can run in parallel and won't be a blocker to launch 

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*
