## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 
1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
   1. Ideally, the form would be split into multiple chapters
   2. We're awaiting results of the our accessibility review. If anything significant is identified we will want to prioritize those issues.
