# Product Outline for Education Benefit Application Updates due to Isakson-Roe Legislation

---

## Overview
Several applications for education benefits are being updated to conform to [Isakson-Roe legislation](https://benefits.va.gov/gibill/isaksonroe.asp) expanding benefits and to better map with their paper-form counterparts.   

## Problem Statement
Several education benefit application forms are now out of date due to the newly passed legislation.   

How might we update the forms to be compliant with legislation and align with the print versions of the forms?
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- Users will have the latest information on their benefits, which are expanded under the new legislation.

## Undesired User Outcomes

- Users have confusion about the differences in the forms

## Desired Business Outcomes

- Business is in compliance with federal laws.

## Undesired Business Outcomes

- Business has to handle confusion users may have with updated content. 

---
## Measuring Success

* Users will continue to submit each form at the current rate -- or even increased rates. 

---

## Assumptions
- Form updates are focused on the legislative changes and select business requests only.  
- No additional "improvements" have been made to the forms such as retro-fitting of new design components, extensive QA / accessibility testing on original functionality. 

## Solution Approach

- Work with business to ensure we have all the current information on the legislative updates and their desired updates beyond legislation. 
- Clarify any issues which are confusing or unclear
- Review any areas of concern WRT design or content with relevant VSP teams
- Design, Develop, QA, Deploy 

--- 

## Go-to-market Strategy
- Form updates are enhancements to existing forms for transfer of benefits.  These are widely used benefit applications.
