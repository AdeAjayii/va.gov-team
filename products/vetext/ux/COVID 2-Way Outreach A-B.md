# COVID 2-Way Outreach Initial Message A/B Testing (March 2021)

Goal: In an effort to improve response rate and schedule rate for COVID vaccine appointments, we are reevaluating the language in the initial outreach message in the COVID 2-Way Direct Scheduling workflow, and testing it against the existing message in small batch tests within a single site. 

## March 9-10, 2021
Shorten message, move action step to end of message for increased visibility. 

### March 9, One site, ~5000 messages per condition.

**Results:** 
B performed worse than A by a statistically *insignificant* 12.42% on successful scheduling, and better by a statistically *insignificant* 2.99% on response rate.

A (current message):
> %FACILITY_NAME% is offering COVID-19 vaccines to Veterans who receive care at VA.  
> 
> To schedule an appointment, please reply with a date and time you would be available from %START_DATE% to %END_DATE%
> 
> Please respond within 24 hours. More info about COVID-19 vaccines: https://go.usa.gov/xASD8  Send STOP to end messages.

B (reordered, shortened message): 
> You can now get a COVID-19 vaccine at %Facility_Name%. More info about COVID-19 vaccines at VA: https://go.usa.gov/xASD8
> 
> To schedule your first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, reply to this message within 24 hours. Send us a text with a date and time you're available from %start_date& to %end_date%.

### March 10, One site, ~5000 messages per condition.

**Results:** 
B performed worse than A by a statistically significant 27.37% on successful scheduling, and worse by a statistically significant 27.61% on response rate.

## March 11
Hypothesis: The addition of VAX and PASS response options for the initial message would improve Veteran experience by 1) reducing the number of Veterans who receive a message that is mismatched with their situation,Â  and 2) increasing response rate due to clear response options for folks who are not interested in scheduling. 

### March 11, One site, ~5000 messages per condition.

**Results:** 
B performed better than A by a statistically significant 175.34% on response rate, and B performed worse by an insignificant 6.74% on successful schedule.

A (current message):

B (added responses for VAX and PASS)
> %FACILITY_NAME% is offering COVID-19 vaccines. To schedule an appointment, please reply with a DATE & TIME you would be available from %START_DATE% to %END_DATE%
> 
> If you have already received, or are scheduled to receive, the vaccine: Reply VAX
> If you are not interested at this time: Reply PASS
> 
> More info about COVID-19 vaccines: https://go.usa.gov/xASD8 Send STOP to end messages.
