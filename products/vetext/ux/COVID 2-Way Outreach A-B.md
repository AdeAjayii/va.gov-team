# COVID 2-Way Outreach Initial Message A/B Testing (Spring 2021)

Goal: In an effort to improve response rate and schedule rate for COVID vaccine appointments, we are reevaluating the language in the initial outreach message in the COVID 2-Way Direct Scheduling workflow, and testing it against the existing message in small batch tests within a single site. 

## March 9-10, 2021
Shorten message, move action step to end of message for increased visibility. 

### March 9, One site, ~5000 messages per condition.

A (current message):
> %FACILITY_NAME% is offering COVID-19 vaccines to Veterans who receive care at VA.  
> 
> To schedule an appointment, please reply with a date and time you would be available from %START_DATE% to %END_DATE%
> 
> Please respond within 24 hours. More info about COVID-19 vaccines: https://go.usa.gov/xASD8  Send STOP to end messages.

B (reordered, shortened message): 
> You can now get a COVID-19 vaccine at %Facility_Name%. More info about COVID-19 vaccines at VA: https://go.usa.gov/xASD8
> 
> To schedule your first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, reply to this message within 24 hours. Send us a text with a date and time you're available from %start_date& to %end_date%.

**Results:** 
B performed worse than A by a statistically *insignificant* 12.42% on successful scheduling, and better by a statistically *insignificant* 2.99% on response rate.

**Results:**

## March 11
Hypothesis: The addition of VAX and PASS response options for the initial message would improve Veteran experience by 1) reducing the number of Veterans who receive a message that is mismatched with their situation,Â  and 2) increasing response rate due to clear response options for folks who are not interested in scheduling. 

### March 11, One site, ~5000 messages per condition.

A (current message):
> %FACILITY_NAME% is offering COVID-19 vaccines to Veterans who receive care at VA.  
>
> To schedule an appointment for your first dose, please reply with a date and time you would be available from %START_DATE% to %END_DATE%
> 
> Please respond within 24 hours. More info about COVID-19 vaccines: https://go.usa.gov/xASD8  Send STOP to end messages.
> 

B (added responses for VAX and PASS)
> %FACILITY_NAME% is offering COVID-19 vaccines. To schedule an appointment, please reply with a DATE & TIME you would be available from %START_DATE% to %END_DATE%
> 
> If you have already received, or are scheduled to receive, the vaccine: Reply VAX
> 
> If you are not interested at this time: Reply PASS
> 
> More info about COVID-19 vaccines: https://go.usa.gov/xASD8 Send STOP to end messages.

**Results:** 
B performed better than A by a statistically significant 164.81% on response rate, and B performed worse by an insignificant 6% on successful schedule.

**Next Actions:**
National 2-way direct schedule messages were updated to include VAX/PASS options. Extended to include one-way week of Mar 21.

## March 16, 2021
Hypothesis: Adding "VA: Hi %PATIENT_FIRST_NAME%" to beginning of message will add personalization and validity to message, increasing overall response rate.

### March 16, One site, ~5000 messages per condition.

A (current message):
>
>  %FACILITY_NAME% is offering COVID-19 vaccines. To schedule an appointment, please reply with a DATE & TIME you would be available from %START_DATE% to %END_DATE%
> 
> If you have already received, or are scheduled to receive, the vaccine: Reply VAX
> 
> If you are not interested at this time: Reply PASS
> 
> More info about COVID-19 vaccines: https://go.usa.gov/xASD8 Send STOP to end messages.

B (added VA: Hi, Firstname):
>
> VA: Hi, %PATIENT_FIRST_NAME%, %FACILITY_NAME% is offering COVID-19 vaccines. To schedule an appointment, please reply with a DATE & TIME you would be available from %START_DATE% to %END_DATE%
>

## April 2, 2021
Hypothesis: Adding example date / time format to message will increase user confidence, overall response rate, and schedule rate.

### April 2, One site, ~5000 messages per condition.

A (current message):
>
> You can now get a COVID-19 vaccine at %FACILITY_NAME%
>
> To schedule an appointment, please reply with a DATE & TIME you would be available from %START_DATE% to %END_DATE%.
>
> If you have already received, or are scheduled to receive, the vaccine: Reply VAX 
> If you do not plan to receive the vaccine: Reply PASS

B (added example date/time):
>
> You can now get a COVID-19 vaccine at %FACILITY_NAME%
>
> To schedule an appointment, please reply with a DATE & TIME you would be available from %START_DATE% to %END_DATE%. For example, "0900 15 Oct".
>
> If you have already received, or are scheduled to receive, the vaccine: Reply VAX 
> If you do not plan to receive the vaccine: Reply PASS
> 

**Results:** 
B performed better than A on scheduling in one step by a statistically significant 188.89%, and performed _insignificantly_ better or worse on all other measures observed.
