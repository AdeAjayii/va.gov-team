## Feature background
Today, VA.gov interfaces directly with Carma (Salesforce) for 10-10CG form submissions. In the future, VA.gov will no longer connect directly to Carma. Instead, VA.gov will connect to Mulesoft, which in turn will connect to Carma. 

User story: As a va.gov user I would like to know when my online 10-10CG has been successful so I don't resubmit duplicates.
