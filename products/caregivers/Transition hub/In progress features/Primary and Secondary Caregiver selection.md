## Feature background
The sign as a representative feature enables a representative with authority to make health care decisions for the Veteran to sign the application on behalf of the Veteran. A representative must upload a document that proves that they have legal authority to make health care decisions for the Veteran.



## UX research 
Unrelated usability research studies have shown that users are unclear the difference between a Primary and Secondary Caregiver. A big reason for this is that the selection to apply for each of these is separated.
