This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

In general, participants seemed to find the 10-10EZ's length acceptable, but research indicates confusion, that could lead to drop-offs, caused by question wording, information architecture, and design details, outlined below.

## Introduction
During [Discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/Research%20April-May%202021/End%20user%20discovery%20research/research%20findings.md) we found that many participants did not want to take the time to read the Introduction as it was quite long. The majority of the participants in that research study went straight to the "Start the application" button. This is a distinct contrast with what we saw in this study that utilized the shortened Introduction and the button that is moved to the bottom. In this study the majority of participants read the entire introduction, commenting that it is clear and prepares them well for what they will need in the application.

**Introductions prepared participants well for what they will need during the application process**
- Many

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"



**Because people are now reading the Introduction more thoroughly, some participants wondered why they were not asked for certain documents that were listed in the "Gather your information" section of the Introduction, and some would have spent unnecessary time looking for those documents before starting**
- Many

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"

**Some participants find the repeated Introduction (upon sign in reduntant and/or confusing)
- Many

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"



## Variation 1: Applying to health care benefits, 50% or higher disability rating is known at sign in (participant has a disability rating of 50% or higher)
Overall the participants had a general understanding of the short form

**The majority of participants feel that this flow is much quicker and easier than they expected**
- Many

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"


**All participants shown this variation understood what the "short form alert" at application start meant and moved through the flow naturally without barriers**
- Many

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"



**All participants shown this variation understaood what a "short form" is and why they received it**
- Many

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"




## Variation 2: Applying to health care benefits, 50% or higher disability rating is known at self-report, VA compensation question 
Overall participants worked through this flow without confusion or barriers.

**The majority of participants feel that this flow is much quicker and easier than they expected**
- Many

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"

**Some participants were confused about the steps numbers and why the number changed (upon entering into the short form)**
- Many

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"


**All participants shown this variation understaood what a "short form" is and why they received it**
- Many

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"

**About half of participants interacted with the "Green accordion alert," and this resulted in some uncertainty as to what information was skipped**
- Because participants that are shown this variation have only the potential of 1-2 questions remaining in the flow after being put on the short form track, they have very little time to interact with the green accordion alert before finishing the application. About half the time it went unnoticed and/or was not interacted with.

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"

**The "current compensation question causes confusion for more than half of the research participants**
- Many participants thought that they receive both service-connected pay for a 50% or higher disability rating and VA pension, thus were confused which one to choose. All who felt this confusion did select 50% or higher disability rating, but thought this should allow for a multi-checkbox. Many participants thought that VA pension is for people who retired from the VA itself. Some participants wondered why they couldn't just disclose their disability rating itself. One participant suggested that there be a link to check their disability rating.

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"




## Variation 2.2: Applying to health care benefits, 50% or higher disability rating is known at self-report, VA compensation question - updated alert design and messaging 
Overall participants moved through this flow smoothly, many barely noticed the confirmation page and alert as different. 


**The majority of particpants felt like the alert set proper expectations

- All participants saw the alert, and felt positively to know that were on step 3 of 4. They expected that the remaining questions would simply be questions that the VA needs to confirm or doesn't already have on record.

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"


**Some participants thought that this alert meant that the VA had identified them and that their profile was then linked**

- All participants saw the alert, and felt positively to know that were on step 3 of 4. They expected that the remaining questions would simply be questions that the VA needs to confirm or doesn't already have on record.

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"

## All variations:

**The Insurance information "Other coverage" page caused uncertainty for many participants, especially for those who have Tricare (through military retirement)**
Althought none of the participants thought this question would stop them from submitting the form. The main confusion was in the Policy number and Group number inputs. They were uncertain if they would use their Social Security number for this. Additionally, many participants did not read the part of the label that specifies that only the policy number **or** the group code is required. Some said they would just make one up, others said that they might contact the VA for help. One participant said that they would just say that they did not have other coverage because they wouldn't want the VA to give them less coverage.

**On the review page some participants were confused or had questions as to why they had not been asked for some of the documents listed on the Introduction "Gather your information" section of the Introduction page.

- Although none of the participants thought that this uncertainty would prevent them from submitting the applicaiton, some expressed that they would be left with a little doubt, and thought that they might have to provide it later. This was mostly in regards the military discharge paperwork and the income information. One participant thought that they would also like to provide their medical history information although this is not something listed on the Introduction page.

> "I arr"

> "I was deni"

**Some participants think that because of this alert that they will be enrolled upon submission of the form**
