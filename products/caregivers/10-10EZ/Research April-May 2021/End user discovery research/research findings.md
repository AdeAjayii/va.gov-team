## Research Goals 

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Better understand why some Veterans choose to not apply for health care benefits.
- Better understand why Veterans start the application, but don’t complete it.
- Gain human understanding behind the sections that the analytics show high drop-off rates.
- Better understand context, environmental factors, and user behaviors, and feelings about the Health Care application.
- Run a general check of the application’s usability and the users’ understanding of the content and why they must provide the information that it asks for.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted 1 pilot + 8 participant remote moderated task analysis and contextual interview discovery sessions via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to explore the usability, potential drop-off points, and general sentiment around the 10-10EZ Health Care application in staging, and assses the sections that [Analytics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HDGBx-whUrSArDLf8OP_-65lCMPi36h0ihHPA3XqmIk/edit#slide=id.p1) show high drop-off rates as well as general usability of the application.

**Note:** Though our [Research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/Research%20April-May%202021/End%20user%20discovery%20research/research-plan.md) requested the following recruitment, due to a general confusion of health care benefits separate from other benefits, most of our participants did not meet these specifications:
 
 All participants must be yes to one of the following qualifications:

  - Started the Health Care application (10-10EZ) in the last 6 months, but did not complete it.
or

  - Is currently considering (or has in the past) applying for healthcare through the VA.
or

  - Applied for VA healthcare in the last 6 months.




### Research Questions

The research questions we sought to address: 
- What experiences (personal, social, and medical) bring the user to fill out the application?
  - What other places did the user consider/ turn to for healthcare (outside of the VA)?
- How well does the introduction prepare users to understand what they need in order to apply?
- Within the application form, what section(s) stop users from completing the form?
- Does the task analysis reflect similar drop-off points as the analytics?
- Why do financial sections have the highest drop-off rate?
  - Does the user understand why financial information must be provided?
- What outside factors does the current form overlook? 

## Key Findings

**General**
1. Most Veterans do not differentiate the nomenclature of the VA benefits and health care, they are all "VA benefits" to them.
2. Participants feel that the VA should already have much of the information that the VA Health care application requests.
3. Participants worry that their answers to some questions could automatically disqualify them from VA Health care.
4. The majority of participants say that they would be more likely to answer sensitive questions and be more understanding of the effort to answer the questions if there was transparency as to why the question is being asked and how it will be used to determine their VA Health care eligibility.
5. There is uncertainty about how the applicant will receive updates on their application status and a desire to be able to specify preferred contact method.
6. The form progress is unclear. This is due to the inconsistent progress bar advancement and use of same titles on multiple pages.
7. There is a need to rewrite many questions in plain language and to provide more explanation of the questions.
8. There is a need to rethink the hierarchy flow and ensure that only required questions are asked, including creating more dependencies. 

**Specific sections**
1. Service history section information architecture provides no indication of the relationship of the items on this list, thus causing confusion when choosing answers and causing fear of inelgibility.
2. The household information section (includes financial disclosure information) was the most likely to be stated as the hardest part of the application, stemmed by uncertainty on how to find the requested information, unclarity of what the questions were asking, how their responses would impact their application.
3. Preferred facility question does not provide optimal UX especially for applicants who have many facilities in their state. Additionally, the "Find locations with the VA Facility Locator" (when noticed) was noticed after the participant had already looked through the drop-down menu, thus it was a delayed help for them.
4. Medicaid and Medicare related questions don't provide enough details for the participants to confidently provide answers.


## Details of Findings

### The redesigned "question page" where participants answer if they want to upload documentation overall worked well, participants were much more comfortable moving through it [than in the previous round of testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md)
Because the question now centers around asking to upload legal representative documents or not, it did not create a barrier for those participants who did not have Power of Attorney (POA) documents or POA itself. 



## Additional Insights
* Many Caregivers live with the Veteran and/or use their contact information in place of the Veteran's, in the future it might be nice to consider having a checkbox to select the same address, phone, and email to avoid writing the same thing twice.

* Learn more about who qualifies as a Primary/Secondary Caregiver (additional info component)

    * The same people (relations) are listed for both Primary and Secondary, thus this does not help people understand the difference.

    * The list does not match the dropdown list that the user must use to select the relationship of Caregiver to Veteran.

* One participant expressed concern about the Social Security number showing fully on the Review page as she often uses public computers.
    * "I would close it (review accordion) immediately if I saw my Social Security number and address appear on the screen."

## Recommendations
* Implement upload documentation question into the workflow

* Add additional content/example to help users understand what qualifies as a legal representative document

* Explore more options for the signature page

In the future
* Keep the new language for Primary/Secondary Caregiver, but improve the user experience by rethinking both the structure and copy of the question pages, potentially combining them and adding additional information about what each role entails and what the benefits are for each.
* Consider putting medical facilities question on their own page or clarifying language about what is required or optional.

## Next Steps

* Upload page
  - Implement copy tweaks

* Explore options for the representative signature box
