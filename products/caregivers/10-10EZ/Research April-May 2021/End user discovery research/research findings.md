## Research Goals 

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Better understand why some Veterans choose to not apply for healthcare benefits.
- Better understand why Veterans start the application, but don’t complete it.
- Gain human understanding behind the sections that the analytics show high drop-off rates.
- Better understand context, environmental factors, and user behaviors, and feelings about the Health Care application.
- Run a general check of the application’s usability and the users’ understanding of the content and why they must provide the information that it asks for.

## Research Methodology 

We conducted 1 pilot + 8 participant remote moderated task analysis and contextual interview discovery sessions via Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method allowed us to explore the usability, potential drop-off points, and general sentiment around the 10-10EZ Health Care application in staging, and assses the sections that [Analytics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HDGBx-whUrSArDLf8OP_-65lCMPi36h0ihHPA3XqmIk/edit#slide=id.p1) show high drop-off rates as well as general usability of the application.

### Research Questions

The research questions we sought to address: 
- What experiences (personal, social, and medical) bring the user to fill out the application?
  - What other places did the user consider/ turn to for healthcare (outside of the VA)?
- How well does the introduction prepare users to understand what they need in order to apply?
- Within the application form, what section(s) stop users from completing the form?
- Does the task analysis reflect similar drop-off points as the analytics?
- Why do financial sections have the highest drop-off rate?
  - Does the user understand why financial information must be provided?
- What outside factors does the current form overlook? 

## Key Findings

## Details of Findings

### The redesigned "question page" where participants answer if they want to upload documentation overall worked well, participants were much more comfortable moving through it [than in the previous round of testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md)
Because the question now centers around asking to upload legal representative documents or not, it did not create a barrier for those participants who did not have Power of Attorney (POA) documents or POA itself. 



## Additional Insights
* Many Caregivers live with the Veteran and/or use their contact information in place of the Veteran's, in the future it might be nice to consider having a checkbox to select the same address, phone, and email to avoid writing the same thing twice.

* Learn more about who qualifies as a Primary/Secondary Caregiver (additional info component)

    * The same people (relations) are listed for both Primary and Secondary, thus this does not help people understand the difference.

    * The list does not match the dropdown list that the user must use to select the relationship of Caregiver to Veteran.

* One participant expressed concern about the Social Security number showing fully on the Review page as she often uses public computers.
    * "I would close it (review accordion) immediately if I saw my Social Security number and address appear on the screen."

## Recommendations
* Implement upload documentation question into the workflow

* Add additional content/example to help users understand what qualifies as a legal representative document

* Explore more options for the signature page

In the future
* Keep the new language for Primary/Secondary Caregiver, but improve the user experience by rethinking both the structure and copy of the question pages, potentially combining them and adding additional information about what each role entails and what the benefits are for each.
* Consider putting medical facilities question on their own page or clarifying language about what is required or optional.

## Next Steps

* Upload page
  - Implement copy tweaks

* Explore options for the representative signature box
