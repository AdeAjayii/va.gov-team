This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes 

- - - 

## Initial Findings
In general, participants seemed to find the 10-10EZ's length acceptable, but research indicates confusion, that could lead to drop-offs, caused by question wording, IA, and design details, outlined below.

**There is general confusion as to the difference between VA benefits**
- Many participants demonstrated confusion as to the difference between Healthcare, disability, and family benefits. This research showed indications that Veterans (and POAs) view VA benefits all as one and don't necessarily distinguish one from another when filling out an application. This leads to applicants' uncertainty as to which form they have/will fill out, and what benefits will be gained from that application. Additionally, it causes frustration when filling out an application as they feel that it is redundant and that the VA should already have a lot of the information on file, including military service information and financial information.
> _(Upon finishing application)_  "I arrived here [review page] thinking that this was the VA benefits application."
> "I was denied for VA Healthcare so then I applied for VA disability and was automatically enrolled in healthcare."

**Participants feel that obtaining healthcare through the VA should be easier**
- Reiterating from above finding, many participants believe that the VA should automatically be able to populate most of the information that is asked in the application (linking to taxes and military service history). Some participants feel that the amount of detail the questions ask in the application is intended to disqualify them and would like this application to be simpler. Some POAs find the questions about Service history particularly difficult to find the answers to, especially when the Veteran has cognitive/PTSD/TBI- related injuries.
> "I file my taxes online, can't it just pull my tax information like the FAFSA does?
> "Why do I have to fill out the military service history and upload a DD214, doesn't the VA already have this information...from the military?"
> "When there are so many questions it feels like they are trying to discourage people from filling out the form - do all these questions even matter?"


**Participants wish that there was more information about why specific information is requested and would like transparency on how the information will be used to make a decision about their VA Healthcare application**
- Many participants felt uncertain as to why some of the questions were asked, specifically around financial disclosure, spouse and dependent information, military service, and current VA compensation. Some participants indicated that these questions felt invasive, they worried about their privacy, and they didn't understand the relevancy for receiving health care benefits. Additionally, participants felt like spouse and dependent information shouldn't impact their health care application. Many participants said that they would be more likely to complete the application if they knew why the information was being requested and how it could help them get VA health care.
> "We are focused on the end result, do we qualify? so it would help us to understand how this information is used."
> "Why is it asking for my marriage date? It's starting to feel like a truth test."
> "What does my spouse's income have to do with my VA Healthcare? I'm applying for me, not them. This is too nosy, I would say that I am not married." _(participant is married)_


**Participants worry that their answers to some questions could automatically disqualify them from VA Healthcare**
- The majority of participants worried that their answers to some questions could automatically disqualify them from receiving healthcare benefits. Some said that they may even quit the application upon seeing the questions, because they thought they would be disqualified anyway. This concern was mainly around military service history, current VA compensation, and financial disclosure.
>  _On financial disclosure page_ "I wish it was more clear about the income threshhold, I would be worried that I don't qualify."
>  _On current VA benefits page_ Selects: I don't receive any VA pay... "Does this mean I don't qualify?"


**Service history section causes confusion**
- This page leads many participants to believe that they must have one of these qualifying factors or that they will be disqualified from VA Healthcare. The information architecture of this page also causes categorization confusion and participants wonder what the list is and how it will be used. Some participants wonder why there are not more recent events/situations listed.
> _On service history page_ "Since none of these apply to me, I would be worried this would disqualify me." _When asked if it would deter from finishing form_ "It might, yes."
> "What do these have to do with healthcare?"
> "These seem outdated. I'm looking for something having to do with Iraq."
> When asked how they think this information will be used. "Maybe this will be used to determine my treatment plan?"


**The financial disclosure and household information section was the most likely to be stated as the hardest part of the application**
- Many people were just unclear on how to fill out these questions. They weren't always sure where to find this information and they also felt uncertain as to what the questions are asking for. Many also felt trepidation about how the information would be used and its impact on their qualification for healthcare. Additionally the dependent section cause confusion as to what qualifies as a dependent and for those that the dependent is their child, the "When did they become your dependent?" question is confusing.
> "Oh geeze. Oh jesus....Now I need to call my tax man...It should say what box to refer to on my tax form or just let me upload it."  _(In regards to financial disclosure and dependents information)_
> Will my financial information impact the health coverage I receive?"
> "When I filled this out in the past, I had to call my husband, he didn't have the paperwork with him so I had to save the form and finish it at home with the kids running around."
> "What is a dependent defined? My spouse? I also finance my spouse's parents, but they live in the Phillipines, do they count or do I have to go by the IRS definition?"
> In regards to net income: "Does a house count?"
> "The dependent section is so long, I have three kids, can't I just click something so they have the same last name? Also 'when did they become your dependent?' Isn't this the same as their birthdate? And if they don't fall in the 18-24 range, then why is it asking if I paid for school and their income?"


**Medicaid and Medicare related questions don't provide enough details**
- Many participants did not know how to answer these questions (even when reading the more information component). Some wished they could answer, "I don't know," some said they would have to stop and do research. Additionally, one participant faced confusion with the design, and thought that the more information component was the question itself.
> "I wish I could answer 'I don't know' because if I put 'no' then I would think it would be on my record and I would be disqualified from getting it, but I don't know if I am."


**There is uncertainty about how the applicant will be contacted and a desire to be able to specify preferred contact method**
- Since the email and phone number are not required and the application does not ask the applicant to specify a preferred contact method, participants were uncertain by what means they would be contacted. Many participants who volunteered their email and/or phone number had expectations that these would be used to contact them regarding their application status, but felt uncertain since these fields were not required. The majority of participants expressed that they would like to be able to choose their preferred contact method. Participants also expressed an expectation that they would receive an email (if email was provided) that their application had been successfully submitted.
> _After application submission_ Asked what they expected to happen next, "I would like to receive an email rather than mail [like previous experience], but I didn't input an email because it's not required and it didn't say communication could be through this."
> _After application submission_ "I wish they let me choose my preffered contact- I don't know if it will come by phone, email, etc...I expect notification of receipt, when its under review, timeline updates, if they need anything..."


**Opportunities in design**
- In general research shows the need to streamline/simplify the application. Additionally, participants would like more visual confirmation that their information is correct and being received. Multiple participants expressed that they liked having the timeline at the top of the page to give them a proper completion time expectation as they worked through the application, but felt confusion in that multiple pages had the same step numbers and that the timeline bar didn't progress consistently. People appreciate the more information component, but it also can create confusion depending on its placement- sometimes people don't see it, think it is the question, or don't automatically seek it out when they need more information about a question. 
> _On Medicaid page_ In regards to the learn more component: "I would say, yes I want to learn more...Why is it asking me for the start date...this would make me lose confidence in the whole thing."
> "When I click continue and it jumps up to the next page it feels jarring, like I missed something. I would like some confirmation of my input."


**Opportunities in content**
- The big takeway in regards to content is the need to simplify questions and provide details on how the provided information will be used to make a decision about the health care application. Some information is redundant (name, social security number). Some language needs to be rewritten in plain language, providing more details (without adding mental burden) can provide transparency as to why and how the information is used. Some participants find some of the questions unclear especially around financial disclosure questions, including what qualifies as a dependent. Finally, some participants expressed concern about security and privacy, especially around uploading their discharge paperwork and would like more information provided about this, especially on the military service upload discharge papers page.
> "Feels like a lot of government gobbly goop."
> "I would like to know how all this information is used and what security measures are taken. My husband is reallly concerned about security, he wouldn't upload his DD214."
> In regards to previous year's deductables, "It yes you or your spouse. Does it mean and? Does a deductable qualify?"
