This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings
In general, participants found the 10-10EZ's length acceptable, but rather, confusion and potential drop-offs, are caused by question IA, design components, and lack of clarity in the application's questions.


**General confusion as to the difference between VA benefits**
- Many participants demonstrated confusion as to the difference between Healthcare, disability, and family benefits. This research showed indications that Veterans (and POAs) view VA benefits all as one and don't necessarily distinguish one from another when filling out an application. This leads to applicants' uncertainty as to which form they have/will fill out, and what benefits will be gained from that application. Additionally, it causes frustration when filling out an application as they feel that it is redundant and that the VA should already have a lot of this information on file, including military service information and financial information.

**Feel that is should be easier**
- Reiterating from above finding, many participants believe that the VA should automatically be able to populate most of the information that is asked in the application (linking to taxes and military service history). 
- These details could be key words, actions, or test outcomes
> Quote (if relevant)


**Applicants wish that there was more information about why information is requested and transparency on how it will be used to make a decision on their VA Healthcare application**
- Many participants felt uncertain as to why some of the questions were asked, specifically around financial disclosure, spouse and dependent information, military service, and current VA compensation. Some participants indicated that these questions felt invasive, they worried about their privacy, and they didn't understand the relevancy for receiving health care benefits. Additionally, participants felt like spouse and dependent information shouldn't impact their health care application.

**Applicants worry that their answer to some questions could automatically disqualify them from VA Healthcare**
- The majority of participants worried that their answers to some questions could automatically disqualify them from receiving healthcare benefits. Some said that they would even quit the application upon seeing the questions, because they thought they would be disquslified anyway. These were specifically around military service history, current VA compensation, and financial disclosure.

**Service history section causes confusion**
- This page leads many participants to believe that they must have one of these qualifying factors or that they will be disqualified from VA Healthcare. The information architecture of this page also causes categorization confusion and participants wonder what the list is.
> Quote (if relevant)


**Financial disclosure and household information section caused the most confusion**
- Many people were just unclear on how to fill out these questions. They weren't always sure where to find this information and they also felt uncertain as to what the questions are asking for.
> Quote (if relevant)


**Medicaid and Medicare related questions**
- Many participants did not know how to answer these questions (even when reading the more information component). Some wished they could answer, "I don't know." Some said they's have to stop and research. Additionally, one participant faced confusion with the design, and thought that the more information component was the question itself.
> Quote (if relevant)


**Preferred contact**
- Since the email and phone number are not required and the applicaiton does not ask the applicant to specify a preferred contact method, participants were uncertain by what means they would be contacted. Many participants who volunteered their email and/or phone number had expectations that these would be used to contact them regarding their application, but felt uncertain since these fields were not required. The majority of participnats expressed that they would like to be able to choose their contact method. Participants also expressed an expectation that they would receive an email (if email was provided) that their application had been successfully submitted.

**Opportunities in design**
- Multiple participants expressed that they liked having the timeline at top to give them a proper time expectation, but felt confusion in that multiple pages had the same step number and that the timeline bar didn't progress consistently. People appreciate the more information component, but it also can create confusion depending on its placement. Sometimes people don't see it, think it is the question, or don't automatically seek it out when they are confused about a question.

**Opportunities in content**
- Some information is redunant (name, social security number), some language needs to be rewritten in plain language, providing more details (without adding mental burden) can provide transparency
- These details could be key words, actions, or test outcomes
