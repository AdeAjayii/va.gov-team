# [Draft] Research outline: Health care application 10-10EZ, April/May 2021

## Goals:

The goals of research are to:

* Better understand why Veterans start the application, but donâ€™t complete it.

* Gain human understanding behind the sections that the analytics show high drop-off rates.

* Gain insight of workarounds that are used to overcome barriers offline (eg. when a Veteran submits a paper form).

* Update design/content to improve the user experience and improve the conversation rate of qualified health care applicants.

## Research Outline:

1. [Discovery interviews with 4-6 subject-matter experts (SMEs)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10EZ/Research%20April-May%202021/SME%20Discovery%20Research/1:1%20research-plan.md)
