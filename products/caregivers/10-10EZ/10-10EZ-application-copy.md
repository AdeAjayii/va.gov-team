**2. Gather your information**

Here’s what you’ll need to apply:
- **Social Security numbers** for you, your spouse, and your qualified dependents
- **Your military discharge paper**s (DD214 or other separation documents)
- **Insurance cards** for all insurance companies that cover you. This includes any coverage provided through a spouse or significant other. This also includes Medicare, private insurance, or insurance from your employer. 

If you don’t have a service-connected disability, we’ll also ask you for this information:
- **Gross household income** for the year 2020 for you, your spouse, and your dependents. This includes income from a job and any other sources. Gross household income is your income before taxes and any other deductions.
- **Your deductible expenses** for the past year. These include certain health care and education costs. These expenses will lower the amount of money we count as your income.

Why does the VA need this information?  _(more info)_

When you apply for VA health care, we assign you to 1 of 8 priority groups.
We do this for 2 reasons:
- To help Veterans who need care right away sign up quickly. For example, we assign Veterans with service-connected disabilities the highest priority. 
- To make sure we can provide high quality care to all enrolled Veterans. Your priority may affect how much (if anything) you’ll have to pay toward the cost of care.

We base your priority group on these factors:
- Your military service history, **and**
- Your disability rating, **and**
- Your income level, **and**
- Whether or not you qualify for Medicaid, **and**
- Other benefits you may receive (like VA pension benefits)

**Note:** We ask for information about other health care insurance you may have only for billing purposes. Having other health insurance doesn’t affect your eligibility for VA health care.
