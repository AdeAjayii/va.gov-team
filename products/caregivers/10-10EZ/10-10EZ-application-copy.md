Each time the Veteran wants to add a new family caregiver, the Veteran and the new caregiver will need to submit a new application. There can only be 1 Primary and up to 2 Secondary Family Caregivers at any one time.

**Note:** If the Veteran isn’t enrolled in VA health care or is currently on active duty with a medical discharge, they’ll need to fill out an Application for Health _(link)_ Benefits (VA Form 10-10EZ).
