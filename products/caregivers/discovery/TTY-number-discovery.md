# TTY Phone Number Discovery

## Background

This is discovery for issue [#45117](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/10-10-health-apps-5fff0cfd1462b6000e320fc7/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/45117) - Investigate proper inclusion of TTY when referencing VA phone numbers.

From the original issue:

> Currently have incomplete use. Sometimes when we reference phone numbers, we mention TTY; other times, we don't. We should either update all eligible phone numbers with any TTY information that exists; or update all eligible phone numbers to no longer have the TTY information.

## Current EZ / CG experience

## Usage guidance

- The VA design system currently only has TTY associated with the general help desk number.
