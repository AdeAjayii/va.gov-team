## Overview
* We want to increase the confidence with which Veterans select a facility on the 10-10CG, since it's key to getting their application routed appropriately.

Request from CG Team:

>CARMA looking into connection with Lighthouse API for VAMC info (eg name, phone number, address, etc)
>Would go to prod in ~August 2022
>VA.gov Scope: look into changing VA.gov list of VAMC info for Veteran questions on 1010CG from manual CARMA list to the Lighthouse API

## Problems to solve

* Facility names change often
* Veterans may not know the name of the larger VA Medical Facility 
* The layout of the page has been confusing in user research
