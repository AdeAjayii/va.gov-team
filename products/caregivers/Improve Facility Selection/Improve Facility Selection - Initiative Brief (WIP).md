## Overview
* We want to increase the confidence with which Veterans select a facility on the 10-10CG, since it's key to getting their application routed appropriately.

Request from CG Team:

>- Current
>     - Provide VA.gov a limited list of VAMCs for Veterans to select
>          - Filtered to where CSC is and does not allow a Veteran to fully answer the questions
>               - Name of VA medical center or clinic where you receive, or plan to receive, health care services
>               - Name of facility where you last received medical treatment
>     - Worked with Lighthouse team to add “CSC” present toggle in the API
>- PI 7
>     - Connect Lighthouse API to updated internal CARMA VAMC info
>- Needed from VA.gov
>     - Original plan was to have VA.gov connect to Lighthouse as well so they could switch away from the manual list
>     - Open up choices for the Veteran to choose from for those 2 questions
>          - CARMA or MuleSoft would then route the application to the correct VAMC queue in CARMA
>
>CARMA looking into connection with Lighthouse API for VAMC info (eg name, phone number, address, etc)
>- Would go to prod in ~August 2022
>- VA.gov Scope: look into changing VA.gov list of VAMC info for Veteran questions on 1010CG from manual CARMA list to the Lighthouse API
