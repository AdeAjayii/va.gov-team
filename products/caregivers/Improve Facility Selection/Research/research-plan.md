# [DRAFT] Research Plan: 10-10CG facility selection usability/explorative study, 1010 Team, February 2023



## Background

- [Caregivers Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10CG%20Caregiver%20application%20product-outline.md).
-[Initiative Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/Improve%20Facility%20Selection/Improve%20Facility%20Selection%20-%20Initiative%20Brief.md)

## Background
This research is to be conducted on the application for Family Caregiver Benefits (10-10CG) by the 1010 team.

During previous usability studies on this form (Research Findings: [February 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Usability%20Study-Sign%20as%20Representative-%20February%202021/research-findings.md), [April 2021](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Sign-as-Rep-Round2-Usability-April%202021/research%20findings.md)) we have found the VA medical facility selection page caused many users confusion. A few trends in confusion include:
1. Users are confused why the facility they are familiar with isn't listed. (The current dropdown list only includes facilities with a Caregiver support staff)
2. Users are uncertain which facility to specify (Eg. Primary care, therapist, oncologist, most recent, etc.)
3. Users that live on state borders potentially would have to select a different state from where they live in order to find their preferred facility (located in another state).

In addition, this question is asked to aid in routing the application to the appropriate local VA facility where there are Caregiver Support Staff located. 

We have redesigned the facilities question to address the problem and this research is on the usability of this redesign and some additional explorative research interview questions. We are conducting a combination a/b/c test with additional questions to research the clarity and understanding of the purpose of the question. 


### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 


## Research Goals	

The goals of this user research are to:
1. Determine whether or not this facility question is understandable 
2. Determine whether or not this facility question makes it clear for the applicant to know how the information is used
3. Determine whether or not this facility redesign resolves the confusion trends listed above



Understanding of question being asked and HOW / WHY this information will be used. EX: Asking for primary health facility for the purpose of application routing only. 



### Outcome


### Research questions

1. Are users able to navigate through facility selection without difficulty?
2. Do users understand what they are selecting?
3. Do users understand how the postal code was pre-populated?
4. Can users easily change the text input and understand what choices are populated from that search?
5. Do users understand "no facility found" error and can easily work through it?



### Hypothesis
Our hypothesis is that users will be able to navigate through the facility selection relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
- The amount of results shown
- Filtering results by miles away
- Not recognizing the name of the facility they are looking for


## Methodology	

**A/B/C usability and interview questions**

This will be a focused study on only the facility question(s). The goal is to understand the usability impact to variations around question wording, location search and selection, and confirmation messaging.  


A task-based usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract. A remote moderator will begin with introduction questions and prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide).


- Where does the participant think that the pre-populated postal code came from?
- Can they clear the text input field?
- Do they know what to input in the text field?
- Can they successfully filter by distance?
- When the distance is automatically raised (if no results within specified distance), is this clear to the participant?
- Can users successfully navigate past a "no results" error?
- Can users successfully load more facilities if return is greater than 5?


Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototype.



****
We will be testing with a coded form in staging on desktop and mobile. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.

## Recruitment	





### Recruitment approach
We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 8-10 fulfilled remote sessions. Therefore, we request that 15 sessions be scheduled.


### Recruitment criteria
|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
|      15       |          8-10    |6       |  2          |   7      |               | 



**Primary criteria (must-haves)**


**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**


--

**Must have for participants**

All participants must:

- At least 5 Veterans
- At least 3 POAs
- At least 5 people who plan to use their computer for the session
- At least 5 people who plan to use their smartphone for the session
- At least 1 person who uses a screen reader
- Have access to a laptop/desktop or smartphone/tablet and be willing to complete the test on said laptop/desktop/smartphone/tablet
- Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom


**Participant pool should strive for the following breakdown**

- Age: 
     - over age 55: 50%

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 


### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 45 minutes
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes
* Maximum Sessions per day: 4
