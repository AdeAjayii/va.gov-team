## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about [description of your project].

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I want to be sure before we get going. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers. 
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)
   - Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 



## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - X minutes

Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few warm-up questions.


**I'm going to send you a link in the chat.**
_I actually do this as I’m explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end I’m looking at their screen, then I move onto recording._
_TBD link_
**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?





## First Task: [TASK NAME] - X minutes

For this study we are going to look at 3 different options and want your feedback on what option is the easiet for you to answer with confidence.  


## Option A - 7 minutes

- You are completing the application for caregiver benefits and after you answer general background questions on the Veteran you arrive at this page. Please explain your understanding of what is being asked.




**For Veterans:**

Let's say you heard about a way you and your caregiver could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at https://staging.va.gov/family-member-benefits/apply-for-caregiver-assistance-form-10-10cg/introduction. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits. Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply.

**For Caregivers:**

Let's say you heard about a way you could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at https://staging.va.gov/family-member-benefits/apply-for-caregiver-assistance-form-10-10cg/introduction. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits. Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply.

**All**

If the participant immediately moves to click on "start your application..." button, I will ask them if they usually read this intro page, even if no, continue with the following questions.

- Please read the entire page and let me know if any questions come to mind.
- After participant reads and initial questions are noted:
  - What do you think of the listed requirements? 
  - Is there anything that you would not have on-hand or would need to prepare before starting this application?
  - Do you have any additional thoughts or questions? 

- Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this page, please procede as if you were going to apply.

In general, we want to sit back and watch them, but if they hesitate you can say “I noticed you hesitate here, what are you thinking?”

If they need a SSN, use 548-79-5555

Upon arrival to the facility selection page:

- First just watch the interaction of the participant on this page
     - Remind participants to think out loud.
     - Any fields trip them up?
     - Anything particularly confusing for them?
- Once user interacts with the facility selection for awhile, makes selection, and is ready to move on to the next page, ask them to pause.
     - Were you able to find the facility you were looking for?
     - Did you have any confusion which one to choose?
     - Is there any other information you would like to better help you make your selection?
     - Where do you think the prefilled zip code came from?
- Complete the following tasks (if not already completed on their own):
     - Pretend you were about to move to Dallas, Texas (or somewhere other than their current location). So you want to look what VA facilities are there. What would you do? (observe how they clear the input field)
     - What would you do if you don't see the facility you are looking for (or some other way to prompt the user to interact with the "show more" button.
     - Now pretend you were moving to Homer, Alaska (or somewhere that doesn't have a VA facility within 50 miles). (observe the "magic" loader to extended distance).  
     - You had selected that you would like to see results within a 50 mile distance, can you talk about what the results are showing? Note any surprises, confusion.
     - Talk through general thoughts, feelings about this page.
- Great! Go ahead and continue the application (note any confusion, especially around the Primary/Secondary questions.)
- _(Time permitting)_ Once arrive at file upload page, if participant says "no" prompt them to say yes and continue to the file upload page.
      - I'd like to test the error on this page if you upload a file that the system cannot accept _(TBD- provide them with a file too large)_ (note any interaction, hiccups, confusion, questions)

Participant doesn't need to finish the rest of the form.



## Post task questions - 5 minutes

Wonderful! I have a few questions about what you just saw in the prototype.

**Overall** 

- What did you think of the overall experience?
- Was there anything that stood out to you? Then prompt positives/ negatives / confusing
- Can you tell me about this experience in your own words, as if I was another Veteran/Caregiver interested in applying for the Caregiver program.
- Any other thoughts or questions for me before we conclude?
 
## Thank you and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members.
Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
