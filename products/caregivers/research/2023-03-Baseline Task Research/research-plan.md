# Research Plan for [1010 Team, Caregiver Application (10-10CG) Baseline Study, March 2023]

## Background
This research is to be conducted on the application for Family Caregiver Benefits (10-10CG) by the 1010 team. This is an existing application and the goal of this study is to get a baseline understanding of the overall usability of the key tasks. 


- [Caregivers Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/10-10CG%20Caregiver%20application%20product-outline.md)

- [Past research insights](https://www.sketch.com/s/5a676881-7aa8-4054-9b6e-34d86ced43d8/a/eK1L73z)


### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) this research supports are:

Increase
- Completion rate of online transactions
- Usage of digital, self-service tools

Decrease
- Time to successful complete and submit online transactions


### Veteran Journey
This product fits into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf):

- Taking care of myself
- Aging

A moment that matters in the journey is during the aging phase when Veterans increasingly seeking alternatives to institutional based care and instead wish to stay independent for longer, remaining in their homes and communities. 



## Research Goals	

- Gain an understanding of the most common pain points encoutered 
- Discover what is easy or difficult to complete on the form and why
- Obtain a qualitative baseline to understand the form overall, how this study compares to past research findings and future design iterations  



### Outcome
This research will provide a qualitative baseline of the overall usability of this application by both Veterans and Caregivers. We will use the findings from this study combined with key insights from previous studies to guide and compare future design iterations. 

- Example: Improve Facility Selection Project Brief


### Research questions


**Gain an understanding of the most common pain points encoutered** 
- What sections of the form cause the participant the most pause or confusion?





### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Method	
- Moderated usability testing 

### Location
Remote via Zoom


### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.


### Recruitment approach
Our intended audience for this research is a mix of Veterans, Caregivers, and family members. 

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 


|Total requested|Completed sessions|Veterans|Family Member|Caregivers|Service Members|
|:-------------:|:----------------:|:------:|:-----------:|:--------:|:-------------:|
|               |                  |        |             |          |               | 





**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)



**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
We will be testing the existing approved application that is in staging mirroring production. 

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 


### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: **March ## - ##, 2023**


### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)



### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
