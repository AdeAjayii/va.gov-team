## December 2, 2022 CG Stakeholder Touchbase

### Notes

- **Facilities questions**
     - How can we ask this question differently to get the information needed?
          - The information needed is the facility with Caregiver Support for application processing and supporting the Caregiver.
          - Today, we provide the list of Caregiver support facilities to select from, but the question asks about the Veteran’s preferred facility, so it could be misleading
Why should we continue down the path of asking for the Veteran’s preferred facility, but do not actually need that information?
The PDF generated will show the Caregiver support facility, which could cause more confusion
Can we simply rephrase the question, asking for the applicants to select
The Caregiver support facility of their choice?
The closest one to their home or Veteran’s preferred facility?
Can we ask them to select the Veteran’s preferred facility and display the associated Caregiver support facility so that they know what information is being captured?
Select Veterans Preferred Facility
[display CG facility] Here is the Caregiver support facility where a Caregiver Support Coordinator will review this application
- Confused on the state where the pref facility is located, especially when they are on the border
- Salesforce API expose to us and maybe use it for facility search by zip code
- FUTURE: Consider CARMA as source, integrated with LH API
- City field as optional?
- Facilities with type ahead?


Review page condesed IDEA from BECCA
- Uptick in mistakes
- Looking for ways to reduce this before submitting
- Expand Review page, instead of showing condensed
- Required fields must be valid and correct
- Looking at doing cheatsheets & video on how to complete the form accurately
- Heather: Reply with findings 

Eligibility Widget
- Click into Eligibility widget first before starting (like a checklist or something?)?
- Matt Brown: Not a fan of this
- Patrick: Not a technical challenge, but not a fan of this either



- **Duplicate info entered on applications**
     - Application is considered duplicate info, even if there is new information too
     - Scenario:
          - Veteran wants to add new 2nd
          - Applies and lists primary again along with new 2nd
          - Application goes thru duplicate process
          - Veteran has to apply again without primary listed
     - Can we call MPI for approved caregiver?
          - Don't want to block if it is approved, but can we check for matching info in same position?
     - **Opportunity** We could add some info to the form about this

- **Additional questions are pending CG team review and response:**
     - Do we know the ratio or volume or applications that are approved vs declined?  
          - We don't have visibility into this metric and wondered what the most common reasons for rejection, if there is a significant volume
          - Our question to ourselves would be Is there anything we can change that could help reduce the volume of rejected applications?
     - **Pending CG Team review**

     - We are looking for topic trends regarding Veterans or Caregivers calling in that may pertain to the application process or information. 
          - One trend we are seeing from the survey data is that some people are confused, trying to apply to get a Caregiver assigned to them by VA, or trying to apply for a Caregiver job (as opposed to a Caregiver for a specific Veteran).
          - Are there other trends like this that we should consider when looking at improvements and content updates?
     - **Pending CG Team review**

     - Is there a way to obtain the volume of rerouted applications, due to Veterans’ preferred facility selections?
          - We are considering this as an important metric, once we can deploy the updated Facility Selection page update.
     - **Pending CG Team review**
