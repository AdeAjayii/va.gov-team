## Jul 22, 2022 CG Stakeholder Touchbase

### Notes

- Prod issue
     - Explanation of issue CD-1130430
          - Applicant filling out with Primary CG, however data is coming in as Secondary CG.  
          - Becca requested more info from Ops team from last 30 days
     - Date & Time provided for one example (**6/2/2022 12:04PM EST**)
     - Health Apps team requesting if CARMA team/Ramesh can provide request body without PII
          - Health Apps team can review and set up a catch if it happens again
     - CARMA team/Ramesh will compare raw data with PDF generated
          - So far, per email from Ramesh, Data & PDF show secondary CG only
          - Requesting more examples

- Catastrophic Failure SOP
     - Health Apps team requesting average MuleSoft downtimes since implementation
     - Health Apps team provided link to SOP in deck with metrics

- ICN Implementation
     - This is feasible and Lihan is working on this now!

- Vets-api retries
     - Health Apps team is targeting end of August to complete
     - This includes the single async call

- Caregiver Same Address checkbox released to 100% on Thursday!

- MPI Validation errors
     - Today, when the Veteran cannot be validated in MPI, the applicant receives an error message
     - The application is not submitted and the applicant must print and mail it.
     - This scenario has potential for us to solve without the print & mail process
          - VA.gov sends the application,  potentially append an indicator “Not validated” (for example)
               - Allowing for those applications to have extra attention
     - **CG team response**: Concerns raised about sending invalid applications, creating additional burden on support teams.
          - Health Apps team has a ticket in the backlog to dive into any details on whether the MPI errors are seen for actual Veterans or erroneous entries.
