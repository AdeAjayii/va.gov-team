## 10/31/2022 Notes from mtg with Lori on Check-in Team re: Language translations experience

### Notes:
- Communications
     - Randi H is main contact in between
     - Did meet with the translators once to get a better understanding of how they work
     - Start with JSON file for each language
          - Key value pairs
     - There were some back & forth, this is round 3
     - PM keeps track of changes needed and sends a bulk request of updates every few months or so (quarterly)
     - Some keys (Key value pairs) may not be used now (future)
     - Sent Additional content to translate such as time zones and text messages
     - Sent text/content originally, didnt have screenshots
     - Send screenshots, the translators will want access to site to see it for them selves (Check-in was very hard to do)
          - Created workflow screenshots
          - Take what they sent, assigned numbers and put those numbers on the screenshots
          - Seeing it in context, that is what helps translators see whether it makes sense
     - Sent both spanish and english so they can check against each other 
          - Helps with QA
          - May go back and forth during QA for tweaking and questions

- Was this application multilingual to start with or did that come later?
     - It came later, when they were releasing to VISNs
     - Stakeholders were prepping for releasing to FL and PR, and brought up idea to get translations
     - Danielle still working thru the process to see the best way to handle, to formalize
     - Tested with bi-lingual Veterans for context as well
     - There is lag time when sending to State Dept translators,  and getting it back
     - A Disclaimer was put at the top of Check-in application "Some content may be in English" when pending updates
     - Veterans stated it is disconcerting to have mixed languages
     - Stakeholders thought it would be more helpful than not having it there. 

- Specific pages vs language toggle?
     - The way this was implemented, they didnt have to do diff pages
     - Using locale settings
     - It decides which JSON file to use, doesnt have to worry about the routing
     - Accessibility for screenreaders, some aria-labels, you have to think about those as translated as well


- Everything we request to be translated is tracked in an application
     - Have to let them know if something is being used or not

- Language Toggle
     - Not expandable/scalable with more languages
     - Links that point to pages that are only in english should have that in parentheses (en ingles) 
     - Can toggle on each page of the application
     - Also checks browser settings and picks up if you are in the other language
     - Focus was on US Territory languages
     - Consider what to do with more than 3 languages (Toggle is not scalable as-is)
     - Caregivers mostly use English
     - Very few people are using this toggle right now
          - 1-2 per week
     - PM created Program to evaluate english and spanish to see what is different and needs updating
    
- Timeline from start to delivery during initial translation?
     - Took about 3 months to get from start to finish brand new
     - Doesnt take long to do updates now
     - Tagalog took a long time
          - Randi did mention that there was only 1 Tagalog translator
