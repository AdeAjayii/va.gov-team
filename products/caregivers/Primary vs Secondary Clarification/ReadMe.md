# Primary vs Secondary Clarification - Initiative Brief
#### Overview

<details>
 
 *There is roughly a 1:many relationship between products and initiatives, or our attempts to improve a product/achieve Veteran outcomes. The same goes for product outlines and initiative briefs. This template can be used as product documentation for the Collaboration Cycle, especially when iterating an existing product. In addition, the Brief is an important communication tool within a team and between the team and Crew Chief/PO/other teams.*

## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?

User story: As a Veteran and Caregiver/s applying for PCAFC, I want to be clear about the difference between a Primary and Secondary Caregiver. I want to know if there are different requirements and what benefits each one receives in order to apply for the correct one.

Unrelated usability research studies have shown that users are unclear the difference between a Primary and Secondary Caregiver. A big reason for this is that the selection to apply for each of these is separated in the flow. Another reason is that people don't know what the difference between Primary and Secondary is- if there are different requirements (there aren't) and what benefits are different.

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks. Inspired by [SVPG's Four Big Risks](https://www.svpg.com/four-big-risks/).*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - .
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - .
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Examples:
    - Upstream/Downstream API/Data availability and reliability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: 
    - VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements
