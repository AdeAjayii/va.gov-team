- Notes from Design story
>Note from the CG program team:
>
>- They have been receiving a higher than usual amount of Secondary CG applications. These are from older Veterans.
>- They feel there is a lack of understanding what a secondary CG is - that is comes with heavy commitments and requirements similar to the primary. Such as check-ins, >etc.
>- Lack of understanding of the difference of Primary and Secondary- responsibilities, benefits, etc.
>- Secondary is not just anyone who helps out (such as underage child, etc.)
>- It is unclear whether when applying for secondary, the applicant needs to reenter primary CG information
>- Applicants are unclear if they HAVE to enter both Primary and Secondary (eg. They see Secondary so they enter one- sometimes same info as Primary)



#### Overview

 
---

## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* What is the problem and who is affected? And, what evidence do we have of the problem?
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
* How does this initiative help further OCTO-DE's mission and goals?

User story: As a Veteran and Caregiver/s applying for PCAFC, I want to be clear about the difference between a Primary and Secondary Caregiver. I want to know if there are different requirements and what benefits each one receives in order to apply for the correct one.

Unrelated usability research studies have shown that users are unclear the difference between a Primary and Secondary Caregiver. A big reason for this is that the selection to apply for each of these is separated in the flow. Another reason is that people don't know what the difference between Primary and Secondary is- if there are different requirements (there aren't) and what benefits are different.

## Outcome Summary

* Provide clarity between Primary and Secondary Caregiver roles and benefits, reducing duplicate and abandoned applications.

## Desired User Outcomes
* Understanding of the Primary and Secondary Caregiver roles and benefits
* Confidence in completing the form accurately
* Trusting that VA processes will provide expected results

## Undesired User Outcomes
* Uncertainty of the difference between Primary and Secondary Caregiver roles and benefits
* Frustration and/or confusion causing application abandonment
* Distrust in VA and its processes

## Desired Business Outcomes
* Reduced duplicate applications
* Reduced application abandonment
* Increased trust and satisfaction

## Undesired Business Outcomes
* no change or increase in duplicate applications
* no change or increased application abandonment
* Distrust in VA and its processes

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - There is a Risk that applicants will still have difficulty determining the difference between the Primary and Secondary Caregiver roles and benefits
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - There is a risk that, due to lack of clarity, applicants may not know how to complete the application accurately
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - There is a low risk of technical issues that would be due to this change.  The usual overall VA>gov risks are still applicable, which are focused on service reliability and performance.
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - The risk/constraint is that the stakeholders will not have favorable feedback on the changes
