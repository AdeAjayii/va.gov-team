# [DRAFT] Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, 10-10CG facility selection redesign usability testing, August 2021

## Background
This research is to be conducted on the Health Care Application (10-10EZ) by the Caregivers team.

During various usability studies on this form we have found the facility selection page to cause many users confusion. A few trends in confusion include:
1. Users don't know why the facility they are familiar with isn't listed. (The current dropdown list only includes facilities with a Caregiver support staff)
2. Users are uncertain which facility to specify (Eg. Primary care, therapist, oncologist, most recent, etc.)
3. Users that live on state borders potentially would have to select a different state from where they live in order to find their preferred facility (located in another state).

## Goals	

The goals of this user research are to:
1. Determine whether or not this facility redesign is usable 
2. Determine whether or not this facility redesign is accessible
3. Determine whether or not this facility redesign resolves the confusion trends listed above.

**Research questions**

1. Are users able to navigate through facility selection without difficulty?
2. Do users understand what they are selecting?
3. Do users understand how the postal code was pre-populated?
4. Can users easily change the text input and understand what choices are populated from that search?
5. Do users understand "no facility found" error and can easily work through it?


**Hypotheses**

Our hypothesis is that users will be able to navigate through the facility relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
- The amount of results shown
- Filtering results by miles away
- Not recognizing the name of the facility they are looking for


## Method	
**Task analysis**

A task-based usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract. A remote moderator will begin with introduction questions and prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide). Because the facility selection appears near the beginning of the flow, we will have the participant start at the beginning of the application, for context, and then conduct complete specific tasks on the facility selection page, paying special attention to:
- Where does the participant think that the pre-populated postal code came from?
- Can they clear the text input field?
- Do they know what to input in the text field?
- Can they successfully filter by distance?
- When the distance is automatically raised (if no results within specified distance), is this clear to the participant?
- Can users successfully navigate past a "no results" error?
- Can users successfully load more facilities if return is greater than 5?

Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototype.

We will be testing with a coded form in staging on desktop and mobile. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.



## Participants and Recruitment	
We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 8-10 fulfilled remote sessions. Therefore, we request that 15 sessions be scheduled.

**Must have for participants**

All participants must:

- Be a Veteran or POA of a Veteran (minimum 3 POA, maximum 5 POA)
- Have access to a laptop/desktop or smartphone/tablet and be willing to complete the test on said laptop/desktop/smartphone/tablet
- Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom


**Participant pool should strive for the following breakdown**

- Age: 50% over age 55, 25% age 18-30, 25% age 31-50 
- Device: 50% smartphone/tablet, 50% laptop/desktop


**Participant pool should in diverse in**
- Branch of service
- Gender (30% or more women)
- Disability rating of 50% or higher representative of applicant demographics
- Race
- Geography
- Density (rural)
