## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jonathan and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about federal benefits that are provided to family members or caregivers of disabled veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention::

- This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.


**Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** 

 - If yes: 
 
**Once I start recording, I will ask again to confirm that you're ok with me recording this session so that it's captured in the recording.** 

###### Start recording to the Cloud

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?"

## Warm-up Questions 

- Can you tell me briefly about your service history?

Thanks for sharing that. 

## Counseling services 

For the purpose of this session, we'll be mostly focused on mental health care services offered at the VA. 
  
  - Are you familiar with mental health or counseling services that the VA provides?

If yes:
  - can you tell me, briefly, about the services that you are familiar with?
  - have you participated in any of these services?
  - how was that experience?
  
## Searching for counseling online

We're going to switch gears and look at a few websites. So that I can follow along with you, would it be OK if you shared your screen with me? 

We're going to start with a blank page in your web browser.
 
I'm going to give you a scenario to consider. Imagine you have a Veteran friend who's been going through a rough time. You think this person could benefit from some mental health care or counseling. You're not exactly sure what's available but you wanted to help out by doing a little digging for them on the internet. 

 - Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on the internet?
 
 (If they need more direction: What might be some common issues that you think might benefit from counseling?)
 
 - Can you try that search for me?
 - What words or phrases would you search for to get you to some answers?

## Searching for counseling on VA.gov

Now let's imagine that you want to see what you can find on VA.gov. You'd like to know where your friend can go to get mental health care or counseling.

 - Can you talk me through how you might go about finding information like this on VA.gov?
 - Can you try that search for me?
 - What words or phrases would you search for to get you to some answers?
 

## Prototype

For the last part of this session, we're going to switch gears again and look at a different webpage together. I'm going to share a link with you to click on. It's going to look like a real web page but its actually just a fake prototype of a website. 

[Share link to prototype](http://)

With the same scenario in mind, helping a friend, except this time I'd like for you to imagine that you did a search and you landed on this page. I'm going to give you a minute to look it over and feel free to think out loud any thoughts that come to mind.

 - What can you tell me about this place?
 - What kind of care or services do you think you get here?
 - What are the most important services offered here?
 - Is there any additional information that you think should be added about each service?
 - What would you be able to tell your friend about individual counseling?
 - What would you be able to tell your friend about group counseling services offered here?
 - What do you think is the relationship between the different locations listed on this page?
 - Is there any other information that you don't see that you think would be helpful or necessary before visiting?
 - What would make this website better?


## Post-Task Interview

Those are all the questions that I had for you today. 

- Do you have any questions for me?


## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
