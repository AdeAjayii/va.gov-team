## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jonathan and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about federal benefits that are provided to family members or caregivers of disabled veterans.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention::

- This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- We also want let you know that you will not actually be applying to the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers or for any VA benefits. Again, this is just to get feedback to improve these tools.
- Please talk aloud as you're looking through things. . For example say "now I'd click on this.. what's this?" this helps me understand what's going through your head while using the tool.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
- Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- If yes: 
- Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

**Start recording to the Cloud**

- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?"

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

- Can you tell me a little about yourself? 
- Can you tell me a little about yourself? Are you a Veteran with a caregiver? Or caregiver with a Veteran? 

**For Caregivers:**

- How long have you been a caregiver? 
- Do you currently live with the Veteran? 
- Are you currently receiving benefits from the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers? 
   
**For Veterans:**

How many caregivers do you have?
Do you currently live with any of your caregivers?
Does your caregiver receive benefits from the VA?


## First Task: [Applying for benefits] - 15 minutes

Moderator sends Drupal content page link [The Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers](https://staging.va.gov/family-member-benefits/comprehensive-assistance-for-family-caregivers/) to participant and asks them to share their screen (note moderator should have backup open on their own computer to share in case veteran can't figure out sharing)

Ok, given the information above, imagine that you’re applying for benefits for you (or your caregivers) through the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. Starting here (start on the Drupal content page), walk me through how you would do this.

**Things to watch for:**
- In general we want to sit back and watch them, but if they hesitate you can say “I noticed you hesitate here, what are you thinking?”
- Any hiccups? Do they know all the information?
- Any fields trip them up?
- Anything particularly confusing for them?
- Make sure to dig in when there's any hesitation into what they are thinking
- Any confusion with the content we use when asking if they are applying with a Primary Family Caregiver?  
- Any confusion with the steps following the Primary Family Caregiver question?  

  
## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Great. A few last questions:

- What do you think was the hardest part of that process?
- What worked well?
- Any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing 

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
