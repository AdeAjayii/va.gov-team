# Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Primary Caregiver/Secondary flow for the 10-10CG form, December 2020

## Background

This study is being conducted by the VSA Caregiver team.	

The Caregiver team launched the digitized 10-10CG form October 1, 2020. The team is adding the functionality that allows Veterans and caregivers to apply to the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers with either a Primary Family Caregiver, Secondary Family Caregiver(s), or both a Primary and Secondary Family Caregiver(s). 

The designs have been created and coded to address this requirement. A usability test with Veterans and caregivers is needed to determine if these changes are understandable and the form is easy to use. 

## Goals

The goals of this usability study are to: 

- Determine whether or not the updated designs of the 10-10CG form are usable and easy to navigate for Veterans and caregivers.

- Specifically, whether or not users understand the Primary Family Caregiver and/or Secondary Family Caregiver flows


### Research questions


The research questions we want to address are: 

- Are users able to easily navigate through the form with the addition of the Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregiver flow? 

- Will users understand the wording we use when asking if they are applying with a Primary Family Caregiver?  

- Will the addition of the question about adding a Primary Family Caregiver confuse individuals in any way when it comes to the steps afterwards?


Our hypothesis: 

- Users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:

- The addition of the Primary Family Caregiver question 

- Knowing if a Vertan or caregiver should “add” a Primary Family Caregiver vs Secondary Family Caregiver
