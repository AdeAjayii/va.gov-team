# Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Primary Caregiver/Secondary flow for the 10-10CG form, December 2020

## Background

This study is being conducted by the VSA Caregiver team.	

The Caregiver team launched the digitized 10-10CG form October 1, 2020. The team is adding the functionality that allows Veterans and caregivers to apply to the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers with either a Primary Family Caregiver, Secondary Family Caregiver(s), or both a Primary and Secondary Family Caregiver(s). 

The designs have been created and coded to address this requirement. A usability test with Veterans and caregivers is needed to determine if these changes are understandable and the form is easy to use. 

## Goals

The goals of this usability study are to: 

- Determine whether or not the updated designs of the 10-10CG form are usable and easy to navigate for Veterans and caregivers.

- Specifically, whether or not users understand the Primary Family Caregiver and/or Secondary Family Caregiver flows


### Research questions


The research questions we want to address are: 

- Are users able to easily navigate through the form with the addition of the Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregiver flow? 

- Will users understand the wording we use when asking if they are applying with a Primary Family Caregiver?  

- Will the addition of the question about adding a Primary Family Caregiver confuse individuals in any way when it comes to the steps afterwards?


Our hypothesis: 

- Users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:

- The addition of the Primary Family Caregiver question 

- Knowing if a Vertan or caregiver should “add” a Primary Family Caregiver vs Secondary Family Caregiver 

## Method

A task-based usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom. A remote moderator will begin with introduction questions and prompt users with guiding questions (from the conversation guide). Participants will be encouraged to talk through their exploration of the prototype. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.  

We will be testing with a coded form in staging. 

- We will ask Veterans to navigate to https://staging.va.gov/family-member-benefits/comprehensive-assistance-for-family-caregivers/ (a link provided in the Zoom chat) and have participants share their screen with us via Zoom.


- Use case 1: Someone to navigate through the form that’s just applying with a primary caregiver. 

- Use case 2: Someone that’s applying with a primary and a secondary caregiver

- Use case 3: Someone that’s applying  with only a secondary caregiver



## Participants and Recruitment

- We will utilize the Perigean contract for **recruiting and notetaking**.
- We'd like to schedule 16 participants to reach our goal of observing **7-9 participants**. 

### Primary participant criteria:
