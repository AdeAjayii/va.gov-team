## Research Goals 

The goals of this usability study are to:

Determine whether or not the updated designs of the 10-10CG form are usable, understandable, and easy navigate for Veterans and caregivers.

## Research Methodology 

A task-based remote, moderated usability study was conducted via GoToMeeting between December 16 - December 18, 2020. A moderator began with introduction questions and prompted users with questions (from the conversation guide). Participants were encouraged to talk through their exploration of the 10-10CG. Remote observers and note takers were also in attendance.
