# Conversation Guide for Caregiver Research Study

## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute*

*In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked*

*Check your [screensharing setup]*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- Set-up participant specific Mural board (or ranking tool)
- Open [10-10CG form](https://staging.va.gov/caregivers/introduction) in a new tab 
- Have [10-10CG prototype](https://staging.va.gov/caregivers/introduction) available in another tab
- Be prepared to screen share in case of technical difficulties 

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Jonathan and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about federal benefits that are provided to family members or caregivers of disabled veterans. 

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **You'll be interacting with prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Please talk aloud as you're looking through things.** . For example say "now I'd click on this.. what's this?" this helps me understand what's going through your head while using the tool. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

**Start recording.**

- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

Before we start the activities I mentioned, I'd like to ask a few questions about yourself. 

- Can you tell me a little about yourself? (If stuck, ask about location, occupation, etc.)

- For Caregivers:

   - Are you currently receiving benefits from the VA’s Program for Family Caregivers? 
   - Are there any other family members / caregivers of the veteran?
   - Do you currently live with your veteran?
   - Do you receive any other benefits from the VA?

- For Veterans:

  - Do you currently have caregivers? Are they currently receiving benefits from the VA’s Program for Family Caregivers? 
  - How many caregivers do you have?
  - Do you currently live with any of your caregivers?
  - Does your caregiver receive benefits from the VA?
  
 Great! Thanks for sharing all of that with me. I'm going to share my screen.


## First Task: [Determining preferred features] - 10 minutes

Feels like there are two different questions here (not sure which one we want to answer - I am thinking the second bullet)

- Are we missing any features? 
- How does a user priortize future features? (If so, what are these features? login, address validation(?), attaching PoA, a portal to check status) 


### Things to watch for:

- How confident is the participant when listing the items they'd want to see?
- How does participant respond to "why" each item is important?
- What elaboration did the participant give (if any) on what information they expect to see in a particular item?
- Which feature is the participant most confident they'd be interested in?
- Do any items cause the participant to hesitate?

## Second Task: [First impressions / thoughts] - 5 minutes
 
- Now you've found the location and landed on this page. (moderator chats link to participant, makes sure still is sharing screen) What are your first impressions? Are you / your caregiver eligible to recieve these benefits?  How do you know?  Which parts were most useful on this page?

## Third Task: [Filling out the form] - 10 minutes

- Now let's say you/your caregiver is eligible and you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits. Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply 

### Things to watch for:

- Any hiccups? Do they know all the information?
- Any fields trip them up?
- Anything particularly confusing for them?
- Make sure to dig in when there's any hesitation into what they are thinking
- If anyone has / is a secondary caregiver, make sure they notice and complete that section

## Third Task: [understanding next steps] - 5 minutes

- Now that you submitted the form, what do you think are the next steps in this process? 

## Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes

Great. A few last questions:
- What do you think was the hardest part of that process?
- What worked well?
- I'm going to quickly show you the paper form (moderator shares screen with paper form).  
   - (if they have benefits) Do you remember if you filled out this form? If so, how did you do it? Together with the caregiver/veteran?  
- Based on going through this flow, would you prefer to fill out this form online or on this paper form? Why? How would this be different than filling out the paper form?
   - Would you fill out the paper form with your veteran/caregiver? what about the online form?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research sesson? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
