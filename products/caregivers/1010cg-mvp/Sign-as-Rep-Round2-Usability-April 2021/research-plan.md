# Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Representative and Primary Caregiver/Secondary for the 10-10CG form, April 2021

## Background

This study is being conducted by the VSA Caregiver team.	

The Caregiver team launched the digitized 10-10CG form October 1, 2020. Currently, the team is adding functionality that allows a Veteran’s legal representative to be identified and documentation (e.g. power of attorney) to be optionally uploaded. Designs have also been updated to surface information around Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregivers.
 
Designs have been created to support the additional functionality of identifying a legal representative. The team hopes to test the understandability, usability, and ease of use of the representative workflow options and if the suggested changes improve the understanding of Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregivers.

## Goals

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Validate the usability of the updated representative workflow.
- Test the usability of the "upload a document" content and understand what types of documents the user would upload.
- Determine if the cognitive understanding of Primary Family Caregiver versus Secondary Family Caregivers is improved.

### Research questions

The research questions we want to address are: 

- Are users confused by any particular aspect of the representative workflow?
- Does the current representative workflow stop users from completing the form?
- Do the changes to the Primary Family Caregiver versus Secondary Family Caregivers display improve or hinder understanding?
- What types of documents does the user plan to upload?


Our hypothesis: 
- Users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
  - The three answer Yes/Yes/No radio options may be confusing to folks
  - People might still not be sure what document to upload


## Methodology 

A task-based usability study will be conducted in staging, remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract.
