# Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Representative and Primary Caregiver/Secondary for the 10-10CG form, April 2021

## Background

This study is being conducted by the VSA Caregiver team.	

The Caregiver team launched the digitized 10-10CG form October 1, 2020. Currently, the team is adding functionality that allows a Veteran’s legal representative to be identified and documentation (e.g. power of attorney) to be optionally uploaded. Designs have also been updated to surface information around Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregivers.
 
Designs have been created to support the additional functionality of identifying a legal representative. The team hopes to test the understandability, usability, and ease of use of the representative workflow options and if the suggested changes improve the understanding of Primary Family Caregiver and Secondary Family Caregivers.

## Goals

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Validate the usability of the updated representative workflow before publication.
- Test the usability of the "upload a document" content (not the actual update funtionality) and understand what types of documents the user would upload.
- Determine if the cognitive understanding of Primary Family Caregiver versus Secondary Family Caregivers is improved.

### Research questions

The research questions we want to address are: 

- Are users confused by any particular aspect of the representative workflow?
- Does the current representative workflow stop users from completing the form?
- Do the changes to the Primary Family Caregiver versus Secondary Family Caregivers display improve or hinder understanding?
- What types of documents does the user plan to upload?


Our hypothesis: 

- Users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but may have issues with the following:
  - the terminology/content might be confusing within the representative workflow
  - the representative workflow might stop users (especially caregivers who are not legal representatives) from completing the form
  - Knowing if a Veteran or caregiver should select the Primary Family Caregiver or Secondary Family Caregiver workflow 
  - Being prepared with the documents/ knowing what documents to upload if they choose this option

## Methodology 

A task-based comparison/usability study will be conducted remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract. This method will allow the team to share high-fidelity wireframe prototypes (desktop only) to answer our research questions and confirm/deny our hypothesis.


## Participants and Recruitment

We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 13 fulfilled sessions.  

We are looking for 13 participants, a mix of Veterans and caregivers.

**Must have for participants**

All participants must be yes to one of the following questions:

- Are you a caregiver to a Veteran?  (must recruit at least 6)

or

- Are you a Veteran who has a caregiver? (must recruit at least 2)

Answer must be yes for 5 participants: 

- Are you a Veteran’s legal representative? 
  - If confused, provide this explanation: A representative is a person who, under applicable law, has authority to act on behalf of the Veteran or who is legally vested with the responsibility or care of the Veteran. 

**Good to have for participants**
