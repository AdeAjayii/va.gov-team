# Conversation Guide: VSA Caregiver, Representative and Primary Caregiver/Secondary for the 10-10CG form, January 2022

## Moderator Logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._
- _Before the session, send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel)._
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Audio section, tap the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure they are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 10 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Dené and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to review a prototype about VA benefits that are provided to Caregivers of Veterans.

- This entire session should take about 45 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- You'll be interacting with a demo tool. This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- Please remember that this is not a test. We want to better understand your experiences, and there are no right or wrong answers.
- Don't feel like you are on a scavenger hunt for bugs. 
- Please talk aloud as you're looking through things. For example, say "now I'd click on this, because I'd expect it to do this..." This helps me understand what's going through your head while using the tool.
- To protect your privacy, we are not going to use your real Social Security Number today. Feel free to make-up a name, birthday, SSN...I can always provide that information if you want
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.

**Talk them through Zoom screen sharing and chat features.**


**I'm going to send you a link in the chat.**
_ I actually do this as I’m explaining to them where to find “Chat” and “Share,” so by the end I’m looking at their screen, then I move onto recording._

**Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:**

- Ok, it seems like we're having some trouble getting the prototype up on your screen. I'm really excited for you to participate though, so what we're going to do today is have me share my screen, and then I'm going to have you "Drive". You will tell me what to do, what to tap, on, etc. Does that sound ok?
- [Share your screen]. Can you confirm if you can see my screen?


**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the Cloud.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"** 

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!
