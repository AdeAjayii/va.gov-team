## Research Goals 

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Validate the usability of the updated representative workflow.
- Validate if the new design and copy is likely to improve the percentage of accepted documents (Participants are aware that a medical stipulation is necessary).
- Validate that this question will not cause applicants to drop-off.
- Validate that the updated design/copy better connects the representative question to the signature.

## Research Methodology 

A task-based usability study will be conducted with UXPin, remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract.

### Research Questions

The research questions we sought to address: 

- Are participants uploading a document that can be legally accepted to give them the authority to sign this application on behalf of the Veteran?
- Are participants confused by any particular aspect of the representative workflow?
- Does the current representative workflow stop users from completing the form?
- Are participants clear that the reason for the document upload is to enable them to sign as a representative on behalf of the Veteran?

## Key Findings

1. All participants moved through the "who will sign" selection without friction, and didn't indicate a likelihood of abandonment. 
2. Some participants thought it would help them make a selection if the types of documents accepted/ not accepted were listed on the "who will sign" question page. 
   a. Participants were happy to see that the accepted/not accepted documents is included in the following "document upload" page.
3. Participants that did choose to sign as a representative moved through the document upload page without friction, and didn't indicate a likelihood of abandonment.
4. The updated copy that appears after the document upload is well-received. Participants didn't indicate any negative feelings, but rather appreciated the reminder.
5. The majority of participants demonstrated an awareness that the requirement of a "medical" stipulation specifically would be necessary to prove that a representative has legal authority to sign on behalf of the Veteran.
6. All participants recognized that the "who will sign" question has direct relationship to the signature of the application.
  a. This also resulted in improved clarity once reaching the signature section 
7. Similar to the Mental model and Content-specific comprehension [study findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Sign-as-a%20Rep-Round3-Oct2021/Content%20specific%20research/Research%20findings.md) some participants think that the proof documentation comes from the VA and would like further instruction on how to obtain this document if they don't have it and need to sign on behalf of the Veteran.



## Details of Findings

### All participants moved through the "who will sign" selection without friction, and didn't indicate a likelihood of abandonment. 
By clearly phrasing that this selection is used only for this application signature, participants were easily able to identify who would be signing "today." This copy showed great improvement from the [Mental model and Content-specific comprehension study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Sign-as-a%20Rep-Round3-Oct2021/Content%20specific%20research/Research%20findings.md) on the same topic, in which that iteration caused concern that the right to make medical decisions in the future would be taken away from the Veteran if a representative was selected.

### Some participants thought it would help them make a selection if the types of documents accepted/ not accepted were listed on the "who will sign" question page. 
  ** a. Participants were happy to see that the accepted/not accepted documents is included in the following "document upload" page.**
  
Some participants looked for information about what type of document could be accepted/not accepted while they made the decision of who will sign the application. They seemed relieved that this information is given on the next page, but thought it would be useful to have it both in the introduction and on the "who will sign" page.
   
### Participants that did choose to sign as a representative moved through the document upload page without friction, and didn't indicate a likelihood of abandonment.

All participants that selected that a representative would sign predicted that the next page would be to upload a document as proof. Once reaching that page, they expressed that this seemed self-explanatory, and they said that they would be able to upload a copy of their document without trouble. They appreciated that the types of documents accepted/not accpeted were listed. 

A couple of participants thought that there should be a link or explanation of what to do if a representative did need to sign, but didn't yet have the medical representative documentation. 

### The updated copy that appears after the document upload is well-received. Participants didn't indicate any negative feelings, but rather appreciated the reminder.

All participants who went through the upload a document simulation, received the reminder of "Check your upload before you continue" well. A couple of participants mentioned how easy it is to select the wrong file when uploading, and appreciated the reminder to check the file name. This rewritten message showed great improvement from the [Mental model and Content-specific comprehension study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Sign-as-a%20Rep-Round3-Oct2021/Content%20specific%20research/Research%20findings.md) in which participants felt like the copy that stated that there could be a delay/rejection due to wrong document upload is very negative.

### The majority of participants demonstrated an awareness that the requirement of a "medical" stipulation specifically would be necessary to prove that a representative has legal authority to sign on behalf of the Veteran.

The majority of participants, when asked to explain in their own words the "who will sign" page, specifically mentioned that someone with "medical" authority could sign for the Veteran. 

### All participants recognized that the "who will sign" question has direct relationship to the signature of the application. 

This is likely to result in more Veteran signatures because participants didn't think that adding supporting documents is a requirement for the program or could otherwise support their application. Many caregivers that have a document (such as medical POA) still like to get the Veteran to sign when possible. We saw a much higher rate of selecting that the Veteran would sign compared to [previous research studies.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Sign-as-Rep-Round2-Usability-April%202021/research%20findings.md)
  a. This also resulted in improved clarity once reaching the signature section 


### Similar to the Mental model and Content-specific comprehension [study findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Sign-as-a%20Rep-Round3-Oct2021/Content%20specific%20research/Research%20findings.md) some participants think that the proof documentation comes from the VA and would like further instruction on how to obtain this document if they don't have it and need to sign on behalf of the Veteran.

Some participants felt that it would be useful to provide a link to a VA document that could be filled out to show proof of legal right to medical decisions on behalf of the Veteran. They thought that it's important to provide next steps for someone who doesn't have the paperwork, but needs to sign as a representative on the Veteran's behalf. As pointed out by the SMEs, this isn't a simple process, and would require the applicant to abandon the application and start over. 

We need to look into how to better prepare the applicant before they start the application to avoid waste of time and resulting drop-offs. Additionally, we need to provide brief education/ next steps for a representative that does reach the document upload page. 


## Additional Insights
- One participant brought up a security concern about how will the VA know if someone just signs the Veteran's name. 
- The facility section continues to cause confusion for participants
- The Primary/Secondary Caregiver selection continues to cause confusion to participants
- Applicants could benefit from being able to select "same address" for Veteran and Caregiver
- Participants are uncertain about why the Caregiver is asked if they have insurance and worry that it is a requirement to be in the program. Applicants could benefit if there was an explanation of why this question is asked how it will impact their application. 
- 3 participants were confused by the "Download VA form 10-10CG(PDF)" link on the introduction page. Two participants thought it was the POA form (because of the note immediately below the link). One participant thought this was the only way to fill out the 10-10CG and didn't notice the button to start the application (they filled out the PDF from the link when they applied for the program).
- Participants would like the requirements for becoming a primary/secondary caregiver to be more prominent in the introduction, including:
     -  Difference and expectations for the role of primary and secondary caregivers
     -  That the Veteran is already enrolled in health care
     -  That the caregiver must live with the Veteran (if this is a requirement)
     -  What document proves authority to make medical decisions for the Veteran 

### Other mentions
- Additional section to upload records, including Caregiver daily tasks and ADL record
- Inclusivity of language for Veteran/Caregiver's sex
- Inclusivity of language for significant other (suggested "partner")
- Two participants mentioned that they preferred to fill out applications at the VA library, and it would be helpful if the Caregiver program provided resources to the librarians similar to how the health care application has. 

## Recommendations

**Add what documents can/can't be accepted on the "who will sign" selector page**


**Explore ways to better prepare a representative with the knowledge of the requirements for showing proof of legal authority to make medical decisions on behalf of the Veteran before they start the application**

* Provide a path for those who don't have the paperwork, but need to obtain it.
* As a greater initiative to improve the introduction page, we need to make it more clear that:
     - What document shows proof and a general overview of how it's obtained
     - Layout other requirements such as the Veteran must have health care through the VA
     - Caregiver must live with the Veteran (to be confirmed)
     - Requirements and expectations of a Primary vs. Secondary Caregiver


## Next Steps (TBD)

* Update the design and copy 
    * Add language to the "who will sign" selection page that says what documents can/cannot be accepted 

* Develop and release to 50% of applicants in prod.
* Monitor analytics for and increase in drop-off rate
* Gather data on acceptance rates of uploaded documents
