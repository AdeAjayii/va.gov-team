## Research Goals 

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Validate the usability of the updated representative workflow.
- Validate if the new design and copy is likely to improve the percentage of accepted documents (Participants are aware that a medical stipulation is necessary).
- Validate that this question will not cause applicants to drop-off.
- Validate that the updated design/copy better connects the representative question to the signature.

## Research Methodology 

A task-based usability study will be conducted with UXPin, remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract.


Tools: Zoom, [UX Pin prototype](https://app.uxpin.com/edit/8992489#?id_page=146375940)

### Research Questions

The research questions we sought to address: 

- Are participants uploading a document that can be legally accepted to give them the authority to sign this application on behalf of the Veteran?
- Are participants confused by any particular aspect of the representative workflow?
- Does the current representative workflow stop users from completing the form?
- Are participants clear that the reason for the document upload is to enable them to sign as a representative on behalf of the Veteran?

## Key Findings

1. All participants moved through the "who will sign" question without friction, and didn't indicate a likelihood of abandonment. 
2. Some participants thought it would help them answer this question if the types of documents accepted/ not accepted were listed on the "who will sign" question page. 
   a. Participants were happy to see that the accepted/not accepted documents is included in the following "document upload" page.
3. Participants that did choose to sign as a representative moved through the document upload page without friction, and didn't indicate a likelihood of abandonment.
4. The updated copy that appears after the document upload is well-received. Participants didn't indicate any negative feelings, but rather appreciated the reminder.
5. The majority of participants mentioned a requirement of a "medical" stipulation specifically would be necessary to prove that a representative has legal authority to sign on behalf of the Veteran.
6. All participants recognized that the "who will sign" question has direct relationship to the signature of the application. This is likely to result in more Veteran signatures because participants didn't think that adding supporting documents is a requirement for the program or otherwise support their application. Many caregivers that have a document (such as medical POA) still like to get the Veteran to sign when possible. We saw a much higher rate of selecting that the Veteran would sign compared to [previous research studies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Sign-as-Rep-Round2-Usability-April%202021/research%20findings.md).
  a. This also resulted in improved clarity once reaching the signature section 
7. Similar to the Mental model and Content-specific comprehension [study findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/Sign-as-a%20Rep-Round3-Oct2021/Content%20specific%20research/Research%20findings.md) some participants think that the proof documentation comes from the VA and would like further instruction on how to obtain this document if they don't have it and need to sign on behalf of the Veteran.

## Additional Insights
- One participant brought up a security concern about how will the VA know if someone just signs the Veteran's name. 
- The facility section continues to cause confusion for participants
- The Primary/Secondary Caregiver selection continues to cause confusion to participants
- Applicants could benefit from being able to select "same address" for Veteran and Caregiver
- Participants are uncertain about why the Caregiver is asked if they have insurance and worry that it is a requirement to be in the program. Applicants could benefit if there was an explanation of why this question is asked how it will impact their application. 
- 3 participants were confused by the "Download VA form 10-10CG(PDF)" link on the introduction page. Two participants thought it was the POA form (because of note immediately below the link). One participant thought this was the only way to fill out the 10-10CG and didn't notice the button to start the application (they filled out the PDF from the link when they applied for the program).
- Participants would like the requirements for becoming a primary/secondary caregiver to be more prominent in the introduction, including:
     -  Difference and expectations for the role of primary and secondary caregivers
     -  That the Veteran is already enrolled in health care
     -  That the caregiver must live with the Veteran (if this is a requirement)
     -  What document proves authority to make medical decisions for the Veteran 

### Other mentions
- Additional section to upload records, including Caregiver daily tasks and ADL record
- Inclusivity of language for Veteran/Caregiver's sex
- Inclusivity of language for significant other (suggested "partner")
- Two participants mentioned that they preferred to fill out applications at the VA library, and it would be helpful if the Caregiver program provided resources to the librarians similar to how the health care application has. 

## Recommendations

**Update content**
* Rewrite the question and titles to make it more clear that we are requesting for legal representation for **medical decisions** specifically


**Provide more context**
* Explore the possibility of including a link, form number, and/or explanation of the use for each document type

* Provide a path for those who don't have the paperwork, but need to obtain it

**Design**
* Update flow/UX of current to an adjusted tested version
* Explore the possibility of making this section of the form visually distinct from the rest of the form so that it feels more cohesive with the signature page rather than the application pages
     * Explore the possibility of breaking up the review section and signature section and having the document upload option between them

Future:
* Look into ways of integrating these questions into the signature page
* Implement a “wizard” like flow
* For those who do submit a document that can not be accepted, provide a recourse to just "edit" the application rather than having to complete a whole new one
* Look into the possibility of tying a legal representative document that is already on file with VA to the application


## Next Steps (TBD)

* Work with Caregiver program team to determine if we can provide a link/form number and/or explanation of what each document type gives the rights to do

* Work with copywriter 
     * To clarify that we need a legal document that gives medical decision-making authority
     * To make the questions more direct and concise
     * To make the language around not being able to accept a document causing delay or application rejection less harsh
     * Provide directions for next steps for those who need to obtain the legal representative documentation

* Update design/ UX in iterations
