*Start recording to the Cloud.*

* **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"**

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

**Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

**For Veterans:**

* Tell me a little about yourself.  I live next door to the VA, I spend a lot of time in the VA and I have grown up on their online communication. I volunteered because they are creating a new website and I like to help improve the system for Veterans who are not good at using computers like I am. I am a Veteran.

* Do you currently have a caregiver? If so, tell me a bit about the relationship you have with your caregiver? I am not a caregiver; I do half of my stuff and my wife does the other half of my caregiving. I do not know a lot about the program.

* Are they a family member or friend?

* Do they live with you?

    * If no, how often do they come over to check in on you?

* Does your caregiver receive any benefits from the VA? -If yes, what sort of benefits? -Are you/they part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers?

**For Caregivers:**

* Tell me a little bit about yourself

* Tell me a bit about the relationship you have with the Veteran.

* Do you receive any benefits from the VA?

    * If yes, what sort of benefits?

    * Are you part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers?

**Applying for benefits task with first representative option - 20 minutes**

Now that I understand a little bit more about your background.

**For Veterans:**

Let's say you heard about a way you and your caregiver could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at **insert link**. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits. Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply.

I am on the website because I am interested in the program. I would scroll down the website so I can see everything else. I know I am at the right page because of the title. I would probably start the application prior to read the notes and would come back to read later. VA usually makes everything very simple as long as I follow the steps. I know the VA has all this information so would this website populate this information because that would be great and take the burden off the Veteran. Sometimes to put in the information is difficult for Veterans. I would download the forms. I understand that is something that needs to be done. And if there is a point, I do need help they tell me where to go. It is a PDF it did say something about POA, a legal representative, could be able to fill this out for me as well. That makes sense. It presented to me very simple. I believe in the KISS method, keep it simple Suzy. *Continues to read the rest of the notes prior to starting application* We are talking about enrolled Veterans, correct? If you are not enrolled you have to fill out an application for healthcare, but I assume that most will already be enrolled. If they are not, they should show them the healthcare application first. PGCSS, is that an acronym for the program because I would assume it is. It seems like the VA is giving them a second option, another paragraph, but it should be a headline/highlighted as a second option. After this I would start the application. Starting the application, I just think about the 15 minutes I add 10 – 15 minutes because most of the time. 15 minutes seems fine until I see, but there could be things that could be taken away to shorten the time. There is a lot of help given in case you do not understand certain things. There is a number. It seems like this is a simple thing to apply. I would start the application now. A lot of this could be prepopulate, most Veterans should be able to handle this. I would fill this all out and continue to the next page. *Starts filling out blank fields* I am glad the drop boxes/radio buttons are there to make it easier for the Veterans to fill out. Very well printed and simple. Same information in a simple fashion. I think this is cool. *Clicks next button* I am glad they ask for email because we get a lot of information off the internet. I get so much done on the phone and email. It makes it easy for me. I stay on top of my appointments, medications, and tests online. Some doctors just don’t get back to you, but the ability to find out test results is wonderful. It is also easy on the eyes to read. *Clicks next button* No questions, it is very simple. Shouldn’t the Veteran already know who qualifies for a Primary Caregiver. Shouldn’t that information be on a page prior to this far into the application. It should be on the front page. If you want to get the correct information you need to put it out front.  Let me go back on that one. It asked what the caregiver’s sex, use a different term because I drifted off with that word sex. Something like that because another Veteran’s might drift off as well. *Continues to next page* Yes, the caregiver would have the same address as me. It is usually a spouse. Very simple. *Continues to next page* Healthcare page is easy to click, but why are you asking if they have healthcare? Are you offering healthcare to the caregiver? Maybe they are just wanting to make sure the caregiver has insurance, is there a penalty? It would be helpful to know why you ask and how will it affect the application. There needs to be something else there. There could be many reasons, mostly good reasons, but there needs to be more information on that. You can say caregivers need insurance, and/or you can tell the application how to get coverage if they do not have it. Provide them links to send them somewhere to where to get coverage. Just explain why. *Secondary Family Caregiver page* I would click on here to get more information because it would be nice to have a secondary because one person shouldn’t have to do it all by themselves. *Continues to next page*

**For Caregivers:**

Let's say you heard about a way you could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at **insert link**. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits.

* In your circumstance who do you think would fill out this application? (you or the Veteran)

* Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply.

If they need a SSN, use 548-79-5555

* Remind participants to think out loud.

* Any hiccups? Do they know all the information?

* Any fields trip them up?

* Anything particularly confusing for them?

**On the "Select who will sign for the Veteran today" page**

* *Pay special attention to abandonment risk*

* Anything stand out to you on this page? If I am not able to sign for myself and my wife has permission to sign on my behalf and that information is already in the VA system so she should not have to upload any other proof. Make it simple for the Veterans.

* How did you make your decision? I am filling it out, so I picked Veteran. Usually, my wife is with, so she knows what I am filling out anyways. Just like taxes. On this statement I like it that the VA is telling the caregiver what exactly they expect of them to care for the Veterans. Somewhere we need to insert a list of what the VA wants the caregivers to do to provide safe care for the Veteran. This way they do not go overboard with what they do. Duties required of the caretaker. No more than one paper, but people still need to know what is needed of them. Even more so with the secondary caregiver. Do not allow them to continue if they have not read the duties.

* Do you have any questions about this page or is there anything you would like to know more about?

* Can you explain what this page is asking in your own words?

    * Why do you think the VA asks this?

* What do you think will happen next? Well, we went over the page and now we are at the part where we review and if I need to review anything I would review it. Check 1,2, and 3 then submit the application. I like that you can print the page and it explains what you should do next. How about adding a "YAYYYYY YOU HAVE SUBMITTED YOUR APPLICATION!" Just a couple of changes I think need to be made.

**On document upload page** *- Does the participant have fear that the documentation is a requirement for the program?*

* What documents do they upload here? My wife has medical POA on file at the VA. It takes care of all my decisions. I am not sure if it states she can sign for me, but I assume she can. We got the medical POA off the website. I was ensuring all my paperwork was correct and I saw that option and I ensured my wife could act on my behalf in an emergency. She does not have that information on hand, but she would be able to get a copy from the VA. She could also go to forms.gov and upload it onto the VA website. I like you can upload the document. Nobody wants to drive to the VA, or mail anything in.

    * _What are the participants' mental models of the document needed? Pay special attention to if they specify that the document should have a medical stipulation _

    * What documents do they think won't be accepted?/ Do they notice the "note"?

* What would you do if you felt like you arrived on this page by accident?/ *Do participants notice the yellow box alert?*

**_After participant completes document upload page_**

* In your own words can you tell me what this page is asking you to do?

* On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being not confident at all and 10 being completely confident, how confident or not were you that you were uploading the correct document?

    * Can you tell me why you felt this level of confidence?

    * *If applicable:* What information would you need to feel fully confident? What would you do if you were uncertain?

* What do you think would happen if your document was not accepted? *Pay special attention to their reaction to the "warning" message*

**Post task questions - 10 minutes**

Wonderful! I have a few questions about what you just saw in the prototype.

**Overall

* What did you think of the overall experience in completing this form?

* What was the hardest part of completing the form? Were there any areas you felt were unclear?

* What worked well?

* Do you have any questions for me before we conclude? I am happy I was able to go through this with you and I think it is important the VA kept it simple.

**Thank you and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members. Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
