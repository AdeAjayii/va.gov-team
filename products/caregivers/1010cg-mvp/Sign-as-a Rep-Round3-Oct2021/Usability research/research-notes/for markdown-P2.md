**Conversation Guide: VSA Caregiver, Representative and Primary Caregiver/Secondary for the 10-10CG form, January 2022**

*Start recording to the Cloud.*

* **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?" Sure.**

**Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

**For Veterans:**

* Tell me a little about yourself: Well I have used the va as my first go to for medical care. I have my chemotherapy through the va as well. Generally 95 percent of my healthcare is done through the va. I have a civilian PCP but I use them rarely.

* Does your caregiver receive any benefits from the VA? -If yes, what sort of benefits? -Are you/they part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers? Yes, I am not entirely sure in what capacity but my wife is my caregiver. We have applied for the caregiver system, denied but that’s okay because I knew we were going to be denied because I am feeling better but I wanted her to have access should I or when I get worse when the disease progresses.

* Why were you denied: They did but I can’t really remember it. I believe that it had something to do with my condition now.

* When did you apply: two months ago

* Online in person: I did it online then an interview with my wife and 2 with me. I was evaluated and then one from a doctors point of view.

**Applying for benefits task with first representative option - 20 minutes**

Now that I understand a little bit more about your background.

**For Veterans:**

Let's say you heard about a way you and your caregiver could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at **insert link**. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits.

How long until first contact:

Does this look familiar: Yes. The form 10-10cg I remember that.

 Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply: Do you want me to open the page.

That that what you would do: yes

What would you do it do it online: I didn’t know you could do it online, I download it then sent it off.

Anything on the page that tells you that you could do it online: the form did everything I needed to apply for it. That is what starts everything. It was a quick response; they called a few days after I sent it in.

What do you think that would do when clicked: I think it would bring up the application and I would fill it out according to the directions.

Go ahead and click on it: Okay.

What you expected: Different then what I expected, I thought it would be a copy of the form.

* Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply: Its pretty much upfront.

* Changed medical facility, why: I put the initials out of order so I am correcting that.

* Continuing application: I assume I want to hit yes. Well because it is asking me if I want to apply for benefits and I am saying yes.

* Anything unclear: No because I know what I am doing from the first time. I am applying.

* Continuing: Okay now I am not sure what you want here. Do you want the name of the doctor I use through the va or Medicare.

* What do you think its asking: It is confusing to me, it would be easier if it said primary civilian caregiver or primary va caregiver if you are following me. 

* What would you do: good question. Because it says family I would probably put my medical doctors name here because it says primary family caregiver and that’s not the va.

* Continuing: Primary care giver SSN, oh wait a minute. I am sorry I misunderstood this. Its not asking for the doctor it is asking who my caregiver will be

* Who do you think it is now: I would put my wife’s name in there.

* Did you or your wife fill it out last time: I did.

* Continuing: The drop downs not working, oh there it is. I would click yes.

* More about thoughts: She already qualifies for CHAMPVA but she doesn’t have a secondary. Wait till hit no I thought it was different. I only half read it, I thought it was asking to apply for secondary family caregiver but I don’t have a need for that.

* What is this asking: I think it is asking if my wife needs help or can not longer do it, is there a secondary family caregiver. All of my kids are in Pittsburgh.

* Continuing: I would sign this.

* Questions or anything unclear: no not really it is just asking who will be signing it.

* Ever a time where your wife signs for you: if I an incapacitated I filled a form out that gives her POA.

* Know on this form, would it qualify in this case: Well it says a representative with legal authority. Yes I would say she does.

* POA has medical stimulation: It is a medical POA.

* Rate wife’s confidence level with the document: I would say 90 percent, she does everything to help me now if I need it.

**Post task questions - 10 minutes**

Wonderful! I have a few questions about what you just saw in the prototype.

* What did you think of the overall experience in completing this form? I thought it was fine, you know I wouldn’t have made mistakes if I fully read these things.

* Was download to this one difference: this one was much easier I thought.

* Future, if needing to fill it out again which would you do: I would choose this.

* Anything you wish you would have known more about: I don’t need anything else the form is self-explanatory.
