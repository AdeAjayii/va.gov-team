**Conversation Guide: VSA Caregiver, Representative and Primary Caregiver/Secondary for the 10-10CG form, January 2022**

*Start recording to the Cloud.*

* **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"**

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

**Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

**For Veterans:**

* Tell me a little about yourself

* Do you currently have a caregiver? If so, tell me a bit about the relationship you have with your caregiver?

* Are they a family member or friend?

* Do they live with you?

    * If no, how often do they come over to check in on you?

* Does your caregiver receive any benefits from the VA? -If yes, what sort of benefits? -Are you/they part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers?

**For Caregivers:**

* Tell me a little bit about yourself. My name is Shawn Moore, I am the wife of a 23-year Army Veteran I am his caregiver through the PFC

* Tell me a bit about the relationship you have with the Veteran. So, my primary role with my husband is on the safety and supervision. It has been a crap show through the past year. He deals with depression and anxiety, he disassociates. He is suicidal I manage our finances, and I can task him with things, but he gets lost in the sauce. It is a lot, but I am still my own person I have completed my Masters’ degree. I am not one to sit around. I it just the nature of who I am.

* Do you receive any benefits from the VA?

    * If yes, what sort of benefits?

    * Are you part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers? I joined 2013. I applied on paper at that time. It is a really loaded question. So, when I first came on the program I did not like, and I did not feel like I got the support. My husband gets majority services through Leavenworth VA my care workers are amazing. They keep up with us, always reach out, I absolutely love my staff, but the larger program is crap right now and a lot of people think the same thing but there is nothing that can not be done. In the climate I have seen the mental health space that I have seen is not great. If I wasn’t here my husband would be dead. I am not happy with it, my friends are not happy, and a lot of caregivers are not happy.

**Applying for benefits task with first representative option - 20 minutes**

Now that I understand a little bit more about your background.

**For Veterans:**

Let's say you heard about a way you and your caregiver could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at **insert link**. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits. Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply.

**For Caregivers:**

Let's say you heard about a way you could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at **insert link**. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits.

It looks familiar so the VA logo the blue it looks like any other VA page I would pull up. I share this application quite a bit so this is what it would look like for people I think should apply to this program. The veteran crisis line number.

* Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply. I like how it says application, but I would go all the way through to see what all I would need, and I wouldn’t download the form, but I do like that others would download it for the older caregivers have that option. I like that it tells me to make sure I am completing the form and which ones are already completed. I like the note that if the Veteran is not enrolled, but I think it needs to be bigger to show that it is important information and it needs to be on top. I think a lot of people miss that the Veteran is enrolled at the VA and establish that care or they will not be approved if the care is not established. If you start the application without reading that they would be upset if they come across that later. It should be on top. The next thing I would do is click on start your application once I am done scrolling. I would fill out this information for my husband because he did not even know about this program. He did not know half the things he was eligible for until I came around.

* In your circumstance who do you think would fill out this application? (you or the Veteran) If they need a SSN, use 548-79-5555

That is actually his number. I as his caregiver would put my number in here (alternate) because he never answers his phone. Just thinking about the name of the hospital had me thinking maybe this should be a drop down because something you do not know the names of the different hospitals he goes to. I think that would be good to have name and location of all the hospitals. So is this statement here Please select the VA medical center or clinic, is that if there never received treatment. My initial thought goes back to the previous page that they have to be enrolled in VA, but here it makes you wonder where they would receive care as if they haven’t yet. So, I see this might not be a VA right here it may be another hospital if you get care outside of the VA.

* Remind participants to think out loud.

* Any hiccups? Do they know all the information? My confidence level if I read everything would be a 10, but because I stumbled, I would say an 8. It is not clear upon initial arrival. I do think that if someone is already engaged at the VA would question why are they filling this out twice?  I think it is good that you can click on who else is qualified to apply. I know individuals who do not know everything they need to so they can click on that link to see if they qualify. Honestly, I do not want to fill out anything if I don’t qualify. This needs to be up front. I work with numerous non-profits for caregivers and a social worker for the VA and there is so much misinformation because the transparent information from the VA needs to be up front and center. Transparency is key. I do not know how the VA is coming along with asking if you are female or male, but you need to be able to notate if you do not relate to either gender. I think there should be a box to click to say same as Veteran’s address, so I do not need to fill this all out again. I also would not list anyone else as an alternative, and I wouldn’t put my work down.  I was looking at the choices for relationships, you should add partner instead of significant other to include everyone. I know why you are asking about health care coverage, but I think you should explain why you need to know this and how it is going to affect the application process. Explain if you do not have healthcare, you may be eligible for CHAMP VA insurance as a benefit to being part of the program. Here *Secondary Family Caregiver*, but they need to understand that if they want a secondary, they need to know what they will be needed to do. They would need to be there for wellness appointments to be on the same page as the primary. It needs to be explained prior to someone just listing an individual as secondary. When it talks about representative needs legal authority is it what is given from the VA or a legal POA. I am thinking since it is for the VA, they are going to want the specific paperwork from the VA. Explain what documents can qualify as legal authority. What if I upload the wrong document and go through this all and it holds up the process?

* Any fields trip them up?

* Anything particularly confusing for them?

**On the "Select who will sign for the Veteran today" page**

* *Pay special attention to abandonment risk*

* Anything stand out to you on this page?

* How did you make your decision? I have the proper forms so I would click on representative with legal authority. I am at a 6 in confidence because it did not tell me what documents are needed.

* Do you have any questions about this page or is there anything you would like to know more about?

* Can you explain what this page is asking in your own words?

    * Why do you think the VA asks this?

* What do you think will happen next?

**On document upload page** *- Does the participant have fear that the documentation is a requirement for the program?*

* What documents do they upload here? Now it tells me what documents are needs, which is great. I like it I like it. I always get ahead of myself. Yeah, I think it is good they have a list, but I think it should be on the page prior. Confidence level now on this page on uploading documents is 100%. I do like they tell you what not to upload as well. I wonder if older Veteran or caregiver if they are unable to sign the document what are they going to do? Maybe they do not have that, and if you they of the role of husband and wife in the older generation would not allow wives to have those documents. You should have another option. 

    * _What are the participants' mental models of the document needed? Pay special attention to if they specify that the document should have a medical stipulation _

    * What documents do they think won't be accepted?/ Do they notice the "note"?

* What would you do if you felt like you arrived on this page by accident?/ *Do participants notice the yellow box alert?*

**_After participant completes document upload page_**

* In your own words can you tell me what this page is asking you to do? I would hit upload and complete the application.

* On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being not confident at all and 10 being completely confident, how confident or not were you that you were uploading the correct document? I am 100% confident.

    * Can you tell me why you felt this level of confidence?

    * *If applicable:* What information would you need to feel fully confident? What would you do if you were uncertain?

* What do you think would happen if your document was not accepted? *Pay special attention to their reaction to the "warning" message I*

* It would hold up your application time. I think this message is great. When you are clicking around your computer you might hit the wrong document, and I like it shows that you uploaded the correct document and tells you to check you uploaded correct document. I think before getting to this Veteran’s statement of truth should on here in the beginning. I would put my name in the box because I have the documents, but if I go back to when I first got into the program, I would have put Brain’s name.

**Post task questions - 10 minutes**

Wonderful! I have a few questions about what you just saw in the prototype.

**Overall

* What did you think of the overall experience in completing this form? I think you did a great job, but there are a few things I would do differently.

* What was the hardest part of completing the form? Were there any areas you felt were unclear?

* What worked well?

* Do you have any questions for me before we conclude? You can either be part of the problem or part of the solution, and I want to be part of the solution.

**Thank you and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members. Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
