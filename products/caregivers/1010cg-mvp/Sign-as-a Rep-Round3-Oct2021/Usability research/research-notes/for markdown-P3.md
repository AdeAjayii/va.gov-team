**Conversation Guide: VSA Caregiver, Representative and Primary Caregiver/Secondary for the 10-10CG form, January 2022**

*Start recording to the Cloud.*

* **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"**

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

**Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

**For Veterans:**

* Tell me a little about yourself.

* Do you currently have a caregiver? If so, tell me a bit about the relationship you have with your caregiver?

* Are they a family member or friend?

* Do they live with you?

    * If no, how often do they come over to check in on you?

* Does your caregiver receive any benefits from the VA? -If yes, what sort of benefits? -Are you/they part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers?

**For Caregivers:**

* Tell me a little bit about yourself.  I am a military spouse, caregiver, but also a Veteran. And we use the VA for our healthcare.

* Tell me a bit about the relationship you have with the Veteran. He is my husband.

* Do you receive any benefits from the VA?

    * If yes, what sort of benefits? I am aware of it.

    * Are you part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers? I am familiar with it, but I have been denied like 4 times already. They do not give me a good reason; they state that my husband’s medical records do not show he needs one. I was discharged from the Army to care for him, and I have a remote job so I can stay home and care for him. So clearly their idea of caregiving does not line up with the Army’s opinion and what he needs. Although I check all the boxes for the ADLs I just don’t qualify. The last time I applied was a few months after they updated the system. Nurses told me to reapply when they updated it. It was sometime within the last year. I did the new online application for the most recent time. It was something similar to this, but it was not easy to get to. I had to go to an article about the program being revamped to find a link, or in a caregiver group that I am in. I filled out the application and it is common for me to do this for my husband.

**Applying for benefits task with first representative option - 20 minutes**

Now that I understand a little bit more about your background.

**For Veterans:**

Let's say you heard about a way you and your caregiver could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at **insert link**. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits. Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply.

* In your circumstance who do you think would fill out this application? (you or the Veteran) I would go through the page to see if there is any new additional forms I need, new information, or additional resources. Just going through to see what I need to complete the application. A lot of these things require additional paperwork that Veterans need to sign to release medical paperwork. I don’t see anything that would stand out. Is that VA form CG 10-10CG thing is that a release of information form or something. I would it is something I would need to fill out since it gives you the option to print out. I would download that form, and then check to see if there is anything else I need to download. It is not very clear if that is needed so it should be more clear.  It is clearly listed on the information I would need. I would first download that form and see if there is anything else I need to download. But that is not clear if I need to download that form or not. Needs to be clearer. I do not need help with filling this out or anything so I would just fill out the application. I also appreciate they give you a time estimate it should take you to fill this all out because sometimes when you fill things out online it can get lengthy.

* Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply.

If they need a SSN, use 548-79-5555

*Participant starts filling in the blanks* This is pretty straight forward. *Continues to fill out all blanks* I was scrolling down, and it bumped me to the next page, and I did not select that. It is jumping around and now it is blank. I would say for the email address, have them use the same email address for Myhealthevet to make it all the same for the spouse. Another way to verify identity. I do have a question about the recent medical care. Why do you have to put that information if you have to put down where is the last VA hospital you went to. Right under you must put in the VA your spouse is register at. It does not make sense. What is the difference? Why are you asking for both? Has it been there since the beginning of time? Are they looking for specific injury or to find where they go to physical therapy? I literally put the same information in both spots because my husband receives care only there unless he gets a referral out. Does that make a difference if the Veteran is getting care elsewhere? Does that have an impact? I know others who go out for care it is because the length of time it takes for the Veteran to get an appointment, or the VA does not offer the care the Veteran needs. The is silly too. No duh I am applying for Primary Family Caregiver that is why I am filling out this application. If I am doing this as one person, why would you offer me to do it as the secondary? I also understand why it asks for the primary care caregiver address rather than the Veteran, but doesn’t it require you to live with the Veteran because of all the ADLs that are required. Why doesn’t it just ask do you live with the Veteran, and if you click no then you put in the address. Whereas if you live in the house with the person, it is clear that you are there more frequently other if you do not live with them. I do wonder how often a person outside of immediate being the primary caregiver. I know sometimes it is a friend if Veteran is single or does not have anyone. To be a primary family caregiver, it really knocks out some of the options it gives you to click on. At the beginning it says who qualifies as a family primary caregiver, so maybe make sure that the options given match up with that link at the beginning. This one is pretty straight forward, but once again it would be nice to know if it affects our eligibility if I have healthcare for myself. How is this information used and how is it used to determine out eligibility? I wonder what hurt me when I went through my application. Just because I have healthcare, I hope it doesn’t hurt our chances just because I am not a burden on the system. I never thought if it affects our application process. But yes, I answer it honestly. Here is where I think there should be a split. Secondary Family Caregiver. If I am applying for primary I am obviously not applying for secondary. And right here I could just put my husband’s information without him even in the room and click on the box. There is no way to verify it.

* Remind participants to think out loud.

* Any hiccups? Do they know all the information?

* Any fields trip them up?

* Anything particularly confusing for them?

**On the "Select who will sign for the Veteran today" page**

* *Pay special attention to abandonment risk*

* Anything stand out to you on this page?  How did you make your decision? Normally I am with my husband when filling this out, but I also have medical POA, so I just picked this one. Should I know to have the POA if I am picking a representative with legal authority. I mean I am sure there is a time that I had to sign for his medical care. Even if he is next to me, I am filling out everything for him, education, house, and health falls on me.

* When did you first get the medical POA? I got it when we had a medical emergency the EMS team said they technically do not have to listen to her, but she clearly understood what he needed they recommended her to get a medical POA. The VA, nor another medical team recommended her to get it until then. It has been beneficial since then. I got it through JAG when he was getting med boarded.

* Do you have any questions about this page or is there anything you would like to know more about? No further questions. This application is just like the one I filled out before.

* Can you explain what this page is asking in your own words?

    * Why do you think the VA asks this?

* What do you think will happen next? I would assume that it would take me to a page that it would have me upload a document to prove I have permission to sign for him. It is exactly what I thought. It is asking for a POA. There is not security if they do not have a POA to go back to click on Veteran’s signature and just fill it out for them. Have an option to save and come back option would be great. I would click on the upload document and put it in. I do have it saved in a drop box somewhere with all our caregiver paperwork. It only gives you the option to upload one document so I would just go forward. This section is repetitive. Shorten it and make it more to the point.

**On document upload page** *- Does the participant have fear that the documentation is a requirement for the program?*

* What documents do they upload here?

    * _What are the participants' mental models of the document needed? Pay special attention to if they specify that the document should have a medical stipulation _

    * What documents do they think won't be accepted?/ Do they notice the "note"?

* What would you do if you felt like you arrived on this page by accident?/ *Do participants notice the yellow box alert?*

**_After participant completes document upload page_**

* In your own words can you tell me what this page is asking you to do?

* On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being not confident at all and 10 being completely confident, how confident or not were you that you were uploading the correct document?

    * Can you tell me why you felt this level of confidence?

    * *If applicable:* What information would you need to feel fully confident? What would you do if you were uncertain?

* What do you think would happen if your document was not accepted? *Pay special attention to their reaction to the "warning" message*

**Post task questions - 10 minutes**

Wonderful! I have a few questions about what you just saw in the prototype.

**Overall

* What did you think of the overall experience in completing this form?

* What was the hardest part of completing the form? Were there any areas you felt were unclear?

* What worked well?

* Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?

I wonder in all the time I have done these applications; I know this is the initial start, but it would be beneficial to have a section to be able to upload all the supporting documents, so everything is in one place. In the past there was a mistake made where someone else’s documents were attached to my application that had nothing to do with us, and that was the reason we were denied. So instead of sending information through email, we can have all his supporting documents attached to his initial application, so we do not have to go back to send it later. They would have it already. There is no way to confirm they received any of the information later. But if it is attached at this time there is no way for it to be attached to any other’s application. I think security and information gets received so no one is forgotten or left on the wayside. It is a learning process.

**Thank you and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members. Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
