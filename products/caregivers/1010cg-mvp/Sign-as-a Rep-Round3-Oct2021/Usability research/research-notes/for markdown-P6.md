**Conversation Guide: VSA Caregiver, Representative and Primary Caregiver/Secondary for the 10-10CG form, January 2022**

*Start recording to the Cloud.*

* **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?" Yes it is**

**Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

**For Veterans:**

* Tell me a little about yourself: I am a veteran; disability and I get probably 90 percent of medical through the VA

* Do you currently have a caregiver? If so, tell me a bit about the relationship you have with your caregiver? Well my wife if I need something she takes care of me. I am pretty decent and can get around and take care of myself.

* Does your caregiver receive any benefits from the VA? -If yes, what sort of benefits? -Are you/they part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers? I have heard of the assistance for caregivers but I haven’t never really gotten into it. The benefits and how you, I have seen some things on ebenefits or myhealthevet about caregivers. I have seen stuff on there about it.

**Applying for benefits task with first representative option - 20 minutes**

**For Veterans:**

* Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply: well I see here it says start your application, I imagine you’d go there. Then it gives guidance here. Yeah where it says start application. Then its asking me information, you want me to fill this out. Want me to just put in a random number.

* Anything that stood out: no everything was self-explanatory.

* Continuing: Do you need the emails or no. If I were filling it out I would put the email because I would want more than one way to be gotten ahold of.

* Anything stood out: no its just common sense. Cant get no plainer than it was I think.

* Continuing: Medical facility I assume that would be the local va.  Oh recent medical care, for me that would be the VA is what I would put in there.

* Is it not clear: Well it says recent medical care so the last care I got was at the VA so that’s what it would be for me.

* Anything else that could make it clearer: I would think, medical care would eb where I get my treatment at and it says last receiving medical treatment and that’s what I would put there.

* Continuing: How would you answer the hospital or clinic. Well I mean originally designed as a hospital but they added urgent care and theres other clinics in there. I would have to go with hospital as the primary answer

* If I weren’t here would it stop you or try to find out more: I would put hospital and move on myself

* Questions: no just that I mean you know the one I go to, actually both of them have clinics and hospital capabilities and that’s where I go get my healthcare from. Some aren’t available at the one and sometimes I am sent to the other. It could eb answered either way and it would be correct.

* Continuing: If I were looking at it as a caregiver I would click yes.

* Confusing: no it is self-explanatory there

* Continuing:  This is wanting to know who the caregiver would be and we would put there information in there.

* When filling out applications is it typically you that fills them out: for the most part I do when it comes to the VA. If I need help I will ask my wife but most of the time its me.

* On the computer, phone or paper: The biggest part I have done for the VA has been through the library in their computer system. that recently went away for us and I don’t know why. I thought it would come open but I don’t see it open. I miss it

* People to assist: Yes that’s why I did it there because if there were something I didn’t know what it wanted I could ask them and that would help us. I kind of miss that and wish they would bring it back.

* Continuing: That would just be the address here.

* In your case is it the same as yours for the caregiver: yes

* Button useful for same as: yes absoutely it would be wonderful.

* Continuing: Well I guess I will put her email in there real quick. I don’t understand the relationship on it has a drop down but it didn’t drop down. Of it did when I clicked in it.  that was pretty self-explanatory

* Questions: no

* Continuing: I am taking this as if there were a second person as a caregiver like a daughter incase the spouse couldn’t. then you would answer infomration there on them

* Anything to make it clearer: No it is pretty clear to me. I would say no and move on.

* Continuing: I would sign if I were able to or they click this and sign for the veteran. I am capable so click this.   That is simple  besides that one thing. I can do it. review application, I should be able to click and see the information for all sections. Then its wanting me to enter my name certifying that everything is true. I would put my name there since I signed for myself. I would click on that box there and then this is staying that I could get kicked out of the program if I didn’t follow it. then put the name there of the caregiver and acknowledge that if they don’t go by the rules they’ll be kicked out. Put there name there. Click on that box to acknowledge this. On a real one it would submit it. Then it tells me I was successful submitting and gives me the date and a link to print.

* Questions thoughts: no it is self-explanatory

* Moved through quickly, how did you feel when you got to this page: to me this page right here is just wanting to know who is submitting the application. To me since I did it that’s why I choose the veteran. That’s the way I take this page.

**Post task questions - 10 minutes**

Wonderful! I have a few questions about what you just saw in the prototype.

* What did you think of the overall experience in completing this form? A lot easier than a lot of other stuff I have done.

* Any part that caused issues: No I don’t think I had trouble with any of it.

This was easy, those few things. This is the easier application as far as the va is concerned. Normally I have to dig things up and do research. This is much better.
