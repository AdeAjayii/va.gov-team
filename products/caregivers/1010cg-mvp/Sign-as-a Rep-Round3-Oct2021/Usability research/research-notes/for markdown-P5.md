**Conversation Guide: VSA Caregiver, Representative and Primary Caregiver/Secondary for the 10-10CG form, January 2022**

*Start recording to the Cloud.*

* **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"**

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

**Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

**For Veterans:**

* Tell me a little about yourself

* Do you currently have a caregiver? If so, tell me a bit about the relationship you have with your caregiver?

* Are they a family member or friend?

* Do they live with you?

    * If no, how often do they come over to check in on you?

* Does your caregiver receive any benefits from the VA? -If yes, what sort of benefits? -Are you/they part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers?

**For Caregivers:**

* Tell me a little bit about yourself. I am a caregiver

* Tell me a bit about the relationship you have with the Veteran.  I am a daughter to a 98 yrs. old Veteran. I do everything for him all ADLs, IADLs, medications, bathing, dressing, safety, etc. everything in the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. I am a level 2 caregiver.

* Do you receive any benefits from the VA? Yes.

    * If yes, what sort of benefits?

* Are you part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers? Since October 1, 2020. The first thing I did I completed the paperwork September 30th so I can have someone drop it off by October 1 because you couldn’t turn it in early. And in order for it to be time/date stamped I had to do it that way. Then October 1 it was available online, so I did it there as well.

**Applying for benefits task with first representative option - 20 minutes**

Now that I understand a little bit more about your background.

**For Veterans:**

Let's say you heard about a way you and your caregiver could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at **insert link**. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits. Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply.

**For Caregivers:**

Let's say you heard about a way you could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at **insert link**. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits.

* In your circumstance who do you think would fill out this application? (you or the Veteran)

* Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply.

*Clicks on start application* I would fill out the information. Date of birth is real. And click on next page. Do I need to put the real information? *Continues to fill out the boxes* It is easier to put in the real information because I am getting confused. I do not like that you have to put in the numbers on a different line than the street name. It won’t flag me if I do not put the same information, does it? This is easier on the phone. This is easy because I have done this so many times. Also, Google has fill ins. I made up my social security. The phone is easier. I do not like typing. The phone is so much easier. The caregivers that I did this with that has Google were able to auto populate. It would be easier if there was a box I could click that states I live at the same address.

If they need a SSN, use 548-79-5555

* Remind participants to think out loud.

* Any hiccups? Do they know all the information?

* Any fields trip them up?

* Anything particularly confusing for them?

**On the "Select who will sign for the Veteran today" page**

* *Pay special attention to abandonment risk*

* Anything stand out to you on this page?

* How did you make your decision? I would sign because I have POA so I can sign for him. He is here he can also sign it. I would sign only if he were not here.

* Do you have any questions about this page or is there anything you would like to know more about?

* Can you explain what this page is asking in your own words?

    * Why do you think the VA asks this?

* What do you think will happen next? Once you hit submit you can call the line to ensure they received the application. So, you should have that number so they know they can call. Also, I would like the option to be able to save as a PDF for my records.

**On document upload page** *- Does the participant have fear that the documentation is a requirement for the program?*

* What documents do they upload here? I have all the documents and everything is on file at the VA so I feel 10 on confident since documents have been on file since 2007.

    * _What are the participants' mental models of the document needed? Pay special attention to if they specify that the document should have a medical stipulation _

    * What documents do they think won't be accepted?/ Do they notice the "note"?

* What would you do if you felt like you arrived on this page by accident?/ *Do participants notice the yellow box alert?*

**_After participant completes document upload page_**

* In your own words can you tell me what this page is asking you to do? So, the documents would have to be on my computer to upload it and if not, I have a scanner that I could scan it and upload my power of attorney. Legally that is the paperwork you would send in, that is what the lawyer said. I have done this so many times. I do this all the time for travel, so it is not hard. And I would hit continue. I am familiar with this. If I haven’t done it as often as I have I might have issues. I have helped other caregivers when they are having issues.

* On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being not confident at all and 10 being completely confident, how confident or not were you that you were uploading the correct document?

    * Can you tell me why you felt this level of confidence?

    * *If applicable:* What information would you need to feel fully confident? What would you do if you were uncertain?

* What do you think would happen if your document was not accepted? *Pay special attention to their reaction to the "warning" message*

**Post task questions - 10 minutes**

Wonderful! I have a few questions about what you just saw in the prototype.

**Overall

* What did you think of the overall experience in completing this form? Just so you know it is hard to find the link. You can not save it. There should be a saved feature. You should be able to save and continue at a later time. This is easy. I knew when I saw this, I have does this so many times with friends. Some do not realize that it needs to be the same throughout the whole application process. Everything needs to match. Signatures need to match. Other issues when you finish application you should save pdf in case you are not a printer near you. You should also be able to go back and edit if you put information in the system incorrectly. Also, if you want to go to the next level what do you do? I found out where I needed to go, but some do not know what to look for to know how to level. A copy of application and the status should be available. If you link to the application, you should have a log of how far you have gone through the process, with a checklist, who you have talked to, and what else is needed to complete the process.  The signing in is easy, but the uploading and naming is an issue. You cannot enter commas. Also, I think the documents should be available to us. On myhealthevet the documents should be available to caregivers. Transparency of the requirements and a checklist of documents to check off so everyone can see everything is there. Connected to everyone. We never have the opportunity to share our opinions with you. I think the application we fill out should be available somewhere. I can screen shot the application, but you can only print and saving option is only for the receipt that it was completed not the whole application. There should be an iPad at the VA library or information desk to help caregivers and Veterans fill out the application. The letter we get to accept us into the program should also be scanned into the myhealthevet system.

* What was the hardest part of completing the form? Were there any areas you felt were unclear?

* What worked well?

* Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?

**Thank you and Closing**

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to improve our products and services for Veterans and service members. Great, thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
