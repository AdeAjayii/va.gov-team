*Start recording to the Cloud.*

* **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"**

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!

**Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

**For Veterans:**

* Tell me a little about yourself

* Do you currently have a caregiver? If so, tell me a bit about the relationship you have with your caregiver?

* Are they a family member or friend?

* Do they live with you?

    * If no, how often do they come over to check in on you?

* Does your caregiver receive any benefits from the VA? -If yes, what sort of benefits? -Are you/they part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers?

**For Caregivers:**

* Tell me a little bit about yourself. I am a caregiver to my husband he served 21 years in the army. He did not want to get out but he was med boarded out for mental health out of Germany. We are in Virginia. I have become a caregiver to him because he never feels safe, he does unsafe things so he feels safe. We have 2 small children in the house and an older child out of the home. When I can not be with him someone comes over to sit with him to keep an eye on him.

* Tell me a bit about the relationship you have with the Veteran.

* Do you receive any benefits from the VA?

    * If yes, what sort of benefits?

    * Are you part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers? Yes, I am. I have heard for it for a while and finally I applied and accepted. I was one of those who got in under the legacy act. We have been in program for a year, but I was his caregiver for 3 years. I have met other wives who told me about the program. When I filled out the application, I originally tried in person at the VA but was told to do it online so I ended up doing it all online. It was fast and easy to fill so I didn’t have any issues filling it out. It just took me a while to fill out because I thought it would have taken me longer or more paperwork required.

**Applying for benefits task with first representative option - 20 minutes**

Now that I understand a little bit more about your background.

**For Veterans:**

Let's say you heard about a way you and your caregiver could receive benefits from the VA, and that you could apply online at VA.gov. You have navigated to the screen we are looking at **insert link**. Now let's imagine you've decided you'd like to apply for these benefits. Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply.

* In your circumstance who do you think would fill out this application? (you or the Veteran) Yes this looks familiar.

* Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply. I would scroll down the page to make sure I have everything I need, or if there is any further information I may need before starting the application. The line going down the page caught my eye; with information I may need to gather before I started. *Starts filling in the blank fields* This is a very simple and easy page. So at this point I am looking at the top bars that is telling me where I am during the application. It is nice to know that this process is not as long as I thought it would be. I would think each bar represents the same amount of time for each page. Not sure why I think that, but I do feel that way. I will say I was nervous when it asks for his email because it goes to his phone because I was worried, I would not get the email. I was able to get his email on my phone so I will also get the information. I would screenshot the Need help portion so I have that information in case I need that later in the application or when I was finished with the process and have questions. *Continues to fill in blank fields* I feel like my spouse gets all his information from the Fort Lee hospital I was hoping there was a place where I would be able to list the other places, he gets services because I want them to get all his records. I decided to pick the VA because this is for the Caregiver Program, and I would hope they would allow me to submit the other medical records. Also, anywhere else they allow me to click to get more information I click to see if there is any other person who would qualify to be a secondary caregiver, but I saw that it was a difficult position so I decided to wait until I got into the program to see if a secondary would be needed. *Continues to fill in blank fields* I felt like all the information was easy to understand and didn’t think anything of it. At this point they are asking for the address of caregiver, and I was thinking who could not live with them? It would be good if they have a box to click if you have the same address and if not, you can input the different address caregiver lives at. I think that would just be easier. I like that they make you confirm the email address because sometimes I am in a rush and input it incorrectly because it can case issues if I make a mistake. I like that you have to enter that in twice. Here I would carry on to the next page. I thought about this here I wonder why they ask me this (healthcare coverage), my husband explained to me that if I didn’t have insurance that I could get insurance to be seen at the VA. Honestly, I thought they were asking because they wanted to ensure I was taking care of myself so I can take care of him. It would be helpful if it was explained why they are asking about healthcare. Here I would click on here to get more information on the secondary family caregiver, but I figured I’d get approved first and if needed we would add someone else later.

If they need a SSN, use 548-79-5555

* Remind participants to think out loud.

* Any hiccups? Do they know all the information?

* Any fields trip them up?

* Anything particularly confusing for them?

**On the "Select who will sign for the Veteran today" page**

* *Pay special attention to abandonment risk*

* Anything stand out to you on this page? I would read everything here to make sure I read every word to ensure I had everything correct. I would screen shot everything so I can explain to my husband what I signed. My husband told me to sign for him, but I told him he should sign, and he said I should just sign. He suggested we get legal documents, but we have not done that yet.* * I would expand anything that I can expand to get all the information.

* How did you make your decision? I would sign for him on days where he is not having a good day/normal day where he would not want to/refusing/can sign. As far as things like this I can usually get him to sign.

* Do you have any questions about this page or is there anything you would like to know more about?

* Can you explain what this page is asking in your own words? I explained to my husband what they wanted him to agree with and then he signed it.

    * Why do you think the VA asks this?

* What do you think will happen next? I would think a page that tells me to upload a form stating I have legal permission to sign from him or even have a form there for me to prove I have permission. Like a POA to be uploaded or they have one on file and I need to sign. I would read all the way down and submit. And I would screenshot and printed the page

**On document upload page** *- Does the participant have fear that the documentation is a requirement for the program?*

* What documents do they upload here? *Reading all text to understand what is needed for the portion of the application* So I would just, if I had the POA I would have that in a folder, and I would just upload it at the time. If I didn’t have it on me, I would stop and get so I can upload it.  If I didn’t have those forms I would Google it or search in the VA for obtaining a POA for a Veteran.

    * _What are the participants' mental models of the document needed? Pay special attention to if they specify that the document should have a medical stipulation _

    * What documents do they think won't be accepted?/ Do they notice the "note"?

* What would you do if you felt like you arrived on this page by accident?/ *Do participants notice the yellow box alert? *I would be nice to have the option to print off a POA and get it all signed and notarized. I would tell my friends they needed a medical POA, how long it took me to fill out, and that they have the option that you could add a secondary if they needed. Prior to me getting into the program all the problems overshadowed the ease of signing up for the program.

**_After participant completes document upload page_**

* In your own words can you tell me what this page is asking you to do?

* On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being not confident at all and 10 being completely confident, how confident or not were you that you were uploading the correct document?

    * Can you tell me why you felt this level of confidence?

    * *If applicable:* What information would you need to feel fully confident? What would you do if you were uncertain? It would be nice to know what to except next because my husband would ask me the timeline and I wouldn’t have an answer. So, I am jumping from person and websites about the process so I can explain to him. So just having a timeline of what to expect would be nice.

* What do you think would happen if your document was not accepted? *Pay special attention to their reaction to the "warning" message *I just create a folder that has that document in it and so I would upload and know that it is the correct documents.

**Post task questions - 10 minutes**

Wonderful! I have a few questions about what you just saw in the prototype.

**Overall

* What did you think of the overall experience in completing this form?

* What was the hardest part of completing the form? Were there any areas you felt were unclear?

* What worked well?

* Do you have any questions for me before we conclude? I have the Facebook portals which has been helpful to keep him connected with his family. Finically it has been great to help me feel like I am bringing in money into the house and makes me know my time helping is worth something. I have a great support system in the program with friends who are also in the program. I have had anxiety about getting kicked out of the program.

**Thank you and Closing**
