**Conversation Guide: VSA Caregiver, Representative and Primary Caregiver/Secondary for the 10-10CG form, January 2022**

*Start recording to the Cloud.*

* **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?" Yes.**

**Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes**

**For Veterans:**

* Tell me a little about yourself: my name is Cynthia Chaney; I am a veteran of 20 years. I get most of my care through the va but I still pay for Tricare. I prefer the va because I am more comfortable in that setting. I am a caregiver as well. My father is a Vietnam vet, I am the caregiver and fiduciary so I interact with the va on his behalf. My ex is a veteran as well so I do his appointments. I care for myself and two others.

**For Caregivers:**

    * Are you part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers? No

    * Hear of it: If that’s the same as the caregivers program. I have heard of it but when I tried to sign my dad up for it when it first  came out he didn’t qualify because he isnt post 911 for me to receive the stipend for caring for him. I just do everything on my own.

    * Last applied:  it was right before covid so 2019.

    * Online or paper: I initially did it online then they sent me a paper just like online. I did fill it out and I talked to my dad about having someone come in and he was uncomfortable with that as well. Even though we didn’t meet the requirements for payments we could get some care but he wasn’t comfortable at that time so we haven’t pursue it.

**Applying for benefits task with first representative option - 20 minutes**

**For Caregivers:**

* Page look familiar: not this page, this one is different then what I filled out.

* In your circumstance who do you think would fill out this application?

* Go ahead and show us what you would do to apply: Um. I would start the application and input the basic infomration it is asking me for. Oh veterans name, sometimes I’ll say hold up its for my dad not me so ill have to do it a second time.  These drop boxes I hate because a lot of the time the mouse is sensitive and it takes 5 minutes to get the birthday in, oh I didn’t know I could type it in. the arrows there why not leave it out so I can type it in, that’s just me.  We live in a rural area, very. I don’t see it so I’ll just pick one close to it. Primary phone number. Theres no alternate because he never answers his phone. I would put my phone number there, the veterans that are being helped don’t have a computer and don’t really use cell phones so I just put my number and email because I do the interacting.

* Medical care: this one would be helpful if it had prompts like the drop down. Theres so many and they change their names often. This one I would like to have the drop down because I can’t remember the name so I put the original and prey they find it. If it had beds it’s a hospital if it doesn’t it’s a clinic. I don’t think many people would know the difference in clinic or hospital I only know because I use to work in the hospital if theres no bed then it’s a clinic. I don’t even know why that matters.

* Additional information that would be helpful: If they are requesting the last treatment the only thing I think would be needed is the name, I don’t know why its asking hospital or clinic because if that’s where you got the care its where you got the care. It can go away. Then this one I don’t know why its here. Isnt that redundant didn’t we just answer that above.

* Take a guess why its there:  I am drawing a blank. I don’t know why me applying for caregivers care why would it matter where the care will be because it will be at home and not at a clinic. I cant even come up with a reason they may want it. if they are asking where I will be receiving care I don’t know why. I am sorry. I’ll just put the same but here it gives the drop down so why not have the drop down up top. This same one here should be up here as well.

* Step two: on this one I think yes but I would read learn more because I need to make sure before going through the 30 minute process. I would read the qualifications. Me I wonder the need help, is that on every page. I was just curious I just noticed it because I had nothing else to read.  I was just wondering why its there. Sometimes I go off on a tangent.

Now its asking for my information so I would put my information. I don’t know why they need my SSN. I don’t know if its for tracking but I would wonder why my SSN is important.

Want something that told you why: yes that would be useful because with identify theft if you don’t have to give the SSN most are like no. I don’t know why I am giving it so most people would stop especially older people

Would it stop you: If I were to have the information why they need it and what will happen with it, it would give me something to ponder. It depends on the explanation. It would depend on the reasoning why. With the VA because they have had so many breeches in the past I would be concerned. For my dad I would do it because the reason I am filling it out I would go ahead and do it because it is for him. If it were for anything else I would stop. 

They might need my street address for mail, I live with my farther 70 percent of the time and in Atlanta the other 30. So because I am there with him most of the time I would put his address. You are going to have I would say children caring for their parents that don’t live in the same house. For me I am a little different I live in two places. I would get information twice. Now my relationship, does this drop down work. Okay those would cover everyone.

Now with the primary care giver health coverage , why. I am not the one getting the care the veteran is getting care so I don’t know why they need my medical infomration. That would puzzle me, I am not applying for me, if I am getting a benefit or stipend that has nothing to do with me getting compensation. This question would bother me, I don’t understand why

If it had why and what its used for: that would be helpful yes.

No secondary caregiver. I would read who qualifies but I would wonder why it’s here because wouldn’t the secondary caregiver also, like I would be the caregiver, wouldn’t the same qualification apply for anyone else. Or is it the primary that’s this and the secondary have different requirements. Why is that there, I don’t know why its there. I would read it to be nosey but wonder why tis there because it should be the same as the primary.

* Anything particularly confusing for them? Nothing yet, its pretty basic.

**On the "Select who will sign for the Veteran today" page**

* How did you make your decision? Well my dad can sign because he is physically able to so I would have him come sign it. I filled it out but he will sign only because at 74 he may have health challenges but I try to give him as much independence to do what he can do.

* View: I wouldn’t go through to see it because I took my time and made sure I read it all the first time.  Okay enter veterans full name. Now it may not apply to many but my dads birth certificate has a different name then the va records. So sometimes we are like what name should we use. When he entered into the military his name on the birth certification are initials so when he got to MEPS they told him he needed a full name not initials so he gave himself James Charles. He was given a new name change kind of thing but it was done through the military. His birth certificate still had JC not James Charles so we have trouble because it doesn’t match. Maybe have enter veterans legal name so it will match. I don’t know how many have had that issue but we have that issue.

* In this case that it looked like this what would you do: we would put the military name due to it ebbing the military document. For SS we have to use JC but here we would put what the army gave him.

I should have read this earlier because it says  I will reside with eh veteran when I am the primary caregiver, it should have prompted me to read it so I can make the decision on if I want to do this. This is the first time I have read that I will need to live with them. It works for me because my dad comes with me and when I am gone my sister does the little part for me. some people have homes in different locations and actually moving in with eh person may not work for them but they are the only one able to care for the veteran. Requiring them to physically reside with he veteran is a bit much to require. Expecting me to give up everything is a bit much. That would trouble me a little bit and I would have liked to read that before going through the entire application to do it or not before getting to this part.

**Post task questions - 10 minutes**

·   	What did you think of the overall experience in completing this form? It was easy to follow. It wasn’t hard to navigate through at all, everything was there besides the drop downs I preferred. The questions are straightforward so theres no hidden agenda or trying to trap someone. The form was good and easy. Some of the questions I have mixed feelings and ask if its really worth it or whys it important or what good will it do. If you are doing a background check just tell me, don’t just ask for my information and not tell me. I don’t need to pull my credit and see a hit from the VA. that’s not fair to the applicant. Be upfront and don’t leave me wondering what you will do with the information. The ones that care about the loved ones will just bite the bullet even if you get a ding. We care about our family enough to just do it. signature, I would have wanted that in the beginning not to force me to click to read it to see if I qualify. Just put this at the front so I can see if I can do this. They always have thing about reading the privacy policy but no one reads it. the important things that effect people when dealing with veterans is the least number of things we need to dig for to look for the better. We sometimes in the military when I first got out I had to go to the doctor, civilian doctor instead of military. I go in and I don’t need to do anything and look for anything. Getting out of the military I have to do it all myself, we have been conditioned to just be there and we haven’t had to look before so we will miss a lot because we aren’t used to having to look for it. the more information out front is better for veterans. Instead of the privacy link, 90 percent of us wont read it. the things that can hurt us are things that will make use make a decision just put it on the side in blue or with an arrow saying this will happen. That right there helps us more so than you think it does because we aren’t used to looking for digging. In the privacy policy it could say if you do this you could eb charge, put it there because we all make mistakes. When I get the letter from the va I would ask how. Transparency is a thing. As far as the form itself it wasn’t too long, I was expecting. The one I got I had to fill out every va he’s used with primary doctors names, medical conditions.

·   	This one shorter: yes way shorter.

·   	Any time you need to sign for your father: Yes. If its his medical care or something with the va and he doesn’t need to do anything for or not involve finances then he will sign it. If it involves him having to sit and go through, if a=b and c=a then that’s to much for him. If its something simple and he can do this and I can sit on the side. If its something simple he can sign. On the outside when we do taxes for his property. Most veterans have homes and vehicles. We had to change over the deed of the property. So on those forms I needed to sign for him, I just let him initial it. That was my doing for his comfort but I have to sing it when it comes to finance decisions that when I sign because I am responsible to deal with the Leander or contractor getting the payment.

·   	Provide proof: yes

·   	What kind: I have his POA and general POA. Then I have the va form where they appointed me ad his fiduciary and we give those to them so they know I handle it. even though the general POA says I can do it all its just a comfort thing. I don’t want anyone to look at it like someone is trying to take something form my father so I provide all documents.

·   	Medical decision: it has a line in there but we have his will and his appointment for medical decisions. It’s a form the va had us do and get notarized for me to make medical decisions on his behalf. It’s a separate form and we had to turn it into the va so they have it on file as well.

·   	Would you legally feel like you could sign it if he’s not there: yes

·   	Confident here: I would be only because we have the forms on file with the va. that’s the only reason I would feel okay doing it because the va has it on file so there wont be kick back because it will link it to the authorization. Perhaps that question says you need to upload it, maybe it could have a list of documents that the va accepts it would help answer that question. I might think his general POA is enough but the va may require the form be filled out form them. That may be helpful there. If the veterans and the representative don’t have the right form perhaps it could be here where you can download it here and have the veteran sign it so that way they know for sure they have it.
