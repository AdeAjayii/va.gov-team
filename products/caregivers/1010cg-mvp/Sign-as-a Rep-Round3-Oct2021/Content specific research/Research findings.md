## Research Goals 

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Better understand Caregivers' mental model of the types of proof of legal representation they are accustomed to providing
- Better understand how Caregivers think about the nomenclatures of different types of legal representative documents
- Better understand Caregivers' familiarity of health care-specific legal documents
- Validate content comprehension of the list of documents to select from for document upload
- Validate that the new copy and flow leads to more accepted documents uploaded

## Research Methodology 

Mixed-method interview and mental model: open-ended questions, directed storytelling, provide ratings on a scale, and be asked to talk through mockups.


Tools: Zoom, [Mural](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1635267785345/2f0d4a4b46eb79c94cf93bcd0adb65ec8348554f?sender=u6ad375c1c8425e5bfec67027)

### Research Questions

The research questions we sought to address: 

- How do Caregivers know what type of proof to provide in any given situation that they will be signing on behalf of a Veteran?
- What is Caregivers' mental model of the different types of legal representative documents? (specifically those that have a health care stipulation)
- Does the updated copy and flow provide the information needed in order for the Caregiver to make a confident decision of how to answer the questions and what document to upload?
- Is that the correct decision (acceptable document is uploaded when relevant)?
- Does the question "Who will sign this application for the Veteran?" create a blocker because the Caregiver thinks that being a legal representative is a requirement for the Caregiver program?

## Key Findings

1. Participants believe that the legal representative documentation comes from the VA and thus a form number or link to the form or how to get it and/or example should be provided.
2. Participants think about legal representative documentation based on what it enables them to do (eg. make medical decisions) rather than the form name itself.
3. Often the ability for the Veteran to sign for themself/ make medical decisions or not depends on the day.
4. Participants wish that the text could be shorter and more precise.
     - Participants do like that "VA cannot accept these documents" list is provided
5. Participants believe that VA should be more proactive in patient planning in regards to programs and paperwork that should be considered in their future based on their current needs. 
6. Participants feel like the copy that states that there could be a delay/rejection due to wrong document upload is very negative.


## Details of Findings

### Participants believe that the legal representative documentation comes from the VA and thus a form number or link to the form or how to get it and/or example should be provided.
The majority of participants who have had to provide legal representative documentation obtained the forms through the VA. Some participants also went through a lawyer, but believe that VA paperwork is needed for the VA. Because participants think that in this section of the application the VA is requesting a VA form, they believe that there should be a form number or link to the form provided. Additionally, participants think that there should be directions on how to obtain the form for those that do not currently have it.

###  Participants think about legal representative documentation based on what it enables them to do (eg. make medical decisions) rather than the form name itself.
Many participants didn't know the exact name of their legal representative documents, but rather understood the different types of scenarios and what type of paperwork would be useful in a given situation. People think in the categories of: legal, financial, and medical. For some the title "Proof of legal authority to make decisions" was confusing because they were unsure if this is referring to legal or medical.

### Often the ability for the Veteran to sign for themself/ make medical decisions or not depends on the day.
A few participants were unsure of who would sign the application in their circumstance. They said that they usually try to involve the Veteran, but if they were having a day that they were unable to then the caregiver would sign on their behalf. These participants wanted assurance that if they signed this application, that it wouldn't take away the Veteran's privledges to sign and make decisions in the future. 


- “I wou

### Participants wish that the text could be shorter and more precise.
About half of the participants expressed that there was two much information given on each page, and would prefer is the language was more direct. 

- “It should say 1. Can the Veteran sign for themself? 2. If no, who is the legal representative? 3. Do you have legal proof? 4. What type of legal proof do you have?"

###  Participants believe that VA should be more proactive in patient planning in regards to programs and paperwork that should be considered in their future based on their current needs. 
Participants feel like they 

- "Seems like this is repetitive, as I already clicked the link to apply."
- *In regards to Primary Caregiver question:* "If you're having someone apply for caregiver, of course you are applying for the benefits. Why else apply or be recognized? *In regards to Secondary Family Caregiver:* "Maybe if there is a way to have Primary and Secondary together to explain the differences so I know right off the bat what I'm applying for. I don't know if everyone gets a Secondary Caregiver."
- *In regards to Secondary Family Caregiver:* "Is this for an additional Caregiver or am I called a Secondary Caregiver?" *Opened the more info accordion and seemed to understand the difference, but confused as to why this question is on the Primary Caregiver application:* "Maybe should have a second application for Secondary Caregiver."

### Participants feel like the copy that states that there could be a delay/rejection due to wrong document upload is very negative.
Participants don't feel like this copy would stop them from completing the application, but do feel like it leaves a negative impression. One participant thought that this language is the VA's way of keeping people out of the program.

## Additional Insights
* Many Caregivers live with the Veteran and/or use their contact information in place of the Veteran's, in the future it might be nice to consider having a checkbox to select the same address, phone, and email to avoid writing the same thing twice.

* Learn more about who qualifies as a Primary/Secondary Caregiver (additional info component)

    * The same people (relations) are listed for both Primary and Secondary, thus this does not help people understand the difference.

    * The list does not match the dropdown list that the user must use to select the relationship of Caregiver to Veteran.

* One participant expressed concern about the Social Security number showing fully on the Review page as she often uses public computers.
    * "I would close it (review accordion) immediately if I saw my Social Security number and address appear on the screen."

## Recommendations
* Implement upload documentation question into the workflow

* Add additional content/example to help users understand what qualifies as a legal representative document

* Explore more options for the signature page

In the future
* Keep the new language for Primary/Secondary Caregiver, but improve the user experience by rethinking both the structure and copy of the question pages, potentially combining them and adding additional information about what each role entails and what the benefits are for each.
* Consider putting medical facilities question on their own page or clarifying language about what is required or optional.

## Next Steps

* Upload page
  - Implement copy tweaks

* Explore options for the representative signature box
