# [DRAFT] Conversation Guide: VSA Caregiver, Mental model and Content-specific comprehension study for the 10-10CG document upload, November 2021

## Moderator Logistics

- _Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers._
- _Before the session, send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel)._
- _Make sure everyone except the participant and moderator are on mute._
- _In the Audio section, tap the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked._
- _Check your [screensharing setup]. Make sure they are setup on Zoom app and ready to screenshare._
- _When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro._

## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Dené and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we'd like to get to know more about your experiences being a legal representative of a Veteran.

- This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. 
- I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. 
- Please remember that this is not a test. We want to better understand your experiences, and there are no right or wrong answers.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.



**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the Cloud.*

- **I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?"** 

Great. Now we're really ready to begin!


## Initial legal representative questions - 5 minutes
- Tell me a little bit about yourself
- Tell me a bit about the relationship you have with the Veteran.
- Are you part of the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers?

- Tell me about a time when you needed to sign a document on behalf of the Veteran.
  - Did you have to provide any proof that you were their legal representative to be able to sign for them? What did you offer as proof?

_**Pay special attention to if Veteran legal guardianship, Veteran-related court order, Health care power of attorney, or something similar is mentioned**_

- How often are you asked to provide proof that you're the Veteran's legal representative?

Now, I'm going to share my screen. If at any time you cannot see the screen or it is unclear, please let me know.

**Start sharing screen [Mural board](https://app.mural.co/t/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/m/adhoccorporateworkspace2583/1635267785345/2f0d4a4b46eb79c94cf93bcd0adb65ec8348554f?sender=u6ad375c1c8425e5bfec67027)**
