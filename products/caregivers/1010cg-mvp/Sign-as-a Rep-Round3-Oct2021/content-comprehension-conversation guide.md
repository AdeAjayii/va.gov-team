## Project-Specific Setup and Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Dené and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we'd like to get to know more about your experiences being a legal representative of a Veteran.

- This entire session should take about 1 hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. 
- I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. 
- Please remember that this is not a test. We want to better understand your experiences, and there is no right or wrong answers.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.



**Recording Instructions**

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the Cloud.*
