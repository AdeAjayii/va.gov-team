# [DRAFT] Research Plan: VSA Caregiver, Representative and Primary Caregiver/Secondary for the 10-10CG form, October 2021

## Background

This study is being conducted by the VSA Caregiver team.	

The Caregiver team launched the digitized 10-10CG form October 1, 2020. Early in 2021 the team added functionality that allows a Veteran’s legal representative to be identified and documentation (e.g. health care power of attorney) to be optionally uploaded. There have been 3 iterations of this design.

Currently only ~35% of uploaded documents can be accepted and provide the necessary legal proof for a representative to sign on behalf of the Veteran. This causes pain points for both the staff in the field and for applicants.
- Pain point for CG team in the field that must process the applications, contact each applicant who uploads the wrong document, and possibly work through a new application with them

- Pain point for applicants as it could delay their application and create redundant work AKA filling out a whole new application

Our hypothesis for this problem is:
- Applicants think that uploading (any) document will help support their application

- There is currently a loss of connection that the purpose of uploading a document is to enable a legal representative to sign on behalf of the Veteran

### OCTO Objectives 

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Increase Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov Benefit use and enrollment, across all business lines
- Decrease time to successful complete and submit online transactions
- Decrease time to process online applications (vs. paper)

### How this research maps to the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)
- Getting out
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring 


## Goals

The goals of this user research study are to: 

- Validate the usability of the updated representative workflow.
- Validate if this new flow improves the percentage of acceptable documents. 
- Validate that this question will not cause applicants to drop-off

### Research questions

The research questions we want to address are: 

- Are participants uploading a document that can be legally accepted to give them the authority to sign this application on behalf of the Veteran?
- Are participants confused by any particular aspect of the representative workflow?
- Does the current representative workflow stop users from completing the form?

### Hypothesis: 
- Users will be able to navigate through the form relatively easily, but still might have confusion about what type of document is acceptable in this situation. 


## Methodology 

A task-based usability study will be conducted with a UXPin prototype, remotely with Zoom using the Perigean contract. 


## Participants and Recruitment

We would like to work with Perigean to recruit for 6-7 **fulfilled sessions**. Therefore, we request that 10 sessions be scheduled.  

**Must have for participants**

All participants must be yes to one of the following questions:

- Are you a caregiver to a Veteran?  (must recruit at least 4)

or

- Are you a Veteran who has a caregiver? (must recruit at least 2)

Answer must be yes for 2 participants: 

- Are you a Veteran’s legal representative? 
  - If confused, provide this explanation: A representative is a person who, under applicable law, has authority to act on behalf of the Veteran or who is legally vested with the responsibility or care of the Veteran. Being next of kin or being married to the veteran does not automatically constitute legal representation.

**Good to have for participants**

- At least 2 participants with a disability rating with a disability rating of 70% or greater and identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities (please note that the prototype is not accessible for assistive tech)
- 50% women, 50% men
- 50% people who identify as an ethnicity/race other Caucasian
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area


**Recruitment requirements**
 
- All must have a laptop/desktop and be willing to be complete the test on said laptop/desktop (the prototype is not accessible on mobile devices)
- Participants must be able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, and to share their screen through Zoom.


## Timeline 

**Desired Timeline: October 27 - 29th, 2021**

Session length: 45 minutes 

Please leave 15 minutes in between each session.

Notetaking: Please designate someone from Perigeon to take notes

## Past iteration reference

**Iteration 1**: "Are you filling out this application as a Veteran's legal representative?"

**Problem:** Caused some participants to quit application because they thought legal representation was a requirement for the CG program

**Iteration 2**: "Do you have a legal representative document you’d like to share with us?"

**Problem:** Many unacceptable documents are being uploaded

**Iteration 2.2**: Content updated
