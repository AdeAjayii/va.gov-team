# Initiative Brief : Typeahead 2.0 (WIP)
#### Overview


## Description
- Typeahead has successfully be added to the global search header where users are able to benefit from suggestions that align to the queries that they conduct. However this feature is only associated with the search input field in the header and not available in other locations such as the search results page, a search landing page, etc.  This initiative is focused on establishing a drop down component which can be leveraged in multiple locations as described below.

## Problem
* typeahead is only available to users in the global header
* dropdown implementation limits our ability to resolve accessibility feedback to address user needs

## Benefits
_Establishing a drop down comonent for typeahead will:_
* ensure we are not reliant on third party components such as downshift which limits our ability to address accessibility needs
* enable more complex rendering of acronymns
* facilitate universal typeahead for other search tools and locations across va.gov
