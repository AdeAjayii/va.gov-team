## Background
Starting in January 2023, Veterans filing claims for presumptive conditions that are PACT Act eligible are allowed to file a Supplemental Claim without including new evidence to prove service connection. To get a disability rating, Veterans must prove that their time in service caused their condition. For claims that fall under the PACT Act, we remove the burden of proof. Veterans with presumptive conditions can file a Supplemental Claim without providing new evidence for service connection.

This is the second study done for Supplemental Claims. The OCTO Objectives and Veteran Journey are not different from the initial study.

### OCTO Objectives
- [ ] Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
- [ ] Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome
- [ ] Increase the quality and reliability of VA services
### Veteran Journey
Since Veterans can file Supplemental Claims benefits with VA between 180 and 90 days before separating from the military, this work impacts the Veteran journey from serving, to getting out, and all the way to dying as survivors can also file Supplemental Claims on the Veteran’s behalf. This work especially maps to the taking care of myself part of the Veteran journey, as Supplemental Claims for disability compensation supports:
- Recognizing and addressing mental health needs
- Managing primary care and chronic health issues
- Maintaining my health

## Research Goals
1. Determine if the process of filing a PACT-eligible Supplemental Claim is clear and actionable.
2. Determine if the user can understand what presumptive conditions are, and what happens when they submit a claim without evidence.
3. Validate that users can successfully and confidently submit a claim with or without adding evidence.

## Methodology
We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on February 21 - March 1, 2023. Participants were asked to go through a hypothetical scenario where they were told that they have a presumptive condition covered by PACT, and could file a Supplemental Claim for their previously denied decision. We also tested an optional task where they could upload new evidence to their claim, after they’ve reached the evidence summary.

We opted to test with a [mobile prototype]() to focus on the ability to complete the form in a restricted screen space and to gauge the form length. Further usability on desktop screens is recommended.

## Hypothesis and Conclusions
- We believe that all Veterans will be able to confidently complete a Supplemental Claim. **Maybe True.**

_9 out of 10 rated the form experience 8 and above, but 6 out of 10 rated their confidence in their submission 8 and above. The lower ratings come from the lack of their lack of confidence in the review and not being able to explicitly say that they qualify under PACT._
- We believe Veterans will understand the decisions they need to make with the content presented to them. **Likely True.** 

_Participants understood the content presented to them in the introduction page, especially in the introduction box that highlighted the requirements for submitting a Supplemental Claim. They also understood what the PACT Act and presumptive conditions are. A few participants noted that the content was long, and would require multiple sessions to complete the form. All participants understood what each section of the evidence page allowed them to do, but a few struggled with going back to add evidence because they didn’t remember the sequence of evidence screens._
- We believe Veterans are more likely to achieve a favorable outcome by submitting a Supplemental Claim via this digital experience. **Maybe True.** 

_All of the participants understood that the Supplemental Claim was submitted, half of the participants wanted a separate method of notification (such as email or text) that confirms the receipt of the Intent to File and form. Participant confidence was also affected by previous experience with the process lowering their expectations that the claim would be processed successfully._

## Key Findings
1. Most participants had a clear understanding of the requirements for filing Supplemental Claims, and what presumptive conditions are.
2. A few participants were not able to locate the action link to file a Supplemental Claim in the unauthorized site wide introduction page.
3. Most participants tried to add evidence to their Supplemental Claims despite not needing to for presumptive conditions.
4. Most participants thought the ‘Edit’ link in the issue summary page and evidence summary page lets them perform an action different from what they actually do.
5. Half of the participants were confused by the Appeals Modernization Act, because they didn’t know what the old appeals process was, but still continued with the form.
6. Participants understood what the notice of evidence needed is, and more than half clicked the link to view the required external page before certifying.
7. A few participants experienced confusion when they reached the warning alert on the evidence summary page.
8. Half of the participants struggled with going back and adding evidence from the evidence summary page.
9. Most of the participants misunderstood the action for the ‘print this page’ button.
