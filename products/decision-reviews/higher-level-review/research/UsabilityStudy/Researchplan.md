# Research Plan for Claims and Appeals, HLR, Febr 01, 2020
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
This is a usability test of HLR (Higher Level Review) February 2022. 

Several changes have recently been made to the online HLR form. A comprehensive usability test with actual veterans is needed. 

If a Veteran disagree with VA’s decision, they can request to have a senior reviewer take a new look at their case. The reviewer will determine whether the decision can be changed based on a difference of opinion or an error. Veterans can request a HLR online here: https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/higher-level-review/

### OCTO Objectives 

Which [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme) does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

## Research Goals	
1. Understand the current user experience, what usability issues exist, including confusing or unclear content/copy. 
2. Is the flow easy to understand and do participants have all the info they need?
3. Do participants feel that an adequate amount of information is presented?
4. Can participants go through the flow by themselves, without blockers or problems? 

### Outcome
This is a post launch usability test that will relieve and correct any remaining usability issues or pain points.

### Research questions
What usability issues exist within the flow? 
Are participants able to successfully navigate to and through the form without assistance from the moderator? 
Is the content and copy clear and concise? 
Is there ambiguity or confusion experienced by the participants within any of the pages? 
Do the participants feel that they have all the information they need to complete the flow?

### Hypothesis
Veterans can easily go through the HLR flow without any confusion, frustration or blocks. 
Veterans can go through the flow without any assistance. 

## Method	
We will be conducting a remote, moderated usability study with approximately 8 Veterans (separated from active duty).
Allowing users to walk through the Form, on their own, in their own environment (at home) can help us detect usability issues.
We will test the online version of the HLR Form in staging: https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/higher-level-review/request-higher-level-review-form-20-0996/start
We will log into staging and give the veteran control of our computer so they can navigate the HLR form. 
We will use Zoom to conduct these sessions.
The sessions will include a short interview (3-5 min.) about their experience with VA.gov.
We will ask the participants to go through the HLR Form from its beginning to its end. 
We will ask participants to speak out loud as they move through the form, and probe for usability issues and relevant feedback. 
Pre-test interview questions will probe past experiences to unveil contextual details, key frustrations, and goals/purpose behind accessing the HLR form. [Write into conversation guide]

### Location
Remote through Zoom

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	
OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

### Recruitment approach
We will recruit using Perigean. 

### Recruitment criteria
8 Veterans for this study. We are used to no-shows, so Perigean will recruit 15 Veterans to get 8 Veterans to show up. If 8 Veterans have been interviewed for the usability test, the remaining will be cancelled.  

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
All Participants must be Veterans (separated from active duty). 
The participants must have heard about HLR  OR  have appealed a claims decision in VA before.  
Participants must be willing and able to use Zoom, locate and use the chat function in Zoom, the share screen function as well as be willing and able to take over the control of the moderators computer when asked to do this.
Participants should be able to verbally describe to the researcher what they are trying to accomplish, what they are experiencing, and what they are thinking, as they are interacting with VA.gov.

Secondary criteria / Would like to have: 




Consider including more participants who use other assistive technologies (AT) as well: specialized keyboards, switches, and hearing aids are examples of AT that may be generally included.

What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Pro tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
50% women, 50% men.
50% people who identify as an ethnicity/race other Caucasian.
A mix of educational background. 
A mix of tech experience / tech savviness.
At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55.
At least 1 participant without a college degree.

### Research sessions
What dates do you plan to do research? 

### Length of sessions
How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. 
Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 
Please request enough dates and time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). 
	
## Team Roles
