08-2023 Benefits CE Decision Reviews

## Background

Our team is working on the second version of the form, and iterating based on opportunities identified through evaluative research.

## Intake

- How does the intake team use the area of disagreement?
- If the user identifies their area of disagreement as 'something else', can the claim still be processed?
- How does the intake team process additional explanation provided on a separate sheet of paper?
  - How do those explanations typically look like?
  - Is there typically one explanation for the form, or does it depend on the issues submitted?

## Legal

- Deadline + contested claims, are the plain language modifications acceptable?
- Area of disagreement, are there examples of other areas of disagreement, and can we provide them?
- Board Review Options: What kind of clarifying information can we show Veterans? 
- Reason for extension: What is the definition of ‘good cause’ and are there examples we can provide?
