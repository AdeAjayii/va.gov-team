## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: 1 week
- Desired number of users: 5
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: Perigean
- How you'll conduct the testing: online
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: zoom call walkthrough

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: Staged Rollout (also known as unmoderated production testing)

### Do I need a staged rollout?

**Yes**



#### Exceptions

Right now, [feature toggles](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/platform/tools/feature-toggles/) are the primary tool VSP provides for facilitating staged rollout. If feature toggles don't work for your use case, you can request an exception from staged rollout in Staging Review.

| Feature type | Possible with feature toggles? |
| --- | --- |
| New feature in existing application | Yes |
| New application | Yes |
| Static content changes | Doable but tricky |
| URL redirects | No |

Other exceptions to this requirement can be approved by DEPO VSP leads.

### Planning

- Desired date range: _\[06/02/21 - 06/08/21\]_
- How will you make the product available in production while limiting the number of users who can find/access it: \[_lorem ipsum_\]
- What metrics-based criteria will you look at before advancing rollout to the next stage ("success criteria")?: error rate < 5%.
- Links to dashboard(s) showing "success criteria" metrics: _\[link here\]_

_The stages and number of users below are provided as example values recommended by VSP, but can be customized to your team's needs._

### Stage A: Canary

_Test a small population of users to make sure any obvious bugs / edge cases are caught._

#### Planning

- Length of time: 1 (_minimum 2 hours_)
- Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): 10% (

#### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- What UX changes (if any) are necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges?

### Stage B: moderate

_Test a larger population of users to make sure there are no issues exposed by larger usage patterns._

#### Planning

- Length of time: x (_minimum 1 day_)
- Percentage of Users (and roughly how many users do you expect this to be): 25% (x users)

#### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Metrics at this stage (per your "success criteria"): x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- What UX changes (if any) are necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges?

_More stages? Sure! If it makes sense for your product! Plan them out with the same structure as above._

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
