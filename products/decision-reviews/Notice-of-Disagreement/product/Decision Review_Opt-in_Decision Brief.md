# Decision Brief - Making sense of Decision Review Opt-in
## Situation
- Veterans may submit an appeal to VA if they disagree with the outcome of a claim 
- The legacy mechanism is called an “appeal”
- As a result of the Appeals Modernization Act (AMA)<sup>1</sup>, Veterans may now submit “Decision Reviews”
- Notice of Disagreement (NoD), or “Board Appeal," is one of three Decision Review pathways available.
- As VA transitions from the legacy appeal process to new decision review processes, Veterans _may_ have the choice to opt into the new process
- The opt in is dependent on the circumstances of the claim they’re requesting an appeal on.

## Complication(s)
- However, we have learned that Veterans are confused by being unable to distinguish between claims eligible for opt in vs. claims that are not. 
- As a result, they’re more likely to pick up the phone and call VA for additional help. 


## Question(s)
How might we help Veterans make a more informed decision about how they will request appeals?
