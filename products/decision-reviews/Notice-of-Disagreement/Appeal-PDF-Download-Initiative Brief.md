# Appeal PDF Download Initiative Brief

---

## Outcome Summary
> *Brief statement describing opportunity you're pursuing e.g. "Increase Use of Search Tools on VA.gov." Include measurable outcome (i.e. metric) you're trying to affect.*
* .

Today, when Veterans file an appeal on va.gov, there is no way for them to maintain a record of their submission. To increase Veteran trust of the reliability of our products, we want to provide the ability to download a PDF copy of a submitted appeal, so veterans can store it in their personal records.

## Problem
> *Describe the challenge / pain point you seek to address.:* 
* Usability and design, experimentation, testing conducted with Veterans indicates that most expect to be able to download a copy of their submitted claim for their records. During research, many veterans expressed difficulty maintaining personal records, and simultaneously expressed distrust of va.gov's website because of a fear of data loss. 
* The reason for Veteran distrust in VA.gov services frequently points to site performence and their past experiences with VA healthcare and previous claims. Many veterans expressed challenges getting access to their records and finding data that they expected the VA to keep on file. Others expressed challenges meeting deadlines due to lost correspondence letters or other communications that slipped through the cracks. Although the reasons vary across factors related and unrelated to va.gov, we believe we can improve trust by providing Veterans with a record they can keep.
* This initiative helps further OCTO-DE's goal of making the claimant experience better by ensuring that application and decision review workflows set clear expectations about the process.

## Desired User Outcomes
- As a Veteran, I want the ability to download a copy of my submitted appeal, so that I know my appeal was successfully submitted.
- As a Veteran, I want to know exactly what date and time I submitted my appeal, so that I can keep it in my personal records.
- As a Veteran, I want to know which issues I added to a claim, so I can keep track of what I've filed.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- As a Veteran, I do not want to be mislead when downloading a copy of my claim, such that I believe it was successfully submitted when it was not.
- As a Veteran, I do not want to mistake the copy of my claim for a paper version that I need to mail, which could cause longer development time due to duplicate filing.
  
## Desired Business Outcomes
