* In the Attendees section, ensure everyone except the participant is on mute.
* In the Participant “more” menu, make sure “Play Join and Leave Sound” is unchecked.
* Check your screen sharing setup and share permissions for participants.
* When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro.
## Intro (5 minutes)
Thanks for joining me today. My name is Ruben. I’m part of a team working on the portion of VA.gov used for submitting benefit decision appeals. 

To provide a little background on this conversation, we’re holding a series of conversations with Veterans who are in the process of considering or submitting a decision appeal. This is to get an understanding of your experience of this process and your needs as a claimant. 

Before we start, there are a few things I want to mention:
I have some colleagues in the waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. Perigean did ask for your consent to allow observers, but I wanted to confirm before we get going. Are you okay with letting them in for this session?
* If the participant does not consent, ask the observers to kindly leave the Zoom via Slack.
* If a participant consents, let other observers into the room and allow a short pause to say hello. Here are some other members from our website team - if you’d all like to say a quick hello. And now for those of you who just joined, if you could please turn off your cameras to save bandwidth, that would be great.

This entire session should take about one hour. To ensure we're able to address all the topics we're hoping to cover, I may occasionally prompt you with the next question to keep us on track.

During this session, we want to hear your open and honest opinions. Anything you share will be taken as feedback for the claims process and VA website. We're not here to evaluate you.

As you’ve been briefed by Perigean, we'll be reviewing a software prototype of a potential future version of the board appeal form to gather feedback from you.

Before we get started, I just wanted to mention a few additional things. During this conversation, if there's any reason you want to stop the session, please let me know. Likewise, if there are any topics or questions you prefer not to answer, let me know, and I can move the conversation along.  You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.

One last thing. Are you comfortable if I record the screen and audio as we talk today? We capture these recordings to ensure we're able to capture your opinions accurately. Recordings are deleted after we complete analysis, and none of the comments from the recordings will be attached to your name.
* If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
Start recording.
I have started recording. I’d like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up (5 minutes)
*Goal: Gather context about the participant's claim context and location in the appeal journey.*

Before we look at the website, I’d like to get a little background information from you:
* What do you typically use VA.gov for?
* Do you currently have a claim you're considering pursuing a decision review or appeal for? (They should)
* Can you currently share a little about your history with that particular claim or set of claims? When did you initially file?
* What's currently going on with your VA benefits claim?
* How far along are you in the process of deciding to pursue a decision review or appeal?
* How would you describe your familiarity with decision reviews or benefits appeals overall? 
  Have you gone through any decision reviews or appeals previously?
* What's informing the path you're thinking to pursue? 
  [ probe research, consulting peers and experts, support in approaching the decision review appeal ]
* How are you planning to file your appeal?

## [ Transition: Navigate to the Board Appeal Form (5 mins)] 
Let's transition to looking at some of our in-progress work on a potential future version of the board appeal form on VA.gov. I'll be sharing my screen. Once I do, you should be able to take control of my mouse cursor to explore. What we'll be looking at is a prototype, so not everything will work as it would usually, but hopefully, we'll be able to get some good input from you as we go.

Now, imagine that you've decided to move forward to pursue a board appeal. You navigate to VA.gov, log in, and land on a page that looks something like this.
Go ahead and navigate to where you'd file a board appeal.

*Guide participants to Board Appeal CTA from "**choosing a decision review option**" from the "more information" section in "**check claim or appeal status**" -OR- the Board Appeal CTA from the "Request a decision review or appeal" page from the main nav if participants have difficulty.*

## Task 1.  Review Form Instructions (10 mins)
*Goal: Evaluate if Veterans are able to orient around what's presented in instructional pages and how comprehensible and valuable the content is, identify gaps* 
#### Orientation and Comprehension
- Help me understand what you're seeing on this page. What do you think this page is for?
- How is the content on the page organized?
#### Content Value and Usefulness
- Is this content you would engage in typically? Why or why not?
  [Probe expectations, usefulness, gaps ]
	- Is this the kind of content you would expect to show up on a page like this?
	- From your perspective, how useful is the content presented on this page?
	- Anything you'd expect to see that you're not seeing? What's missing?
- From your perspective, how well does the content support validate confirming that this is the right decision review or appeal option for you?

**Comparison Proposed Version with the Original Version** 
Taking a pause from the prototype. I'd like you to take a look at these two versions.
- Which do you prefer and why?

Let's move on. Go ahead and continue.   
## [ Transition: Review Contact Information and Select Review Option (5 mins) ] 
*Note: Validate user comprehension of task list pattern. Form sections (contact information, review option, request extension) are not areas of focus for this study; capture any critical feedback and move on.*

## Task 2. Select Issues (5 Mins)
*Goal: Evaluate value in facilitating issue selection.*

* What do you think this section is about?
* For your claim, do you know which issues you want the VA to review or revisit? 
  How are you determining which issues are most relevant for a decision review or appeal?
  [ Listen for role of decision letters, probe as necessary ]

## Task 3. Select reason for disagreement (10 mins)
For the sake of this review, go ahead and select [ issue ] and continue.
* Walk me through what you're seeing on this page. I know you don't have the details you might need to determine what to select here, but I would be curious what you're thinking as you're looking at what's listed on this page.
  [ Listen for thought process in reviewing issue disagreement specifics, watch out for reactions to "other field", probe as necessary ]

Let's go ahead and move on. Select [option ] and continue.
## Task 4. Capture Additional Explanation and Review (5 mins)

**Capture Additional Explanation**
- Go ahead and take a look at what's on this page and help me understand what this section is about.

**Review**
- Help me understand what this page is for.
- Where do you expect to happen if you click on where it says edit?

## Wrap-up (8 mins)
Before we close I've just got a few additional questions before we wrap up.

**Closing Questions**
- What were your overall impressions of what you saw today?
- Today we looked at a few enhancements the board appeal form does not currently have. I wanted to have you weigh in on them. Between the revised instructional page, inclusion of issue details, enhanced navigation, and enhanced review page, stands to have the greatest impact in bolstering Veteran confidence with their appeal submission? Why?
	[ probe prioritization ]
	- What would you consider to be a "must have's"?
	- What would you consider to be "nice to have"?
	- Are there any enhancements you don't find to be useful?

**Recruiting Experience questions (optional)**
* We're taking a look at our process for finding Veterans to participate in these sessions.
   * Is there anything you'd want us to know about how that was for you?
* Before you joined the study, you had to answer a questionnaire to schedule a session:
   * How did you feel about the questions?

**Thank-You and Closing: 2 minutes**
Great, thank you so much. This has been really helpful. We appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us. Before we close, do you have any questions or last thoughts for me before we end the session?

## Emergency Exit
Out of questions: We have covered all the questions I have for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback. Despite ending early, you will be compensated for this session.

Blame technology: I am so sorry, but the website is unexpectedly not working properly. I apologize for the inconvenience and thank you for your time. Despite ending early, you will be compensated for this session.

Backup Moderator: This is best to practice beforehand, but can work if there is an emergency with the moderator. Appoint another team member who will be on the call as the backup moderator. You can say “for the next part of this session Gary/Ruben will moderate.” They should be prepared to jump in if something happens to you or you are not comfortable to finish the session.
