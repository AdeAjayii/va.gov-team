When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro

## Intro - 5 minutes

* Thanks for joining us today! My name is \[NAME\] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how you interact with your VA health care, including your experience with copayments if you get them.
* Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
* This entire session should take up to an hour. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
* In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We want to hear about your experience with VA health care to inform us as we bring copayments online. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
* During this session, we'll be doing two things:
  * First, I'll start by asking you a few questions about how you interact with VA health care. During this part of the session, I will ask you to share your screen so I can follow along with you. I can give you instructions on how to share your screen if you need them!
  * For the second half of the session, we'll be looking at some fake copayment statements similar to ones you might have previously received in the mail. We want to learn what parts of these statements work for you, and areas that could be improved. 
* If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
* Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
  * If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

\[Start recording.\]

* I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

* Tell me a little bit about how you currently use VA health care.
* Tell me about your past experiences with VA health care copayments.
* Do you also use private health insurance?
  * How do you decide when to use private vs. VA care?
* What sort of communications do you receive from the VA?
  * What would you change about how the VA contacts you?

## Interview (Wayfinding) - 20 minutes

* Let's say you've received a letter in the mail about money you owe to the VA, but you've misplaced it, what would you do?
* What would you do to find information about money you might owe the VA?
  * Is there some other way you'd prefer to find this information?
* (If they haven't mentioned one of the online formats) Let's imagine there's a place online where you can access this information. Tell me what that looks like for you. 
* MyHealtheVet
  * Talk to me about how you'd find that information
  * (If they mention logging in, ask if they'd be comfortable signing in)
  * (Redirect to VA.gov afterwards)
* eBenefits
  * Talk to me about how you'd find that information
  * (If they mention logging in, ask if they'd be comfortable signing in)
  * (Redirect to VA.gov afterwards)
* VA.gov 
  * What do you normally come to VA.gov for?
  * Talk to me about how you'd find that information
  * (If they mention logging in, ask if they'd be comfortable signing in)
  * What keywords are you expecting to see?
* Let's say you had an appointment at your local VA medical center and want to see the charges for your care. What would you do to find that information?
  * How does this experience compare finding information about money you owe to the VA?

**Things to watch for**

* Where do Veterans expect to interact with their VA copayments?
  * If on MHV or eBenefits, what would they be looking for and where do they expect to find it?
  * If on VA.gov, what would they be looking for and where do they expect to find it?
* How do Veterans conceptualize the mailed Veteran Patient Statements? As debts, bills, something else?
* Do Veterans expect to find their statements in their own area on VA.gov or among other VA debts/bills?
  * Does their expectation match their ideal?

## VPS Activity - 25 min

First, I ask you to imagine that you are the Veteran in the following scenario:

* You are a Veteran who went to a VA medical center in February for a routine checkup. In March, you went back to the VA medical center to hav a few routine tests done and you refilled your medication. Today, a couple weeks later, you received a piece of mail detailing your VA healthcare charges.
  * In a word or two, what would you call that piece of mail?
  * What do you expect that mail to include?
* Next, I'm going to share my screen with you. I've entered in all of the things you mentioned you'd expect to see. How does this order compare to how you'd expect it if it were on a piece of mail or a web page?
  * Awesome, thanks! 
* Now, I'm going to show you a fake copay statement. There are a few pages to this, so let me know if you need me to scroll to see those.

\[Show participant first letter in the sequence\]

* How familiar are you with this letter from the VA?
* What are/were your first impressions of this letter?
* Can you tell me what you owe, based on this letter?
  * What do you think "Previous Balance" means?
  * What do you think "Payments Received" means?
  * What do you think "New charges" means?
* When do you need to pay by?
  * How much do you need to pay by that date?
  * What do you think will happen if you don't pay by that date?
* What options do you have to resolve these copay charges?
* How do you use the description section, where they itemize your charges, if at all?
* What would you do if you received this exact piece of mail?

\[Show the participant a second letter, where there are no new charges\]

* So let's say you misplaced the letter from before and forgot to pay the bill. A month later, you receive this letter in the mail. 
* Can you tell me what's different about this statement compared to the last one we were looking at?
  * Why do you think that is?
* What do you think these letters could do better?

\[Go back to the prioritized expectations area\]

* Now that we've looked at these letters, I want to go back to where we prioritized information. Would you make any changes or additions?

**Things to watch for:**

* Where do Veterans struggle to interpret their Veteran Patient Statements?
* How do Veterans prioritize information on the statements?

## Post-Task Interview - 3 minutes

* If you could describe the documents we looked at today in a word or two, what would you say?
* Do you have any other thoughts on what we talked about today?
* Any questions for me?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans, so thank you for your time.

Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day.
