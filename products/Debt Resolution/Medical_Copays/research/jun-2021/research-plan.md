# Research Plan for Debt Resolution Team, Medical Copayments Usability

As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.

## Goals

### What product & team are you doing this research for?:

Debt Resolution Team's Medical Copays

### Background: 

Our team is working to bring VA medical copay bills (Veteran Patient Statements) to VA.gov. Currently, Veterans are able to access the last 6 months of their statements through AccessVA directly or by MyHealtheVet link to that tool. In our previous research study ([readout](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/Debt%20Resolution/Medical_Copays/research/apr-2021/readout.md#debt-portal-copayment-enhancement-veteran-research-readout)), we learned that Veterans do generally expect all money owed to the VA to be found in a central location. Due to the authenticated experience not being ready to accommodate a more expansive 'financial hub as was proposed, we are scaling the copayments MVP back to be a standalone tool very similar to the existing benefits [Debt Portal tool](https://staging.va.gov/manage-va-debt/).  

With this round of research, we are looking to test a lower-fidelity prototype to gauge our success in wayfinding and tool design.

### Research questions: 

What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?

* Are Veterans able to locate the new Copayments tool easily? 
* Do Veterans understand how to use the Copayments tool?
* Do Veterans understand their options for resolving their bills?

### Hypotheses: 

* Veterans will try to navigate to the copayment tool using search or by clicking through the health care quadrant. Veterans may find the link to the tool to be hidden.
* Veterans may

## Method

### What method of research are you planning?

Remote, moderated sessions conducted on Zoom

* Usability testing with a UXPin prototype

#### Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions?

* Usability testing will help us identify pain points with our IA and design hypotheses

#### Where are you planning to do your research? 

Online, through Zoom

#### What will you be testing? 

[UXPin Prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/361636c369f65453b4880d1445911c4d9b869349#/pages/139236640/simulate/sitemap?mode=i)

## Participants and Recruitment

### Participant criteria: 

What are you looking for in a participant?

#### Primary criteria / Must have:

* 15 participants (for a minimum of 8 completed sessions)
  * Participants must use VA health care (disqualify those that don't)
  * Up to 8 participants that pay for their copays
  * Up to 7 that do not pay for copays
    1. Up to 4 with a disability rating of 50% or higher
    2. Up to 4 with secondary insurance that covers copayment
    3. Any that have asked for financial assistance
* Participants must be comfortable with discussing their past experiences with VA Health Care copayments.
* Please screen participants based on these questions:
  * Which of the following describes you?
    1. I use VA health care and pay for copays (Qualify 9 participants)
    2. I use VA health care and do not pay for copays (proceed to next question)
    3. I do not use VA health care (Disqualify)
  * Why do you not pay for copayment charges? (Qualify 6 total)
    1. My disability rating is 50% or higher (Qualify up to 4)
    2. My secondary insurance covers my copayment (Qualify up to 4)
    3. I asked for financial assistance (Qualify if available)
    4. None of the above (Qualify if available)
* Please confirm participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session and they know how to screen share
* Note:
   * For this session, we are unable to include those who use assistive technology, such as screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver, and ChromeVox).

   * For this session, we are unable to include people with significant vision loss.

   * For this session, we are unable to include people who use magnification tools.

   * The prototype beinng testing is in UXPin; this study requires using the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Internet Explorer and Edge are not supported.

#### Secondary criteria / Would like to have

* At least 1 woman
* At least 1 person of color
* At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
* At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
* At least one person that has no college experience 
* At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
* At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area
* At least one participant that has identified cognitive impairments and/or functional disabilities. Examples of diagnoses that may align with this would be Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, and vertigo. Other conditions may be aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning challenges such as learning and problem-solving.
* At least one non-native English speaker

## When?

### Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 

(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.)

* Jun 9 - Jun 15

### When will the thing you are testing be ready?

### Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? 

(This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

* Up to 1 hour, 30 minute buffer between sessions

### Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? 

Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.).
