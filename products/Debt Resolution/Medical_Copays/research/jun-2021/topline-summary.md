This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

The goal of this document is:

* To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
* To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
* To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

**Most Veterans understood that the online tool card would lead them into a tool** 

_This is a component that was tested to propose adding to the experimental design system_ 

* 8 successfully found the CTA button in the card to navigate into the tool 
  * 2 were directed into the tool
  * 1 was unable to view the prototype due to technical difficulties
* Most read the card to see what they could do within the tool 

> "Like, any time I request prescriptions whenever I get a prescription and I have a copay I can use this tool to go in there to pay my copay instead of having to send it in the mail which would be handy" - P4

**There were various expectations about what could be accomplished within the tool** 

* Most expected to be able to view their copay balances and pay any copay bills they have 
* A couple Veterans expected to see their copay rates; one mentioned a copay calculator tool 
* A couple Veterans stated they wouldn't be able to use the tool because they don't pay copays; one participant who pays for prescriptions wondered if they'd be able to view those within the tool 

**The first thing Veterans noticed within the tool was the alert notifying them that a balance has been sent for collection** 

_This is a component that was tested as part of the experimental design system_

* Some clicked on the alert to read more while others moved on to looking at either their balance details or resolution options
* Of the 10 participants who viewed the prototype:
  * 9 understood what a referred charge was and how to resolve it
  * 1 understood they owed money but struggled to find information about how to resolve it 
* Multiple were interested in seeing the specific charges that were referred for collection 

> "I'd want a link to the collection statement that says what the original charges were, the interest was, and the late charges. I want to see everything laid out to see what they're charging $130.00 for." - P1

**Most Veterans understood that balances were split by VA facility**

* Some liked that balances were split by facility because they've either been to multiple VA facilities or they liked seeing what charges they owe to which facility 
* 1 initially didn't scroll down on the page far enough to see that there were balances for multiple facilities 
* 1 didn't initially notice the 'View bill details' link and wondered what he owed to each facility 
* 1 didn't like that balances were split by facility and expected to see a total balance that he could pay all at once 

> "I think that's a really good idea because in my own case I used a VA in \[state\] and I've used the \[state\] VA and at one point I had copays from both facilities. To be able to see all of those on one page would be really helpful." - P2

"I would hope they'd be shown in one location. I would pay that one location." - P9 

**Some Veterans experienced difficulties interacting with the 'balance details' page**

* Some struggled to find the balance due date
  * Veterans often looked for the due date around the charges and payments table; however, that information was at the top of the screen
* Most understood the facility's balance amount 
  * 1 participant was unsure and calculated the balance based on the table; they stated the balance was $360 instead of $300
* Most found the due date, however multiple were unsure what amount was due by that due date 

> "Uh, let's see here. (Scrolls down, scrolls back up) I wouldn't think you'd have to pay all of it in full. Well, if you can't pay it in full then you'd probably have to call to see if you could make a payment plan." - P4

**Veterans interacted with the charges and payments table in different ways** 

* Many said they would review the table to verify that the charges were correct
* A couple Veterans stated that the information in the table was complicated or jumbled
* Multiple expected the dates within the table to correspond to appointment dates 
* 1 thought the table's data correlated with one statement 

> "...to me it's like looking at a statement or transactions without having to open each statement, which is kind of nice. I like that only 6 are shown, because it would take forever to find a particular statement..." - P10

**Most Veterans understood resolution wizard, however it wasn't the method some used to find information about certain resolution options**

* Of those who were given a scenario to find information about requesting financial help:
  * 5 were able to successfully find the FSR within the wizard
  * 2 struggled to find the FSR using the wizard
  * 2 found the FSR via the link at the top of the page rather than by answering the wizard's questions
* A couple Veterans expressed interest in filling out the FSR online 
* Multiple found payment information on the 'balance details' page rather than by using the wizard 
  * 2 navigated back to the 'balance details' page from the wizard page to find this information
