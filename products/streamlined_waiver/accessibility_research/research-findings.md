## Research Goals
_First, set the context of this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey. Explain what a Veteran might do before and after using this tool. What moments does this tool live in? Are there moments that matter to keep in mind? What are Veteran’s familiarity with tools like this? (do they use tools like this, or is this something new).

_The Veteran Journey_

Debt can happen at any stage in [the Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) after the ‘Getting out’ stage. However, certain types of debt, such as Post-9/11 GI Bill debt, is more likely to occur at the ‘Finding something to do’ stage.

Other key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
    
-   Taking care of myself
    
-   Managing my declining health
    

This research also touches on aging and managing new needs for those that develop vision issues or blindness later in life.

_Research Goals_


1.  #### Understand accessibility of the non visual user experience of the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) forms and what improvements can be made (efficiency, auditory scannability, proficiency, flexibility)
    
2.  #### Understand how this form compares in contrast to mental models Veterans that use screen readers have with other forms
    
3.  #### Understand Veterans level of satisfaction with the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) form



## Research Questions

### GOAL 1: Understand accessibility of the non visual user experience of the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) forms and what improvements can be made (efficiency, auditory scannability, proficiency, flexibility)

### Navigation & Overall Experience

-   How do Veterans with visual limitations who use screen readers navigate through the form?
    
-   How easy or difficult is it to fill out the form with a screen reader?
    
-   Which area of the form would be most helpful for Veterans using screen readers to hear first when they tab?
    
-   Should it be: The header (step x of 7) or should it be the question they are being asked?
    
-   How do they experience error states?
    
-   Do participants know how to expand *additional information* sections? 
    
-   What is difficult to accomplish in this form, if anything?
    
-   How is the experience of signing the form?
    

### GOAL 2: Understand how this form compares in contrast to mental models Veterans that use screen readers have with other forms

### Comprehension

-   How is comprehension of the list loops from editing a section to the summary?
    
-   How clear is the transition from one section to the next of the form?
    


### GOAL 3: Understand Veterans level of satisfaction with the eFSR (Streamlined Waiver) form

### Satisfaction

-   How do Veterans that use screen readers feel about filling out the SW form? Does it meet their expectations? How can we improve their experience?
    

## Methodology

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_


## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

**Participant Baseline**

This sample of participants was varied in terms of the type of screen reader they were using (JAWS, VoiceOver, or Dolphin Guide) and their level of proficiency with screen readers. P5 completed the form up to the review page, p6 completed the entire form up to confirmation page, P8 got to the form until 'contact info' section, P9 only saw the Wizard and Intro page. P3 and P7 did not get past the sign in process (they were both using Dolphin Guide).

* 2 participants were using Dolphin Guide, 2 participants were using JAWS, 2 participants were using VoiceOver

* The 4 male participants have all been using screen readers for 10+ years, the 2 female participants have been using screen readers for 2-5 years. 4 participants reported being blind and 2 participants reported being visually impaired but not blind. 2 have had VA medical copay or overpayment debt in the past, and 4 have never had VA debt.

* P3 has been using Dolphin Guide and other types of screen readers since 2005-2006. Their method of navigation is through tabbing. P3 said they have a sighted helper that helps them fill out forms, and usually they need help filling out consent forms.

* P5 has been using JAWS and has been using screen readers for 25 years. They use their arrow keys to navigate through a form and the tab key to fill out a form.

* P6 has been using VoiceOver and stated they are more comfortable with VO on the phone than on Mac. They use VoiceOver only 20% of the time because they have peripheral vision. Stated VoiceOver differs between iPhone and Mac. They stated they use Adobe Acrobat to fill out forms (they like that they can download the form and it can read them the page).

* P7 was using Dolphin Guide on the phone, the only type of screen reader they have ever used. To navigate through a page:  "It comes up and the verbal part talks to me and tells me what it does and reads it off to me what is on the screen then I can speak back. That’s where I am having the issue. Its not getting my words back. Today I am having all kinds of trouble it seems."

* P8 has been using JAWS and stated they are 'fairly comfortable' using it and can do a variety of tasks with it (send emails, use excel spreadsheets). Said "I am not an expert but I can do it" and "learning to navigate is a continual learning process". Said they have a "system" to navigate pages and forms, they view heading lists and navigate by link. P8 had never visited the VA.gov website even though they go to the VA a lot.

* P9 has been using VoiceOver for 10 years and said they are "very comfortable" using it. Accomplishes tasks on desktop by keyboard and on the phone it's "swipe and touch gestures". The most recent form they filled out was for a VA Clinic which eventually they had to do over the phone because it wasn't completely accessible. Explains why:  "If it was yes or no it would read the question and it would say yes. It was a check box and the screen reader would say unchecked but there was no way to interact with the box to check it. Some sighted users could use the mouse to click and it would work but I couldn’t get it to work with my screen reader."
