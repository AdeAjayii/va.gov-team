This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered. 


**The goal of this document is:**

 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Initial Findings

_Add ~5-10 top of mind findings. Include quotes if they are available or particularly noteworthy. [Example top line summary.](https://portigal.com/reading-ahead-topline-summary/)_


**This Streamlined Waiver had a more positive reception than the Full FSR**

- This is in comparision to our [last study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/combined_fsr/research/enhanced_fsr/research-findings.md) which tested the full FSR path. The streamlined waiver tested in this current study was described as "easy" and "straightforward".

**Split reception on the condensed intro page versus the full intro page copy**

- In comparing a lean version with the full version of the intro, preference was equally split. The majority of participants skipped ahead on the intro page and we recommend removing the alert box that hides the intro page content and keeping both action links to minimize frustration or drop off.

**Overall Comprehension**

- The majority of participants understood the purpose of the form, with the exception of 2 participants: one who said she had suffered a stroke that affected her memory, and the other who did not understand the form.

**Confirmation Page and trust**

- For some participants, at first, there was positive reception when seeing the green checkmark and "You're eligible for a waiver". Then disappointment when reading the fine print. This is an active conversation between VA stakeholders and SMEs and the copy is not final yet. Based on what we tested, it's clear that an automatic decision is unfamiliar and surprising, and also would be very positive. While at the same time, some participants can't believe it since they haven't seen it done before. An email and a letter to confirm and prove this would be helpful. One participant expected automatic approval as she compared it to submitted a form for Travel Pay. As we saw in our last study, the term "waiver" was not understood by all participants.

**Transition page**

- Since the transition page was confusing for some participants, we recommend removing the "next steps" portion as part of the same alert as "skipping ahead" to minimize confusion, and separate different ideas.
