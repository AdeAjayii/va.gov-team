## Research Goals
### [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/sharing-research/research-findings-template.md#background)Background

The Streamlined Waiver allows Veterans who meet the qualifications to bypass sections of the Financial Status Report and automatically receive a waiver of their copays. [This Mural](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1678973946956?sender=ua78f969c4cddcbfe56b27885&key=340ed11b-aab8-42d3-b488-f9abf67b3513) with the different user flows will be the best way to understand all of the paths that users can take. We need to let users know that they may not have to fill out the full form and why they may have bypassed some questions if they meet the qualifications.

Simplifying the process for claiming medical debt forgiveness, VA will streamline the request process and set a simple income threshold for receiving medical debt relief. The request process will include an online option for veterans and reduce the effort required by veterans to access relief. These changes will go into effect this month.

The assumption is that transparency is important, the framing as well as the expectation setting for the streamlined waiver process will be key and contribute to a seamless and satisfying experience for Veterans seeking to resolve their debt. At the same time, our stakeholders have expressed concern that an upfront transparency reveal of the possibility of an automatic waiver could be confusing and upsetting for Veterans if they are deemed not to be eligible. **We also know that, currently, 95% of users with VHA debt (copay debt) will be approved for the automatic waiver.**

  

Continuing the [usability study we did in May 2023](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/combined_fsr/research/enhanced_fsr), the Streamlined Waiver usability study is an extension of this work. The Streamlined Waiver offers a revised intro page, offering limited copy in terms of transparency and offering clarity on the required sections the Veteran will be expected to fill out. Furthermore, the Streamlined Waiver will take the Veteran through a dynamic flow unique to their financial and life situation (income limits thresholds, number of dependents, spouse's information, cash on hand). Taking into account the length of the form and the fact that users skim content, we seek to make the form's content scannable and easily digestible.

Which  [OCTO priorities](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/strategy/OCTO-DE%20Priorities%202023.md)  does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.

This research supports these main [OCTO objectives and goals](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme):

-   Veterans can manage their health services online
-   Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
-   Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
    

This research supports increasing these measures:

-   Usage of digital, self-service tools
-   Percent of applications submitted online (vs. paper)
-   Completion rate of online transactions
-   Veteran satisfaction with VA.gov
-   Number of VA.gov users as a function of total Veteran population
-   Benefit value (in $) delivered from online applications or transactions

This research supports decreasing these measures:

-   Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution
-   Time to successful complete and submit online transactions
-  Time to process online applications (vs. paper)

Where does your product fit into the  [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Are there moments that matter?

  
Other key moments this research touches in the Veteran journey are:

-   Attending to health needs
-   Taking care of myself
-   Managing my declining health

**Usability study (40 minutes)**

**Test [User Flow for Dan](https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/departmentofveteransaffairs9999/1678973946956?sender=ua78f969c4cddcbfe56b27885&key=340ed11b-aab8-42d3-b488-f9abf67b3513)** (automatic approval flow under GMT)

**Areas being considered:**

-   **New copy (intro page, transition page, confirmation/decision page)**
    
-   **Transition page and progress bar**
    
-   **Review page**
    
-   **Submission confirmation page and automatic waiver decision** (only surfaced if they are approved)
    

***Goal 1: Evaluate the usability of the Streamlined Waiver experience***
Minimize confusion with a “skipped question” transition page

***Goal 2: Evaluate the comprehension of the Streamlined Waiver experience and the new copy additions to the FSR/Streamlined Waiver pages.***

Clarity, and define expectations early to minimize cognitive burden

***Goal 3: Evaluate Veterans trust, and subjective experience of FSR/Streamlined Waiver. Has it changed?***

**Concept test (10 minutes)**

In the last 10 minutes of the usability study interviews, we will do a small concept evaluation in which we seek to understand whether Veterans prefer a lean intro page in terms of copy, or a more extensive intro page. We will prevent both side by side. Where can we backfill content, or cut out redundant content?




## Research Questions


1. What do Veterans understand about the FSR form at the intro, as they progress through the form, and at the end of the form?
    
2.  Is it clear from the revised intro page what information they need to provide?
    
3. What is their level of trust through this process and experience? Is it any different from the FSR and eFSR?
    
4.  How do Veterans with medical copay debt understand “Help with your debt” without upfront reveal of the possible outcomes repeated throughout the form (waiver, automatic waiver, or payment plan)
    
* Is the mention of “Help with your debt” only enough to motivate the Veteran to fill out the form? How do Veterans perceive this Help could look like? Does it matter to them?
    
* There is a trade-off, in terms of providing just enough information, so as not to overwhelm Veterans filling out the form, while also being comprehensive.
 
5. What is their level of confidence in the process?
    
6. How do they understand the “Cash in hand” question? What do they understand “Cash in hand” to mean? How clear or unclear is this question?
    
7. How do they feel about the transition between the last section (cash on hand question) and the transition page? How clear is this transition?
    
8. How do they feel about the review page?
    
9. How do they feel about the confirmation page? Is there anything else they would wish to see on this page?

**Concept Evaluation**
- Between the brief intro page and the extensive intro page, which we will show them side by side, which one do they feel is most helpful? Why? 

## Methodology 


-   Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
-   Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
-   The sessions will be remote moderated interviews on Zoom.


## Hypotheses and Conclusions


**We hypothesize that:**

-   The revised intro page will be clear
    
-   The form flow will be clear and easy to understand
    
-   The transition page will make sense
    
-   The submission page notification with the reveal of an automatic approval will be well received and maybe even positively surprising.

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_


## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)_

1. **This Streamlined Waiver had a more positive reception than the Full FSR.**
>This is in comparison to our last study which tested the full FSR path. 
>The streamlined waiver tested in this current study was described as "easy" and "straightforward".


2. **Overall Comprehension**
>The majority of participants understood the purpose of the form, with the exception of 2 participants: one who said she had suffered a stroke that affected her memory, and the other who did not understand the form in the beginning, possibly due to cognitive considerations.


3. **Split reception on the condensed intro page versus the full intro page copy**
>In comparing a lean version with the full version of the intro, preference was equally split. Half of the sample of participants preferred the extra information provided on the full introduction explaining each category (example: what are considered assets) to help them prepare, while the other half preferred to see all of the categories grouped together to easily scan visually. 
>The majority of participants skipped ahead on the intro page and we recommend removing the alert box that hides the intro page content when viewing on mobile, and keeping both action links to minimize frustration or drop off. 



4. **The cash on hand question was easily understood by all participants**
>Participants easily understood the "Cash on hand" question. Specifically, the information in parentheses (“cash not in a bank”) is what helped participants understand the meaning of cash on hand. 

5. **Transition page clarity**
>Since the transition page was confusing for some participants, we recommend removing the "next steps" portion as part of the same alert as "skipping ahead" to minimize confusion, and separate different ideas.


6. **Confirmation page and trust**
>Most participants were positively surprised by the immediate feedback on the decision of their request. 
>For some participants, at first, there was positive reception when seeing the green checkmark and "You're eligible for a waiver". Then, some felt  disappointment when reading the fine print. 
>Context: This is an active conversation between VA stakeholders and SMEs and the copy is not final yet. 
>Based on what we tested, it's clear that an automatic decision is unfamiliar and surprising, and also would be very positive. 
>While at the same time, some participants can't believe it since they haven't seen it done before. 
>An email and a letter to confirm and prove this would be helpful. 
>One participant expected automatic approval as she compared it to submitting a form for Travel Pay. As we saw in our last study, the term "waiver" was not understood by all participants.
