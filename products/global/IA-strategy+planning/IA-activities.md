# Information architecture activities 

### The problem we're trying to solve:
We have not had the resources to focus on how things are organized **across the whole veteran experience.** Information architecture (IA), content, and design need to work together. Any time a veteran interacts with the VA, it should be seamless.

### We’re figuring out where to begin IA work.

* Step 1: Evaluate the **overall health of VA.gov’s information architecture** using:  
  * baseline testing of top tasks;
  * analytics; and
  * an expert review.

* Step 2: Recommend:
  * where to begin IA work based on the evaluation (see above); and
  * how we can help.

* Then we’ll prioritize IA projects with the team:
  * Where do they think users struggle?
  * What projects need IA help the most?
  * What are other considerations? 


### We’re setting up space for discussion and sharing about IA.

* **Potential projects:** See the [IA planning roadmap](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/IA-planning_5-29-2020.pdf). (Download it for easier reading.)
* **Slack:** We'll use the **#ia-forum** channel.
* **Meetings:** Every 2 weeks we'll share what we're doing and learning, get feedback, and discuss next steps.

### We’ll define the IA role and responsibilities and ways to work across teams.

* We’ll "workshop" the IA role and responsibilities July 20. At that time, we'd also like to discuss:
  * Who does which work? (DEPO v. Platform)
  * How do we bridge between DEPO and Platform?
  * How do we balance current and future needs?
  
* And we’ll continue discussions we’re already having with content, visual design, and product about the best ways to work together.
  * How do we identify projects that need IA early on?
  * What's the workflow?
