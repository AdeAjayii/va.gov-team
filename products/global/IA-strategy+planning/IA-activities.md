# Information architecture activities 

### The problem we're trying to solve:
We have not had the resources to focus on how things are organized **across the whole veteran experience.** Information architecture (IA), content, and design need to work together. Any time a veteran interacts with the VA, it should be seamless.

### We’re figuring out where to begin IA work.

* We’ll start by evaluating the **overall health of VA.gov’s IA** using:  
  * baseline testing of top tasks;
  * analytics; and
  * an expert review.

* Next we’ll recommend:
  * where to begin IA work based on the evaluation; and
  * how we can help.

* Then we’ll prioritize IA projects with the team:
  * Where do they think users struggle?
  * What projects need IA help the most?
  * What are other considerations? 


### We’re setting up space for sharing and conversation about IA.

* For potential IA projects, see the [IA planning roadmap.] (https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/IA-planning_5-29-2020.pdf)
