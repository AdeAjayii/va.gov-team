# Information architecture activities 

### The problem we're trying to solve:
We have not had the resources to focus on how things are organized **across the whole veteran experience.** Information architecture (IA), content, and design need to work together. Any time a veteran interacts with the VA, it should be seamless.

### We’re figuring out where to begin IA work.

* Step 1: Evaluate the **overall health of VA.gov’s information architecture** using:  
  * baseline testing of top tasks;
  * analytics; and
  * an expert review.

* Step 2: Recommend where to begin IA work based on the evaluation (see above), and show how we can help.

* Step 3: Work with the **#ia-forum** to prioritize IA projects:
  * Where do they think users struggle?
  * What projects need IA help the most?
  * What are other considerations? 


### We’re setting up space for discussion and sharing about IA.

* **Potential projects:** See the [IA planning roadmap](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/IA-planning_5-29-2020.pdf). (Download it for easier reading.)
* **Slack:** Post ideas, input, and examples to the **#ia-forum** channel.
* **Meetings:** Join us every 2 weeks to hear we're doing and learning, give feedback, and discuss next steps.

### We’ll define the IA role and ways to work across teams.

* **IA role and responsibilities:** The IA workshop kicks off July 20. As part of it, we'd like to discuss:
  * Who does which IA work? (DEPO v. Platform)
  * How do we bridge between DEPO and Platform?
  * How do we balance current and future IA needs?
  
* **Best ways to work together:** Let's the talks already underway and think about:
  * How do we identify projects that need IA early on?
  * What's the workflow between product, content, IA, visual design, and dev (Drupal)?
