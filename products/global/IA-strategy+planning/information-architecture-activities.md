# Information architecture activities 

### The problem we're trying to solve:
The VA.gov team has not had the resources to focus on how things are organized **across the whole veteran experience.** Information architecture (IA), content, and design need to work together on **everything.** 

Any interaction a veteran has with the VA should be seamless.
<br></br>
### Who's involved?
For IA strategy and planning, the information architects work with the **#ia-forum,** made up of DEPO leads, product owners, content strategists, and designers. **The information architects are:**
* DEPO: [Meg Peters](https://github.com/mpeterz)
* Platform: [Mikki Northius](https://github.com/mnorthuis)
<br></br>
### Steps we're taking.

**STEP 1: 
Evaluating the health of VA.gov’s information architecture.** 

We'll focus on wayfinding and how users navigate the site on both mobile and desktop, whether they are signed in or not. We'll find out things like:
  * How well can veterans do important tasks?
  * Where do they struggle? 
  * How can we make improvements? 
  * By doing certain things, have we improved the site or not? 

**We plan to regularly test the IA health of VA.gov and compare results over time.** To do this, we'll set up a repeatable framework of quantitative and qualitative measures, including: 
  * baseline testing of top tasks;
  * [Google Analytics for top tasks and mobile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/analytics/top-task-analytics.md); 
  * search metrics; and
  * an expert review of VA.gov.

**STEP 2: 
Recommending specific IA work based on these regular evaluations ^ of VA.gov.**
And showing how we can help.

**STEP 3: 
Working with the #ia-forum to prioritize IA projects:**
  * Where do they think users struggle?
  * What projects need IA help the most?
  * What are other considerations? 
<br></br>
### We're also setting up space for discussion and sharing about IA.

* **Potential projects:** See the [latest IA planning roadmap](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/IA-planning-roadmap.pdf) for projects that involve IA. (Download it for easier reading.)
* **Slack:** Members, please post ideas, input, and examples to the **#ia-forum** channel!
* **Meetings:** 
  * June 17 we gave a [presentation on IA planning](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/IA-at-VA-v2.pptx) in the biweekly VA.gov platform review for DEPO/CTO staff. 
  * June 24 at 12:30pm we'll discuss our plan for IA work and get your feedback. If there's time, we'll walk through the [IA planning roadmap](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/IA-planning-roadmap.pdf). 
<br></br>
### Soon we’ll define the IA role, responsibilities, and the best ways to work across teams.

* **IA role and responsibilities:** The IA workshop will kick off June 29. There we'd like to discuss:
  * Who does which IA work? (DEPO v. Platform)
  * How do we bridge between DEPO and Platform?
  * How do we balance current and future IA needs?
  
* **Best ways to work together:** Let's continue the talks already underway and think about:
  * How do we identify projects that need IA early on?
  * What's the workflow between product, content, IA, visual design, and dev (Drupal)?
