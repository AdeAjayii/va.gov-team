# Information architecture activities 

### The problem we're trying to solve:
The VA.gov team has not had the resources to focus on how things are organized **across the whole veteran experience.** Information architecture (IA), content, and design need to work together on **everything.** 

Any interaction a veteran has with the VA should be seamless.
<br></br>
### Who's involved?
For IA strategy and planning, the information architects work with the **#ia-forum,** made up of DEPO leads, product owners, content strategists, and designers. **The information architects are:**
* DEPO: [Meg Peters](https://github.com/mpeterz)
* Platform: [Mikki Northius](https://github.com/mnorthuis)
<br></br>
### Steps we're taking.

**Step 1: Evaluating the health of VA.gov’s information architecture.** 

We'll focus on wayfinding and how users navigate the site on both mobile and desktop, whether they are signed in or not. We'll find out things like:
  * How well can veterans do important tasks?
  * Where do they struggle? 
  * How can we make improvements? 
  * By doing certain things, have we improved the site or not? 

We plan to regularly test the IA health of VA.gov and compare results over time. To do this, we'll set up a repeatable framework of quantitative and qualitative measures, including: 
  * baseline testing of top tasks;
  * [Google Analytics for top tasks and mobile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/analytics/top-task-analytics.md); 
  * search metrics; and
  * an expert review of VA.gov.

**Step 2: Recommending specific IA work based on these regular evaluations ^ of VA.gov, and show how we can help.**

**Step 3: Working with the #ia-forum to prioritize IA projects:**
  * Where do they think users struggle?
  * What projects need IA help the most?
  * What are other considerations? 
<br></br>
### We're also setting up space for discussion and sharing about IA.

* **Potential projects:** See the [IA planning roadmap](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/IA-planning_6-5-2020.pdf) for projects that involve IA. (Download it for easier reading.)
* **Slack:** Members, please post ideas, input, and examples to the **#ia-forum** channel!
* **Meetings:** We'll start the conversation about IA strategy in the new DEPO product sync breakout meeting Wednesday, June 17 at noon. There we'll discuss next steps for sharing, getting feedback, and setting direction.
<br></br>
### Soon we’ll define the IA role, responsibilities, and the best ways to work across teams.

* **IA role and responsibilities:** The IA workshop will kick off June 29. There we'd like to discuss:
  * Who does which IA work? (DEPO v. Platform)
  * How do we bridge between DEPO and Platform?
  * How do we balance current and future IA needs?
  
* **Best ways to work together:** Let's continue the talks already underway and think about:
  * How do we identify projects that need IA early on?
  * What's the workflow between product, content, IA, visual design, and dev (Drupal)?
