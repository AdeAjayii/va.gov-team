# Information architecture activities 

### The problem we're trying to solve:
The VA.gov team has not had the resources to focus on how things are organized **across the whole veteran experience.** Information architecture (IA), content, and design need to work together. Any time a veteran interacts with the VA, it should be seamless.

For IA strategy and planning, the information architects work with the **#ia-forum,** made up of DEPO leads, product owners, content strategists, and designers. **The information architects are:**
* DEPO: [Meg Peters](https://github.com/mpeterz)
* Platform: [Mikki Northius](https://github.com/mnorthuis)
<br></br>
### First we’re evaluating and planning.

* **Step 1:** Evaluate the health of VA.gov’s information architecture by **focusing on wayfinding and how users navigate our site, whether they are signed in or not.** We're planning:  
  * baseline testing of top tasks;
  * [analytics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/analytics/top-task-analytics.md) (already underway); and
  * an expert review.

* **Step 2:** Recommend where to begin IA work based on the evaluation (see above), and show how we can help.

* **Step 3:** Work with the **#ia-forum** to prioritize IA projects:
  * Where do they think users struggle?
  * What projects need IA help the most?
  * What are other considerations? 
<br></br>
### And we’re setting up space for discussion and sharing about IA.

* **Potential projects:** See the [IA planning roadmap](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/global/IA-strategy%2Bplanning/IA-planning_6-5-2020.pdf) for projects that involve IA. (Download it for easier reading.)
* **Slack:** Members can post ideas, input, and examples to the **#ia-forum** channel.
* **Meetings:** We'll start the conversation about IA strategy in the new DEPO product sync breakout meeting on Wednesday, June 17. There we'll decide on next steps for sharing what we're doing and learning, getting feedback, and setting direction.
<br></br>
### Soon we’ll define the IA role, responsibilities, and the best ways to work across teams.

* **IA role and responsibilities:** The IA workshop will kick off June 29. As part of it, we'd like to discuss:
  * Who does which IA work? (DEPO v. Platform)
  * How do we bridge between DEPO and Platform?
  * How do we balance current and future IA needs?
  
* **Best ways to work together:** Let's continue the talks already underway, thinking about:
  * How do we identify projects that need IA early on?
  * What's the workflow between product, content, IA, visual design, and dev (Drupal)?
