# Top task analytics 

### The problem we're trying to solve:
The VA.gov team has not had the resources to focus on how things are organized **across the whole veteran experience.** Information architecture (IA), content, and design need to work together. Any time a veteran interacts with the VA, it should be seamless.

For IA strategy and planning, the information architects work with the **#ia-forum,** 8 people from DEPO (leads, product owners, content strategists, and designers). **The information architects are:**
* DEPO: [Meg Peters](https://github.com/mpeterz)
* Platform: [Mikki Northius](https://github.com/mnorthuis)
<br></br>
### First we’re evaluating and planning.

* **Step 1:** Evaluate the **overall health of VA.gov’s information architecture** using:  
  * baseline testing of top tasks;
  * analytics; and
  * an expert review.
