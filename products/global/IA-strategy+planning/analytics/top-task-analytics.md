# Top task analytics 

What do people do on VA.gov? To find out, we're using Google Analytics as a starting point.

One caveat to the numbers below is that sessions expire after 30 minutes. So users may have visited the site, done nothing for 30+ minutes, then resumed, which counts as a new session.
