# Top task analytics 

**Our goal is to find the top tasks people people do on VA.gov.** 

Once we know this, we plan to baseline test these top tasks with veterans regularly. Over time, this will show us whether updates to IA, design, and content are making it easier for veterans to use VA.gov on both desktop and mobile devices.

One caveat to the numbers below is that sessions expire after 30 minutes. So users may have visited the site, done nothing for 30+ minutes, then resumed —- and that counts as a new session.

### Top 25 pages for all VA websites
This [page views report for June 3, 2019 to June 3, 2020](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/_u.date00=20190603&_u.date01=20200603&explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&explorer-table.rowCount=5000&explorer-segmentExplorer.segmentId=analytics.pageTitle/) shows users of going to VA.gov, MyHealtheVet, and eBenefits. 

Because of the limitations and quirks of Google Analytics, the "pages" below are actually groups of pages represented by pages with the same < title > tag. For this reason, we did not combine items that are part of the same task. (Example: On MyHealtheVet, we would normally consider secure messaging and compose message parts of the same task.)

Pages with "Veterans Affairs" in the title are on VA.gov.
