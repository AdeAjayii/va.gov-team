# Discharge Upgrade Wizard 2021 Content Updates - Meetings and Decisions

## 2021-05-20 Meeting with Kayla Williams regarding content updates

### Attendees
- John Hashimoto
- Marci McGuire
- Kayla Williams

### Pre-Meeting Notes
- Bug I observed - the drop-down does not have 1992 as an option. Pre-1992 is there, but not 1992 itself.
- How it works - different sections of content are shown based on the user's answers.
- Content logic documented at https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/veteran-military-records/discharge-update/dw-content.md
- Mapping out logic in Mural: https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1621532440874/8a3ee02c63bf5216b24fb01025e1e109b43d5407

### Meeting Notes
- One thing Kayla heard from DOD - it may be easier to just create links to each of their portals
- Introductions
- John gave some quick background on the tool
- Kayla currently doesn't have much more than she sent John earlier
- Before they launch a campaign to drive more people to it, they realized that the content was outdated
- We may need to change the content to point people to their portals
- John advised that Kayla could put us in touch with the person she's been in contact with
- Do we elimate the instructions, PDFs? We'll find out from DOD and walk through that with this person
- At this point, the tool may be superflous to what the agencies are doing now
- If we can't fix the current upgrade page by June 1, should we do something else? Send them to the landing page with "Click here to explore the process..."
