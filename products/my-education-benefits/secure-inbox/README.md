# Secure Inbox (for education benefits)

## Background
### Problem Statement
GI Bill students may need to interact with a few different stakeholder groups when applying for eligibility and using their education benefits from VA. Some interactions require sharing documents that contain personal and/or sensitive information about the student, their eligibility, or the benefits they are receiving.

Today, students receive letters regarding their education benefits through standard u.s. mail. With the MVP release of the enhanced 1990 form in December 2021, we plan to provide access to eligibility and denial letters through the current Download VA Letters page on VA.gov (https://www.va.gov/records/download-va-letters/) in addition to u.s. mail (which is still a requirement). For any follow-ups, or supporting documentation that the student needs to provide to VA, the student needs to send the documents through mail or upload the document through the ask a question feature on the GI Bill help portal: https://gibill.custhelp.va.gov/app/home. VA staff reviews incoming messages and associates any documents with the student's account.

There are also interactions between a school certifying official and a student that happen offline or over email that could be useful to associate with the student's VA account so that there is transparency between the student, school, and VA regarding the student's education benefits.

### Proposed solution
The purpose of the Secure Inbox (for education benefits) is to provide a tool that is integrated within the VA.gov account for the user to access important documents and communications with VA and school staff securely. 

- Provide access to documents and messages from and to VA staff and school certifying officials
- Assess the existing health care secure messaging to see if it can be iterated or expanded to be used for the education benefit use cases.
- Assess the current benefit letters provided through the Download VA Letters page (besides education letters) to ensure they can be provided through a new inbox.
- Work with authenticated experience team to see if and where a global secure inbox could be located within a user's VA.gov account or if it should remain education benefit specific at this point.
- Explore how secure inbox can be used to enhance the security of communications sent to GI Bill students
- Explore how secure inbox interacts with other support channels provided through VA.gov
