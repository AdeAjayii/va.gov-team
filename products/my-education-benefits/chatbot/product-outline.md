# Chatbot (for education benefits)

## Background
### Problem Statement
GI Bill students have a few current avenues for support when researching and applying for different benefits: content on VA.gov, Ask VA, information from their school certifying official (or other school rep), and the Education Call Center (ECC).

None of these provide real-time support and guidance.

From August 2020 - August 2021 over 1 million calls were received by the call center; 70% of those calls were related to benefit/claim status or payment status.

Having a real-time channel for answering simple questions around education benefits would likely result in a massive reducation of volume to the call center. This would improve customer satisfaction by reducing wait times and likely reduce operating costs as well.

### Proposed solution
The purpose of the Chatbot (for education benefits) is to provide a tool that is integrated within VA.gov for the user to get quick answers to simple questions about their benefits and eligibility. 

Priority use cases:
- Provide access to certificate of eligibility
- Explain how to apply for education benefits 
- Allow users to learn more about the next step in their journey of applying for or receiving benefits
- Information about payments
- Application status
- Explore eligibility for different benefits
- Allow users to see recent or upcoming actions for students
