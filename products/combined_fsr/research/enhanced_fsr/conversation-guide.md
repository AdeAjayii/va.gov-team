Thank you for joining us today!

My name is Charlotte and Megan is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

**Today we're going to talk about your experience with a form called the Financial Status Report Form (FSR). This was previously a paper form you had to fill out by hand that has been made digital.**

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take about [**1 hour**]. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
    
-   **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability.** We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
    
-   **You'll be interacting with the live version once you login, which is fully clickable.** Please remember not to submit the form at the end, and I will also remind you. Since you will not be submitting the form, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
    
**-   If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
    
-   **I want to let you know that I will not be able to answer any questions** about the prototype or the form because we are interested in your unbiased opinions about them. If we have time remaining at the end of the session, you can ask me then.
    
-   **Finally, we ask that you turn on your video for our meeting,** if you are comfortable. If not, please let me know. 
    
-   Perigean did ask for your **consent to allow observers**, but I want to be sure before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
    
-   If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
    
-   If yes: Admit observers.
    
-   Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. **(This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant)**
    
-   Once complete ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for remainder of the session to save bandwidth

-   **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
    
-   If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.
    

Start recording.

**-   I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen, the video, and the audio as we talk today?**

    > Enabling for account, do they need to have debt in order to turn on the FSR?
they will need either an unpaid overpayment (debt) OR an unpaid copay bill (copay needs to be within past 6 months

Before we look at the form, let’s start with a few warm-up questions so that I can get to know you.

Background about their service history
-   If you’re comfortable sharing, could you please tell me briefly about the major parts of your service? (optional question)
   
  VA debt experience baseline
-   Are you currently employed, and if so, what type of work do you do?  
-   What has been your past experience with VA debt? [establish baseline]
-   What are your hopes for the process of getting help with this debt? Why? [establish hopes/desires]
-   What are your expectations? [establish expectations]


## [](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/conversation-guide-template.md#first-task-task-name---x-minutes)Scenario and Overall Task: 
Imagine you have some VA debt that you would like help with.

We are going to go through a form and ask you to fill it out, as you would normally. I am going to observe silently, and I will ask you questions at certain times. Also, I will ask you to pause at certain sections and I will ask you follow up questions.

Remember, there are no right or wrong answers, we just want to learn from your experience with the early version of this digital form so that we can make improvements, as needed.

We ask that you think out loud as you are going through the form. You may use fake information to fill out the form.
