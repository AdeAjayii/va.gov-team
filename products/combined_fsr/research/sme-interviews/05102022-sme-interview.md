# Notes: Meeting with David Adcock

_May 10th, 2022_

## General thoughts

* David's goal is a communication tool that both collects information and provides information about next steps

## FSR's resolution options

* The Financial Status Report (VA Form 5655) is needed for the following financial help requests:
   * "Debt forgiveness"
      * Waiver
      * Write-off
   * Compromise offer
* Repayment plans do not require an FSR submission
* The FSR is only a component of the debt forgiveness request

### Debt forgiveness 

* A Veteran shouldn't have to choose if they need a write-off or waiver 
   * It's a technicality within VHA regulations 
* David doesn't want to ask the Veteran to determine the difference 
   * He wants the Veteran to understand if they "cannot afford to pay their bill, they may request debt forgiveness"

## Payment plans

* Does not require an FSR submission
   * David also used the terms 'installment plan' or 'payment plan'
* 3 pathways to request:
   * Health Revenue/Resource Center (HRC)
      * HRC notifies VHA via an electronic system that the Veteran has requested assistance
   * Medical centers
      * There are revenue staff at every facility who electronically notify VHA that the Veteran has requested assistance
   * Veteran reaches out directly to VHA
      * Via letter, phone, "Tell your brother", "telegraph", CPAC
   * These 3 pathways do not include the Huron pathways 
* Once the notification enters VHA's workstream, they will take action on it 
* VA form 1100 is an agreement that articulates a payment plan 
   * Eventually wants a feature to guide the Veteran through the agreement online

## Next steps

* Our team will incorporate the following:
   * Adjust the combined FSR's UI to account for write-offs/waivers and compromise offers being the only debt relief options that require an FSR 
   * Ideate on how to direct Veterans looking to set up a payment plan away from the FSR and towards the correct information/resource(s)
* We have a few outstanding questions regarding content on the FSR's intro page that will be addressed asynchronously
