# Background
The Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) is seeking contractor support to help the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to migrate Veteran and Power of Attorney (PoA) experiences from the legacy Stakeholder Enterprise Platform (SEP) product and eBenefits platform to VA.gov.

The primary goal is to make it easier, safer, and faster for Veterans and people whom they assign Power of Attorney (PoA), to create and update their PoA relationships and explore new ways that VA.gov can better support Veterans who choose to interact with VA through a representative.

## OCTO Priorities
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
- Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims

## [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)
- Getting out
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring

# Research Goals
1. Understand Veterans' process with searching, selecting, and maintaining their relationship with their representative. Including Veteran goals, needs, and pain points.
2. Understand the representatives process with approving PoA and maintaining their relationship with a Veteran. Including representative goals, needs, and pain points.
3. Understand VA processes for power of attorney/representatives and how those processes can impact the Accredited Representation Management experience.

## Outcome
Clearly defined user and process needs to inform the digital Accredited Representation Management experience.

2. Do Veterans have challenges understanding why they’d want a representative?

3. Do any of the following have impact on the Veterans representative selection decision:
    - Cost
    - Community or peer feedback
