# Background
The Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) is seeking contractor support to help the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to migrate Veteran and Power of Attorney (PoA) experiences from the legacy Stakeholder Enterprise Platform (SEP) product and eBenefits platform to VA.gov.

The primary goal is to make it easier, safer, and faster for Veterans and people whom they assign Power of Attorney (PoA), to create and update their PoA relationships and explore new ways that VA.gov can better support Veterans who choose to interact with VA through a representative.

## OCTO Priorities
- Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
- Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims

## [Veteran Journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)
- Getting out
- Taking care of myself
- Retiring

# Research Goals
1. Understand Veterans' process with searching, selecting, and maintaining their relationship with their representative. Including Veteran goals, needs, and pain points.
2. Understand the representatives process with approving PoA and maintaining their relationship with a Veteran. Including representative goals, needs, and pain points.
3. Understand VA processes for power of attorney/representatives and how those processes can impact the Accredited Representation Management experience.

## Outcome
Clearly defined user and process needs to inform the digital Accredited Representation Management experience.

## Research Questions
### Veteran Process & Pain Points
1. At what point in the claims process are Veterans researching representatives? Is it at the initial claim, for decision reviews, or both?
    - What information are Veterans looking for in this process?
    - Do Veterans want to ‘shop’ representatives prior to selecting one?
2. Do Veterans have challenges understanding why they’d want a representative?
    - Do Veterans understand the differences between the representative options (VSO, attorney, claims agent)? As well as which one is best for their scenario?
3. Do any of the following have impact on the Veterans representative selection decision:
    - Cost
    - Community or peer feedback
    - Location (local or remote)
4. After a representative is selected do Veterans want a digital option  to manage their representation? Including seeing, changing, or removing representation.

### Representative (Rep) Process & Pain Points
#### About Representatives
1. What benefits can representatives support?
2. Are all representatives brought on as Power of Attorney (PoA)?
   - What systems are used to manage PoA?
3. What systems can a Representative use?
4. What is the difference between each representative (attorney, claims agent, VSO)?
   - What are the pros and cons of each representative?
   - Do representatives work alone or on teams?
   - Which representatives can and cannot charge fees?
5. Can representatives support Veterans remotely?
6. What accreditation is required for representatives? Is it nationwide or state specific?
   - Do representatives ever lose accreditation? How is loss of accreditation managed?
7. What happens once a claim has been finalized and a representative is no longer needed?
#### Veteran Representative Engagement
8. What is the typical audience the VSO supports in filing claims?
9. Can Veterans contact/request more than one representative at a time?
10. Can Veterans decline a representative after contacting them?
#### 21-22 Specific
11. What are the differences between the 21-22 and 21-22a?
12. What situations link to the 21-22? Or should link to the 21-22?

# Methodology
Secondary research to be completed using existing resources:
1. [VA GitHub Research Repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/projects/1)
2. [Reddit: Veteran Benefits Sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/VeteransBenefits/)
3. [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/)

Any questions unable to be answered through Secondary Research are recommended to be answered through Primary Research (interviews or user tests) with Veterans and Representatives for user questions, and SME interviews for VA questions.

3. Many Veterans come to VA.gov to complete **specific, well-defined** tasks, with filing and tracking **claims** being the most popular task.
4. Veterans' choices between in-person and digital support **varied**, but their choices were primarily influenced by the level of **convenience** and the **quality** of support offered.
5. Among both Veterans and representatives, attorneys were the most **easily understood** in terms of their purpose, often being the go-to choice for handling claims at the **Board** level.

## Veteran Process Details of Findings
1. Veterans seek assistance from representatives to **successfully** navigate the complex claims process in a **timely** manner, from initial submission to appeals.
   - Veterans rely on representatives to help them understand the claims process and submit a **well-prepared, evidence based** claim that is **easily understood** by the VA. Well-prepared claims can **decrease** filing time and **increase** satisfaction of the claim decision.

2. Veterans **lose trust** in representatives whose actions lead to **claim delays** or **unsatisfactory results**, leading them to explore **alternative** representation or self-help options.
   - Veterans appear to hold **diverse opinions**, especially regarding Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs), as their quality can fluctuate significantly. Among veterans, the most frequently reported **Power of Attorney (PoA) change** involved transitioning from a VSO to an attorney following an unsatisfactory disability rating or extended wait times.

    - The primary cause of claim and appeal delays are **duplicate submissions**. Such duplicates often arise from representatives' misunderstanding of claim requirements or their tendency to submit multiple copies of the same claim as a precaution, due to poor claim status and tracking.

3. Many Veterans come to VA.gov to complete **specific, well-defined** tasks, with filing and tracking **claims** being the most popular task.

4. Veterans' choices between in-person and digital support **varied**, but their choices were primarily influenced by the level of **convenience** and the **quality** of support offered.
   - Many Veterans opt to conduct online research or complete tasks **independently** before resorting to visiting a physical VA location, including expressing interest in chat-bots. When they are unable to complete the task independently, Veterans typically **prefer in-person** visits over making phone calls. This preference arises from their **frustration** with the phone tree system, which often proves ineffective in assisting them with task completion.

    - Conversely, there are numerous Veterans who **favor** in-person support, particularly widows, combat Veterans, senior Veterans, those who have never filed a claim before, and those with limited technology access. VSOs mentioned that these are the primary groups they assist. One of the **most common** reasons for visiting was to file claims and check their statuses.

5. Among both Veterans and representatives, attorneys were the most **easily understood** in terms of their purpose, often being the go-to choice for handling claims at the **Board** level.
    - They were also perceived as having the strongest motivation to "win a case" since they receive 20% of the Veteran's award as part of their fees, and they are also the most likely to establish and maintain relationships with Board staff.
