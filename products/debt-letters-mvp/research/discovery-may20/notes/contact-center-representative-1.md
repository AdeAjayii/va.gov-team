**Rebecca Walsh & Riley Orr**

**Can you tell me about your role?**<br>
Basically answering the phone calls. Trying to figure out questions of their debt, we try to set them up on payment plans, they kinda want to know where the debt came from, why it was created, the letters, some of the letters they got from COVID-19 they have a lot of questions about because they’re so vague. They ask, “What is this letter about?” I think because it’s a generic letter. 

**What is it? What are they getting?**<br>
It was a generic letter saying, “Hey, if you have problems paying your debt give us a call. We can suspend it for you or set you up on an extended payment plan” They’re very confused 

**Are all demographics confused?**<br>
Yes. Across the board. 

**Which division do you work in?**<br>
VED. 

**I’m not sure what the difference between the two divisions are. Can you tell me about the services your division provides?**<br>
Basically, that is all we do. We set up payment plans. Uhm, take payments. We deal with education debts using the Chapter 33, GI Bill. All education. We do home loans also. 

**Loan guarantee?**<br>
I do believe so, yes. 

**How many veterans do you assist a day?**<br>
Uhm, 20-50. 

**Wow. That’s a lot! Are there any other reasons veterans call other than setting up payment plans?**<br>
That’s basically what we do. But yeah there’s a lot of different phone calls. Looking for prescription, stimulus check for COVID-19… it’s across the board. We get just about any sort of call. 

**Do you reroute those when necessary?**<br>
Yup. But we do try to make it a one call resolution. If I can’t help them, I try to transfer them to the right person. 

**The calls that are relevant - can you tell me what those calls typically look like?**<br>
Uhm, what are you asking? 

**So, what’s the most common type of call that you take? Can you walk me through what that call looks like?**<br>
Yeah, so the regional office created a debt and sent it to us. They get a letter from the regional office saying they have a debt from school saying they dropped a class in the middle of the semester or what-not. They created a debt for them, they give us a call and say they can’t pay this in full and ask what we can do. Typically with education, if they are still going to school we can set them up on a payment plan using their education benefits to pay the debt off. Or, we can use their compensation disability that they have to pay that off also. And if they don’t have either benefit, then it would have to be out of their own pocket. 

**You said you worked on education and loan guarantee. Do you do comp and pension letters?**<br>
Yup, we collect on those too. 

**What would you say is the general spread of calls? Do you take more of a certain kind? A guesstimate of percentages?**<br>
Most of them are education and drill pay debts. 

**What’s drill pay?**<br>
When they’re in reserves and they work the 2 weeks or every other weekend. When they have disability compensation, they cant get paid for those days. So, the regional office goes back through every fiscal year and says, “this person worked 45 days. So, they take the disability compensation and divide it by 30 and come up with a daily rate. They take the daily rate and multiply it by the days worked.” They can’t start and stop the disability compensation so they create a debt for them every fiscal year. 

**What sort of information do you need from veterans to pull up their debt information?**<br>
Social or their VA file. Their file number. 

**Aside from the calls that are basically asking about their COVID checks and that a stuff, you’re only supposed to receive calls about debt management and stuff?**<br>
Right 

**Do you have any other general stats about calls that you think might be interesting?**<br>
Uhm, for the most part I just see a lot of people being confused about the letters they sent out. Because there’s so much info, we don’t know why the letters are so long sometimes. Just a lot of confusion. 

**Is it very common for a veteran to have multiple types of debt?**<br>
Uhm, I don’t see it too common. I see maybe 10% of the calls maybe have 2 separate types of debts whether it’s both compensation and a school debt. There’s not a whole lot of them that I see, but I do see them. 

**What happens when a veteran wants to dispute a debt?**<br> 
When they want to, we refer them to the VA form 5655. 

**How does that get delivered?**<br>
They can find it on our website or it’s usually in our debt letters 

**Ohh, it’s included as a sheet of paper in the envelope?**<br>
Yup! When our first letter goes out, there’s usually always a VA form 5655. 

**Are there any other forms or additional packets included?**<br>
In our letters? No, just the one. 

**Do you assist filling out those forms at all?**<br>
Yeah, if they have questions I’ll definitely help them out with it. May be a long call, but I try to help them out as much as possible. 

**What sort of questions do they have? Is it common to help them?**<br>
Mostly older people. That are retired and they’re in the 70s, 80s, or 90s looking at it going, “What is this?”
Basically they want to know where to put key words, the dispute so we know when they send it in what they’re asking for, get in the right spot. 

**Can you tell me a little about the range of calls that you get about education debt letters?**<br>
I see a lot of tuition debts for the students that the schools don’t pay back. So if they dropped a class within the school’s parameters, it creates a debt for the veteran but it takes the school too long to pay that back to the veteran. I do see a lot of those. 

**That’s like they dropped the class and they incur a debt that way. Is there any other way veterans are getting debt on their record?**<br>
Mitigating circumstances such as if they were hospitalized, death in the family and they dropped class. 

**In those cases, what happens?**<br>
You try to point them in the right direction to get a waiver. VA form 5655. You can ask for a lot of different things on that form. 

**Any other debts?**<br>
There’s a couple other education debts with Chapter 33. There’s a supplies debt, housing debt, and tuition debt. 

**They’re all generated the same way, like stopping going to school?**<br>
Yes, or change in the enrollment. You see a lot of it with school certifying officials entering the wrong information and going back and correcting it and that creates a debt for them because there’s a change in the enrollment. That’s kind of the bad thing about it. 

**It could be a mistake that was made by no fault by the veteran?**<br>
Yes, erroneous debt created by the certifying official. 

**In which case they’d submit the dispute form?**<br>
5655

**Have you had any sort of complaints about these letters being long, or issues arising from veterans receiving these debt letters?**<br>
Yes, I’ve seen one. There’s a sentence that says something about $25. I don’t have it in front of me. But the $25 is a minimum monthly payment we can take. So what happens is, the computer creates a payment play automatically. It’s a one year payment plan. That $25 a month is based off an exact $300 debt. I don’t like that sentence in there, I think it should be taken out because of that. 

**So people are assuming they’re paying $25 a month but that’s the minimum amount?**<br>
If you have a $200 debt it would be less than $25/mo but $25 is the minimum

**Any other complaints about education debt?**<br>
Not that I can think of

**In what way do you think having these debt letters online would benefit veterans if at all?**<br>
I think it would be easier for them because they move so much, so they’re not getting their debt letters. With only basically 90 days before it goes on a credit report, I think it would be beneficial to have it, what’s the word, so that they have easier access to them. 

**I have the same questions for compensation and pension. Why are these debts created?**<br>
I see the debts that get created coming from them not submitting their right paperwork. Whether they didn’t submit medical bills and the regional office thinks they have an increase in their pay or social security and they create a debt for them only because they didn’t submit the right form. 

**Is the resolution the same form?**<br>
Yup, we deal with the same form. There’s a couple other forms we can give to them or tell them to fill  them out. 

**What are the other forms?**<br>
Uhm, let’s see here. I have to bring up a file just to look at them. But in those letters, from the regional office, they ask for the specific form that they’re looking for. 

**So, they will know by name what form they’re looking for and the regional office will provide that to them?**<br>
They provide the debt letter. For pension, I would go in and find the regional office’s letter and read through it looking for what form they’re missing baed on how they created the debt. I go in, read the letter, and tell them to fill out this form and this form along with our form. Financial status report 

**So, you go in and you look at the regional forms and stuff in order to find instructions. Do you interact with the comp and pension division in any other way?**<br>
No. That’s kinda the hard part. Well, each office doesn’t communicate the best. I don’t think there’s enough communication between the regional offices creating the debt and our office. 

**What information do you feel like youre missing?**<br>
I would like to see how they actually create the debts, why they created them, and how they come up with the numbers. 

**You don’t have access to that?**<br>
No, some of them are so vague that when I try to look up where the debt came from there’s no letter in VBMS showing where the debt came from. 

**When you’re dealing with the veterans, you can’t tell them where the debt is coming from?**<br>
Yeah

**What are their reactions?**<br>
Upset. I mean if I can’t find a reason for a debt, they get kinda angry with ya. 

**What comes of that when they get angry?**<br>
Usually I just tell them to send it in for a dispute or a waiver on the debt with the 5655 form. 

**If they submit that form, they’re probably more likely to get the reason for the debt in the first place?**<br>
No, but we will send it (zoom popup) and they will determine whether it is approved or denied. But it takes too long. They send in a financial status report, it takes about a month in our office because there’s a backlog. That’s what we send to the committee of waivers and compromises to take a look at it and to get their response back to the veteran… sometimes it takes 6 months. I had a guy just call him saying he got the debt letter concerning his VA debt from 5 years ago. The debt was still in our system sitting in limbo because it was waiting for a decision from the committee of waivers and compromises. The debt was still there from 2015 but the decision was in VBMS. 

**So it was decided on, but the decision wasn’t told to the veteran?**<br>
He got told, but he only got the letter because of the letters that were sent out on April 27th on COVID-19. That’s the only reason he called. He got the letter and he thought he didn’t have a debt anymore. But in our system it shows he has a debt of $8000. I look in VBMS and found the decision from 2016 that it was cleared on the appeals court. It was never worked in our office to clear the debt. 

**What are the issues you see in compensation and pension?**<br>
Biggest ones I think are verifying their dependents. Some veterans don’t even know their spouse is on it so when they get divorced, they never tell the compensation office and then a year later they got a debt of $1200 or $12,000 because they didn’t verify their dependents for the last 10 years. 

**What are the next steps?**<br>
That would be the same form. 5655. Basically all the debts, to get them waived or dispute, all deals with that 5655. 

**But setting up a payment plan is a 1:1 basis worked out on the phone?**<br>
Basically over the phone. SOP. You can set up a 1 year payment plan over the phone. Anything longer than that needs the financial status report sent to the office. 

**How do they get the financial status report sent in?**<br>
Fax, email, or snail mail. 

**Is it just a form that they fill out? Is it generated?**<br> 
If you just google DebtMan, short for Debt Management. The form’s on if you scroll down, there’s a fillable one and a printable one. If you go all the way down to the bottom of the page it should say “Other VA forms”. 

**Compromise offer, waiver request, etc…. *Searching on site* I don’t see “Other VA forms”…**<br>
Gimme a second, here… *he’s pulling up the website* It says “More VA Resources”. See where it says “Find a VA form”? I tell them to click on that and I give them the form numbers and they kinda type them in. 

**Cool! So, in what ways do you think having compensation and pension debt letters online will be beneficial?**<br> 
Uhm, I think it’d still be beneficial. The more information the better. The letters are not typed up right. They don’t read right for some of the debts that people have. I think they’re kind of a general letter. I don’t know if they could reword the letter sent out for the specific debt. That would help to understand them.

**What do you think they’re not understanding?**<br>
More along the lines of how it was created. There’s no explanation from the regional office. I know the regional office letter does go out to them but sometimes they don’t see it or get it, then they get our debt letter and it says the amount of the debt and monthly payment plan. If you have any questions, give us a call. 

**So, you owe us money give it to us**<br>
Yeah, and they feel threatened by some of the letters. It almost sounds threatening to them. 

**What ways do you think we could make it less threatening?**<br>
Just reword the initial letter sent out. I know they’re computer generated, but the rewording of it would help a little bit. 

**Quickly, about the loan guarantee debt letters. I know those come out of a legacy program that was available and a lot of those people taking in those debt letters are a little older because it’s not offered anymore.**<br>
With those, there’s really no questions about those. Basically they just want a balance check for the most part. I don’t know if most of them know that when they pay the principle off they can ask for a compromised offer on the interest or not. 

**Are they supposed to know?**<br>
I would hope that they would. With each all I do get about the home loan, I do kind of explain that option because I did have one person call in from Nebraska and it’s a 50/50 state and his wife just got diagnosed with cancer and the hospital was suing all their patients for… basically this guy was trying to pay everything off, divorce his wife, get her off the kid’s home mortgage cuz she signed for it. Because if you can’t pay the debt from the hospital then they go after everything attached to that patient’s name. So he was looking how to pay off the interest and I told him to send in the compromised offer and they’ll get back to you.  They have 30 days to pay that amount in full. 

**That compromised offer is available on the DebtMan site?**<br>
5655 does everything depending on what you put in box 3. It asked why you’re completing this form: dispute, compromise offer, waiver, payment plan… I have a list here… 

**One last question about loan guarantee: you say they normally call in to check their balance. Where do you go to see that balance?**<br>
That is in CAROLS (?) It’s a program of where they store all the debts for the most part. Any active ones are in the system. I do believe after 2 years they’re paid off, they get archived out of the system. 

**What information do you think is important for veterans to know about their debt in an online portal?**<br>
I would hope they would get access to where it’s from, a balance. Some people forget that they set up a payment plan for 3 years and 2 years go by and they’re calling asking why they still have a debt. I think it’d be easier to go in and see where they’re at. 

**Is there any other information about these debt letters or accessing these debt letters that would be helpful for me to know about?**<br>
Nothing that I can think of right now. 

**Do you have any questions for me?**<br>
What you’re looking for is to get the information to the veterans, right? 

**Yup, delivering the letters themselves. We’re looking for ways to supplement that experience other than just a digital version of the letter.**<br>
I think more personalized letters should be typed up. I know the programming is in there to do that, but will the VA do that? I don’t know.
