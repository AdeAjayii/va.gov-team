## Executive Summary

Julie Lawrence is the Chief of Education and External Relations and Treasury Section at the DMC. She runs multiple teams that handle different kinds of debt; these teams are typically 10-15 folks ranging from entry level to chief positions. All of the employees attend a DMC 101 class for 13 weeks and receive weekly training to refresh their knowledge as they assist Veterans with their debts. 

### The teams that handle Veterans’ debts

**1. Debts referred to the Treasury program**<br>
This team works with debts that are aged and get referred to the US Treasury Program for collection action.

**2. Congressional responses**<br>
This team deals with inbound calls from elected officials and outbound calls to veterans and beneficiaries. For example, a Veteran could reach out to an elected official with questions about their debt, and the elected official or their staff contacts the DMC. 

**3. Education debt**<br>
This team works on education cases. There are two types of cases: debts owed by students/beneficiaries attending higher education, and debts owed by higher education institutions.

**4. Electronic correspondence**<br>
This team handles all electronic correspondence that comes through IRIS. Veterans can contact the Electronic Correspondence team through email or selecting the “Ask a question” link on VA.gov. 

Veterans call to request information for payment plans or ask how their debt can be waived. When handling debt cases, employees have access to the following information: why the debt was created, what letters were sent, when the letters were sent, and where the Veteran is in the debt process. However, Compensation and Pension letters are in a separate system from Education letters. Some reasons a Veteran can acquire a Compensation and Pension debt include unclaimed divorces or not removing dependents. 

Veterans can receive an Education debt if a student changes enrollment or drops out of classes. A student can have three different education debts at the same time: tuition, housing, and books.

> “The letter from the regional office will have all of them combined, but each debt is treated separately so they will get 3 separate letters.”

These separate debts can be paid with one check. However, if the Veteran wants to pay their debts online then they need to submit separate transactions for each debt. This can be time consuming, as all the Veteran’s information needs to be manually entered for each payment. 

Julie thinks that the letters can be long and the language could be improved; however, she also thinks online letters would be beneficial for the student population because they are both transient and tech-savvy. Additionally, she noted that certain parts of the Veteran population may not use an online portal. She sees potential for online self-service features such as requesting a waiver or submitting the form Veterans complete for a payment plan (VA Form 5655). She thinks it’s vital for Veterans to know the reasons why they have a debt, where it came from, and the options available to them.

## Transcript

**Can you tell me about your role?**<br>
So I am the chief of the education and external relations and treasury section at DMC. My teams work throughout several benefit types. On the treasury side, I have a team that works with debts that are aged and get referred to the US Treasury Program for collection action. When people have questions, they go to the treasury and the treasury goes back to us. That’s one part of my group. I also have a group that does Congressional responses so if someone goes to their elected official and has a question or wants someone to. intervene on their behalf we respond to those high profile cases. Cases that get elevated to senior level executives, that can be across any benefit types. I have a team that works on education cases. Those cases are really two different types: owed by students/beneficiaries attending higher education, and debts owed by the higher education institution. My team works both of those types answering questions, understanding how debts came about,  and how to resolve them either through payments from ongoing education benefits or compensation and pension benefits, cash payments, or getting referred to the treasury once they get aged and getting that method of payment. I have an external correspondence team that handles inbound electronic correspondence. So, if a veteran mailed us hard copy mail or sends us a fax, all of that generally goes to another team. If a veteran emails us something or goes to VA.gov or clicks on “Ask a question” link, those all come to my e-correspondence team and we process those questions if we can and/or we route them to the appropriate email that can answer them.

**It sounds like you have a team that deals with more frontline sort of action with the last two teams you mentioned and you have teams that are more escalating sort-of-teams.** <br>
Yes, all sort of spectrum

**What sort of employee structure do you have within those teams?**<br>
We do have some entry-level employees that come in at a very basic level. I also have some midlevel employees that typically would be folks that have been here longer and eligible for a promotion.  Then I have some analysts that again, are a more senior position. Folks that are really SMEs and then I have I have firstline supervisors and two chiefs that report to me at the top of the division. I report to the director of operations to reports to our executive director.

**These specialized teams, are they very big?**<br>
They range from about 10-15 people. Assuming 0 vacancies.

**Is that a regular shift where they’re working 8-6 or whatever?**<br>
Yes

**What sort of training do these representatives have before interacting with veterans?**<br>
As a new hire at our organization, folks are generally put through the DMC 101 class which is traditionally roughly 13 weeks of intensive technical training. Upon graduation from that training class, they are then distributed to each division whichever one they’d be assigned to. Folks will then get anywhere from 2-4 weeks of mentoring or team training where they learn the various types of work the team they’re going to does. Sometimes it takes, depending on the learning style of the person and what the team’s priorities are, they may learn one type of work or they may learn all the teams’ types of works in that time period. We also do recalibration training so each week, ideally, we have about an hour or so that we will send our entire division through training that ranges from work topics that our team does and to refresh everyone so they stay current on policies and procedures to types of work that our team does not work but our center works and they may run into just to kind of refresh them from something they haven’t touched since their initial 13 weeks to general knowledge training that may or may not be something from one of our VA partners or external partner like Treasury. We also do professional development training. For example, resume writing or interview training something along those lines that they can use in their daily work. We also do quarterly team building where we combine the technical training refresher with a professional development course with an outside activity that’s veteran-centric 

I only have one team that takes phone calls. My congressional team. Those folks take inbound calls from elected officials or their staffers. They will make outbound calls to folks that send inquiries through white house hotline. Those are directly to veterans or beneficiaries. The rest of my team deals with written request. 

**Can you explain what your team’s interactions with the debt letters are?**<br>
You have the 100, 101, 130, 117, and the 123 letter. In any case, my team does, in general, their interaction with those letters (the letters are automated)… 99% of those letters are mailed out of a government print contractor. We see those letters on our system every day. Each of those letters have a specific meaning and purpose. When my congressional team responds to an elected official, they will respond by thanking them for inquiring the debt. “This debt was created on this day for this reason for this vet, then it went to the DMC, the first letter went out this day, the next letter went out on this day. Based on all that and a lack of response we went to the Treasury. They were notified on such and such day” They have to know what each letter means and the purpose is, and when those letters are sent out, but it’s rare that they’d be sending out those letters

**When you’re looking at the system that tells about the information when it was created, you’re able to see the letters and date of the letters prior to the going to the DMC and those 5 official letters going out from the DMC?**<br>
Yes, we can go into the benefits offices’ data and see the information in the letters that led up to the debt being created.  We have to look for them. 

**How?**<br>
Depending on the type of debt it is, if it’s compensation and pension it’s in one system, education in a different system. If it’s first party medical debt it’s in a different system. Oh, my treasury team deals with VBA as well as VHA debt so we pull in both pieces. Most of DMC does not. As far as actual DMC letters, we can going the system that houses those and view them as well. That’s relatively new capability for us to actually see the actual letter. We can do that now from everything with the exception of a certain type of education  debt we cannot see.

**Which type?**<br>
The TOE (Transfer of entitlement). Within chapter 33 post-9/11 GI Bill education benefit, certain veterans were given a re-signing bonus and an enticement to re-enlist. They signed a contract when active duty that said they can transfer their post-9/11 GI benefit to a dependent if they sign the contract to re-enlist until XYZ date in the future. The folks using those chapter 33 post-9/11 GI Bill are a spouse or a child. Those benefits come through under the dependent’s social security number. When we try to save those numbers, it doesn’t recognize the ID number so it does not create a new folder for them, it just rejects and goes away. There’s nothing we can do. It’s only a small piece, but we don’t have a good solution for that right now. 

**How many veterans would you say your team or a single rep assists a day?**<br>
That’s gonna vary depending on the type of work. For example, my treasury team could be working on a type of work called “proof of debt”. They can do thousands of those using tools a day. Also, I have a congressional team that may have a super complex case that may require them to spend 2-3 days on one case. There isn’t really an average number. It just depends on the type of work on the particular day. 

**How are these cases tracked right now?**<br>
Several of my teams’ types of work, we track them manually in a log that’s essentially just a spreadsheet. We have analysts that take the inbound work and log it and then the staff, the employees working it, will self-assign it to them and follow up and close it out when that’s appropriate. We also have a system that is a paperless… we call it a frontend scanner or paperless system where every hard copy sent in gets scanned and some of my team can work by going through the queue of their work type and work it. We also get reports, some of those reports are from treasury and some of them are from our system. Some of them come from our central office and so those reports are assigned out. And then sometimes it’s one person or two people that work the report. Sometimes it’s 10 people that work on a report. We save that document on a shared Drive and people can get the file numbers to do the work. 

We also get inbound work electronically, so we have corporate inboxes that my team manages. We assign people to, in some cases, we batch the emails and assign to some people and they go and work them. One of the VA.gov… has a question form where if people choose the DMC then we work through that system. It’s called IRIS. We get those inquiries and work through those as well. That’s a separate system people need to log in for

**What do those kind of consist of?**<br>
All over the board. It could be something as simple as “what’s my balance” or “what address do i send payment to?” or something where they need a request in writing so they send the document and attach, or a repayment plan or “how does this process work”. “I disagree with the debt, I got this letter, what does it mean?” All over the place 

**Is there any way we could get a log of these sorts of questions?**<br>
Not yet. I mean, we’re working to put together some frequently asked questions. We have a list of those on our website as well. VA.gov/debtman. There is a frequently asked questions section so you can see some of those questions we receive. But those are pretty high level. As far as tracking, we get X number of this many questions and X number of that many questions… we don’t track that. 

**Do your teams work with multiple times?**<br>
Many of my teams do. Congressional team.. (missed the other team). Routing to appropriate people to get the right answers. IRIS folks again can deal with questions on a high level or route. 

**How do they know where to route?**<br>
We have a job aid that we give them and a lot of it is on the job training

**Do you know how often debt letters sent to veterans to the edu team go unanswered and are transferred to the DMC? Is it common that the initial letters go unanswered and have to be escalated?**<br>
It is very common. At any time we can have 600,000 cases or more in our system. The general process for, say comp and pension, the benefits office sends out a proposal offer that says “we need to validate your dependents, so complete this form and if we don’t get it to you within 60 days. If they don’t get a response or the response doesn’t match, the debt is created and goes over to us. If the response they get validates, then there would be no debt. As you know, people get married and divorced, new children, children go live with X spouses, that stuff happens all the time. There’s a fairly large percentage of those proposals that do become debts. Another example in the education world, a student signs up for 3 classes and after the first… (Zoom alert popped up about the call ending)… students change enrollment and classes all the time. Huge volume. About 65% of the 600k cases are education-related. They’re typically for smaller $ amounts than for compensation & pension debts. 

**How does the lower $ amount effect the conversations?**<br>
In the post-9/11 GI Bill, there are various types of payments a beneficiary can receive: if i take 3 classes i’ll get a book stipend for each of those classes. I’m also going to get tuition paid for each of those 3 classes. I’m also going to get a housing payment based on my rate of pursuit. If that changes and I drop a class, there could be 3 types of debt because there’s 3 types of payments. 

**Do those all get delivered separately? Different letters?**<br>
Yes, the letter from the regional office will have all of them combined, but each debt is treated separately so they will get 3 separate letters. It can be confusing because the only thing they get are different dollar amounts and a code number. Because they’re separate debts, we have to treat them separately.

**They basically get identical letters but different amounts?**<br>
It’ll say housing debt or tuition debt, dollar amount, code. Tuition is paid directly to the school they’re enrolled in. If they drop a class, the student is responsible for paying back that tuition money. Every school has a different refund policy. They might get a full refund, they might get a prorated refund. The VA decides that’s for them to deal with the school 

**When they go to pay these debts, they’re paid individually as well. Is that a complaint?**<br>
In some cases. If they get three letters, they get three payment stubs. They could take those 3 payment stubs, write one check, and send it in to us. We can process that and allocate the funds. If we don’t have the payment stubs then we have to manually go through it. If they pay online, they have to pay in 3 separate transactions. The system will not allow them to aggregate one sum total. It will not process it. 

**Do the payments take very long?**<br>
No, but it’s a little bit clunky because there’s not a way to log in. For example, if I’m making a car payment online I have a username and password and I select the car and the amount I want to pay. In most cases, it saves my previously used payment methods and will let me pay it. This system does not do it. They have to enter the information on the letter and payment method each time. If you have 3 debts, you have to start from scratch and redo each payment. Some debts are assigned to education institutions. Some educational institutions have a large number of students and large number of debts so if they do it online they have to do this separately. 

**We want to deliver these letters in a digital format. Do you have any general thoughts about this?**<br>
I do think that it’s a benefit for some veterans. But for others, I’m not convinced that there’s any benefit. For example, my mother and deceased father-in-law receive benefits. They don’t even have a computer. They get a letter from the VA, the first they do is they bring it over to me and say they don’t know what the letter means. They don’t understand it. They have on idea how to respond, they’d never be able to fill out an online application for something. I see both pieces of that, I do think it’s important that we have this information available for people online but we have a lot of veteran population that is not going to use it. My real dad is also a veteran and he gets his healthcare through the VA and last summer was going through some health issues so I’ve been trying for a year to get him on My HealtheVet and he doesn’t have a smart phone or computer. It’s impossible. 

**When this population who isn’t so tech-savvy getting these pieces of mail, they’re either calling or writing somebody?**<br>
There’s a number. They either call or write, but they don’t necessarily understand what the letters are about. My parents go to the county office and ask for help. It’s nice when they’re available, but in the current pandemic they are not. It causes a lot of frustration

**For this group of people who will benefit, in what ways do you think they will benefit?**<br>
I deal with a lot of the education benefit world. A lot of those people tend to be transient and tech-savvy. They would never follow up on a letter, but they’d follow up from a text, email, or social media. If they got a link that said to check their eBenefits account for a letter then they’d do that. But, they’d need a quick link to it. They’d be getting the information wherever they may be. A travel abroad student, a student doing internships at various hospitals. Getting them the information they need quickly is critical. 

**The delivery of this information, is there anything about the actual information being delivered itself that could be improved?**<br>
I would never say the letters are perfect. I think there’s a lot that can be done and there’s other projects fine-tuning the letter language and recognizing the veteran population we send letters to may be elderly and can’t understand the level of the language, folks with PTSD or brain injuries. It may be that we send a 10 page letter and the info they need is on page 8 and they don’t have time to sift through all the pages. I will say that my team also owns all the outreach we do through DMC. So, we are responsible for attending 60-70 conferences on a normal year where we send SMEs and leaders out to educate about our letters, processes, our contacts, what do people do, what can we do to help, those kinds of things. We reach 10s of thousands of stakeholders who reach multitudes of veterans. We connect with veterans through social media and text messages so we’ve ramped up our veteran-facing outreach. We used to focus more on veteran service officers or education institutions, women veterans, veterans experiencing homelessness, but we’re working on it. 

**Once a veteran gets a debt letter, what’s the next step they should take if they don’t immediately write a check?**<br>
Sometimes they will call our call center and ask where the debt came from. Generally, they know, but they don’t know where the dollar values are coming from. Sometimes they call us and tell us the dependent verification form wasn’t processed in time so the debt is going away. Sometimes they call and say the debt is real but I can’t afford it in one chunk so how can I make payments? Sometimes they request a waiver and how to get the debt waived. Sometimes they will say they can’t afford to pay the full amount back would you accept this compromise offer? So, they may just elect one of those options and go about doing it, or they may call us and ask about the options and we talk them through what would be the appropriate option. 

**Do you think this could be aided by self service going forward?**<br>
Yes, we could say if you request a waiver click this that and continue. If you want a payment plan then click here and fill out this form. I think there’s some self-service help that would be helpful but I don’t see how that would get rid of the need for the call center. A lot of people don’t like to call call centers and would prefer… I mean I hate calling my cable company because it’s obnoxious so I would prefer an IM chat off their website. It’s easier to type than to talk to somebody. I know that there are other people, my mother-in-law, will not pick up the phone and call someone because she has hearing aids. We have her phone set up so voicemails turn into text messages for her. I would like to see that sort of functionality at some point for our aging veteran population that has hearing issues.

**When they’re calling in and finding the solution… I’m gonna pay X dollar amount, are the forms you’re referring to… are those fully filled out over the phone with the call center rep right now or sent a hard copy?**<br>
When they get their debt letters, their initial letter comes with the form. If they want to do specific choices then they do need to complete that form with a signature. If they email it to us then we accept that as a digital signature. They can go to the VSO and have them help fill it out and send it in with  a signature, fax with signature, there’s lots of ways. It would be great to do that online. 

**What problems are veterans experiencing with debt letters?**<br>
With an education-type debt, some of them is that they don’t get them, some is that they get three different letters for three debts and they don’t get that, some of it is not understanding how the benefit programs work

**What are their misunderstandings?**<br>
Let’s say a veteran is married and he gets a base rate and an extra amount per dependent. If that veteran gets divorced and then gets married a year later and five years down the line he adds a child, he’s going to have a debt all the way back to the date of the first divorce and will not add the new spouse or child until the day the child is added 
We get people that say I was in the service and I earn these benefits and you can’t make me pay this back, again it’s a lack of understanding  

**What information do you think is important for veterans to know about their debt?**<br>
I think it’s important to know the reasons and comprehend where the debts came from. I think it’s important to understand the options available to them. Some people just pay when it comes in the mail, other people aren’t like that and can’t pay the debt.
