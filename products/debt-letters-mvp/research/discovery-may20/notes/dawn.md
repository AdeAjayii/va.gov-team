# Dawn E. Interview
May 8, 2020<br>
**Rebecca Walsh & Riley Orr**

**Can you tell me about your role?**<br>
I’m an assistant chief. I have one (cut out) and the two of us report to the chief. Between Jodi and I, we have 106 employees. We have 89 debt councilors. Roughly 45 each. We operate a veteran-facing contact center and our primary function is to collect benefit debt from veterans and their beneficiaries 

**And that is different from Julie who collect health debts?**<br>
Right. Everyone from DMC will have a debt collection role. Ours is different in the fact that Julie has Congressional and other stuff, but we take inbound phone calls. We don’t do a lot of outbound phone calls unless requested (comes through IRIS or we get a letter asking us to call them) I have two teams and an escalated group for calls that go out of control or there’s something extremely complex. Our phone representatives (debt councilors), if it’s too in-depth then it comes offline and goes to a different team to do some digging and networking. 

**What sort of training do your debt councilors go through for interacting with veterans?**<br>
The training program is 13.5 weeks. At about week 8 they pull them from the normal classrooms and sit and listen and do on-the-job training because they don’t need to get way into the weeds whereas ours start listening to their peers and finding out the way the calls sound and applying the things they’ve learned in the real world. 6-7 minute phone call (Dawn cuts out a lot). So, they have the 8 or so weeks in training and they go out on the floor. They listen, then depending on comfort level they will be on the phone and a mentor will sit with them and help them. This was before COVID… COVID’s a little different now… we’re doing some conference calling which is impressive and using IM instead of talking. Either way they get questions answered. As they get comfortable, that mentor will take phone calls and ask questions intermittently as they need help

**Do they have any sort of handbook or anything with general procedures we could have access to?**<br>
Uhm, we have a SharePoint site but our overarching policy is to answer the phone in so many seconds, I mean it’s pretty basic ISO 9000 SOP. I’m not sure it would be helpful besides, “answer professionally, end call professionally”. 

**How many veterans do you typically assist a day?**<br>
In a perfect world the calls are often much longer [than 6 minutes]. I wanna say around 3,000. Jodi would probably know right off the top of her head. 3000-ish

**Are these calls coded in any sort of system? Would we be able to get statistics?**<br>
No, we do not have those. Our system is not that way. We don’t have that kind of system yet. At some point we will have Salesforce. So, at that point there will be more data available. 

I have to ask, so exposing letters... How do our SOPs and items pertain to exposing our letters?**<br>

**You know, we are at the stage where we don’t know where we don’t know. I do want to make sure we’re providing the right content. It’s mostly about content creation. If we do expose the letters, we want to make sure that the veterans can find the next steps they need to take, who to contact, if they have certain questions, so we can have a little more self-service.**<br> 
It is around 3000. We have a pretty high call volume recently because of the COVID thing and we sent some stuff out and there’s been mass emails. Yesterday we had 3800, day before 3800, day before 8000. It gets pretty crazy. 

**We might end up having to ask a little bit more of those types of questions when we’re trying to measure the success of the product so if we see fewer calls or something that may be an indicator of self-service. That’s not under my area of expertise but I may be talking out of turn.**<br>
That’s exactly one of the things we’d want to do. Once we move to Salesforce this summer, we will have much better statistics to do exactly what you’re saying. We have some we can help, but we’re gonna get there. 

**What information do you need to pull up their information?**<br>
You have a greeting, can I get your VA file number or social security number, so the callers in most cases would have received correspondence from Debt Management prior to them calling us. 

**Oh, so they receive those 5 letters**<br>
100, 117, 123, 145,.. I have the list somewhere 

**I gather that your team receives calls about debt management. Do you work with education comp & pension, etc.?**<br>
We should only get questions about debt management. But we get many, many questions because we have a very big view because we work on many different kinds of debt and with that comes a lot of system access. People who have dealt with us in the past realize we’re a one-stop-shop to ask questions about education that should go to the education center, or they’ll call us cuz they sent the paperwork to regional office and ask if they’re working on it yet, so we get misdirected calls a lot

**What types of letters do you get calls about the most?**<br>
I don’t know if I have a statistic that would tell me that. I was on the phone for a few years, from my perspective the one we get the biggest reaction to is one that increases the debt or one that gets sent to credit reporting agencies. 

**How many types of debt does a veteran typically have? More than one? One type?**<br>
Education, there’s multiple ways they receive a benefit… book benefit, tuition, housing, each one of those comes to us as a separate individual debt. It is very common, especially in education, to have more than one debt for an individual. Just because if they drop a class they aren’t entitled to housing, books, or tuition. 

**What options are available to dispute debts?**<br>
If you called in, and were wondering about the debt… the new letters for compensation at least divide the payment plan to pay it off in a year. They divide it into 12 payments. If you’re saying you can’t make the payment or it’s not your fault, there’s a couple options. You can reduce payment plan which requires VA Form 5655. Anything over a year I need a financial status report. Anything over 3 years, there’s only a certain level of person that can approve that. So I would ask if $200 is too much a month then what’s an amount that works? If I can find something that works for me, then I would take that. If it doesn’t work, then I’d explain additional options. I’d need the form submitted which would be reviewed by David’s team and with that paperwork they’ll make a determination based on the income and send a letter out through the mail. The other options.. if you’ve sent in the 5655 and you’re calling me and I can see the form then I can process it right over the phone. A normal debt councilor can go to three years. They can say, “yes, I can approve this”. They have the authority to approve for 3 years. To dispute debt, I would guide them through the process of submitting the right form back to the benefit office that they are disputing the debt. They could also request a compromise offer. Maybe they owe me $500 but they say I only want to pay $100 and be done, then I would guide them to send a written statement and financial status report to pay $100 as a compromise which would go to a committee. That would pretty much be it. 

**Can you tell us a little bit about the education debt letters? We know if someone dropped a class, they have to return the money from the beginning of the term, but is there anything particularly troublesome about the debt letters related to education?**<br>
The only thing that’s troublesome is from a user perspective it would be nice to get one letter that’s a result of your action. It would be nice to get one letter “as a result of your action, your debt for this is this, your debt for that is that” so you can one letter. That won’t change soon. If we’re speaking specifically debt letters, they don’t list the term that’s impacted. How the process works is, education processes the certificate that came from the school/college and it results in something that generates a letter saying they have a debt and they list all the details on that letter, but all they do is send the type of debt and dollar amount to debt management. So, there’s no tie back. You have to go back through letters and go to the education’s letter. I think that’s probably confusing and frustrating for veterans. Debt councilors will generally help with that, but if they’re asking a lot of specific questions like that they’re not going to pay it then we will send it to education. It’s very situational 

**Is there any reason why having these letters online would benefit the veterans?**<br>
I think those individuals going to school, are very technologically advanced individuals. They’re used to seeing everything online, so they’d be more inclined to view it online. All their class information is in an online format, so to have to use snail mail would be frustrating. That’s some communication I’ve heard from veterans. “I should be able to log it and see it” (Dawn cutting out a lot) They’re very mobile, so in my perfect world they’d be able to do it in an app. 

**Julie did mention that the number of emails they get are around 65% education. Do you think that’s also kind of true?**<br>
Let me take a look and I can tell you percentage-wise. It appeared as though, generally speaking, we get twice as many education calls than comp & pension.

**We’ve talked a lot about education debt letters, is there anything else you think we should know about the education debt letters in surfacing those online?**<br>
I don’t. From my standpoint, we deal with all the debts we deal with the same way. Julie is very specifically education and probably has real opinion on those letters. From my perspective they all need to be rewritten and handled better. 

**Anything that can be more helpful when exposing online?**<br>
Our current state of letters? Any of the suggestions I have would not be something they’d be able to implement. I’d love for it to tie back to the RPO letter. With the way ours is currently set up in the system does not allow that. I think the letters are not great, I wish they had more detail, but I understand the system limitations to get there. 

**Compensation and pension: what are the specific problems associated with those letters?**<br>
Those ones tend to be not quite as bad as the education ones because the debts don’t happen that often. When someone gets divorced, changed in dependency, those are more life events and aren’t as frequent or repetitive as the education side. They don’t happen as often so people remember what happened that created it. “Oh yeah I got divorced. Oh yeah my kid turned 18” Those aren’t as bad for whatever reason. The only ones that are rough are drill pay letters. Those are probably… those are compensation but not compensation. It’s a little weird. Those aren’t bad I don’t think. 

**When you do get calls, what do they consist of?**<br>
It’s the same kind of thing. The only time people get wound up is when there’s massive delays. So if I get divorced last year July 1 and I reported it July 20 and the VA didn’t process it until April 1, well I told you I got divorced so why did you keep paying me? So, processing delay. They’re voicing their frustration. 

From the education side, the school does the notifying. On the compensation side, a lot of it is on the veteran. So when they own it and they feel the VA doesn’t, they feel frustrated. But, I put my taxpayer hat on and wonder why they didn’t put it aside. But I recognize in reality that’s easy to say but not easy to do. (Dawn cutting out)

**Is there anything else we should be aware of for comp & pen letters?**<br>
Uhm, (cutting out) I recognize there’s system limitations to be tied to regional office letter. So, to me I think it would be so nice if we had a product that had proposal letter, decision letter, debt letter tied together in a nice package instead of just thrown in a folder. Then there’d be folders for everything instead of date order so it makes sense. 

**What about loan guarantee?**<br>
Loan guarantee is tough. Those ones are a struggle simply because, loan guarantee letters are a very very old program. The people who these debts belong to are generally older and living on a fixed income. So that population is an older generation, so that makes it harder from that standpoint that they are often not the most technological-savvy. That’s the biggest struggle, the population.

All our letters are generic, the only difference is name of letter and deduction code. To a normal user, they wouldn’t see the difference in the letter. 

**Is there an opportunity to improve the veteran experience by providing these letters online?**<br>
Certainly, let’s say a veteran gets a letter and they call us. We won’t talk to them unless they have a third party release. You can’t call for your parent. A lot of these people want someone to call for them. If they can be exposed online, then their trusted person can help them look at it online to help them dissect it a little easier. 

**These loan guarantee debts, this is an old program so no new debts?**<br>
Right, the new debts are not handled by us. The whole program is different. We’re dealing with legacy users. You’ve got foreclosed on your house, you owe the VA money, we can’t get collections for you so 20-30 years down you are eligible to receive benefits, we do a match every month and we’re gonna take it back off the shelf and start collecting. So you may have thought it’s forgiven or they forgot.

**Those original letters are shelved?**<br>
They are ooooold. 

**You still have hard copies of these letters?**<br>
On microfilm they will print them out. 

**What is the next step a veteran should take besides sending a check?**<br>
When I talk at conferences, the thing I try to drill in is when the VSO talks to Veterans, call debt management if you can’t pay it. Don’t put it off, don’t think it’ll go away. Call us! We are not scary! We are helpful, and we will give other options. I would love to see linking to VSOs that can help them. There’s times where people call and don’t know what to do, we will refer them to a VSO.  I think that would be helpful if something on our site pointed to that. Something so they know they aren’t in it alone. They shouldn’t be scared. We get a lot of thank you letters! People call us terrified and we tell them we can take $100 a month and their stress is reduced

**What information do you think is important for veterans to know about their debt that they aren’t getting now?**<br>
1: I think they get all the information, but it’s hard to understand that when don’t agree with an action that caused a debt that doesn’t come to debt management. If I don’t agree you took my child off in March because his bday isn’t until May… like, debt management doesn’t create the debt. It’s the action by the regional office that results in a debt. So they have to take a two prong approach. They’re trying to pay the debt and correct information to fix their benefit that resulted in a debt. They have to take it from a two prong approach and can’t assume one side is talking to the other 

**If they pay off something done in error, what happens after that?**<br>
When the regional processing site takes the processing action, if they’re entitled to money, even if the debt was there or not in the VA system they weren’t due the money, so if they’re now due money then it will be paid out. If they have a debt then it would be paid out to a debt and the rest would be going to the debtor. 

**We noticed you collect surveys on Debtman.**<br>
That is very generic data and I wouldn’t give it to him. We’re getting rid of it anyway. At some point I might show it to him, but the data collection right now is very generic 

**You mostly take inbound calls, do you have any sort of email volume that comes through?**<br>
We have internal emails, but we shouldn’t be dealing too much with emails dealing with veterans. My escalation team do deal with emails from veterans. They will interact very directly with the veteran. They take a case that’s crazy and connect with all the right POCs to get it back on track. A lot of our emails come to the same place and get uploaded into a system. Sometimes people go rogue.
