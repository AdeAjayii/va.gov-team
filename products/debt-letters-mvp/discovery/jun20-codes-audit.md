# DMC Diary Codes Audit

This work happened in June 2020 in order to understand what sort of statuses debts can be in for the sake of design work. For this work, we looked into the DMC's Diary Codes sent to us in Excel format.

## High-level debt "statuses"
**NOTE**: This may not be an exhaustive list and must be confirmed with the DMC. Points under each of the statuses often have multiple diary codes related to them.

- **Debt is being communicated** (Due process letters)
  -   Demand letters [100, 101, 102, 117]
  -   CRA referral notification [122]
