# Debt Letters Wireframes

## May 28
Wireflow created for the purpose of sharing during Design Intent Checkin after [team ideation](https://app.mural.co/t/vsa8243/m/vsa8243/1590173930514/c0dcc29fddb240204b0e1f93cc0b1caf2c04f421), where we decided the following:
- [Debtman content page(s)](https://www.va.gov/debtman/) being replaced
- Despite the primary requirement being to provide letter downloads on VA.gov, tool should be debt-centric rather than letter-centric, as the data structures being sent to us support that upgrade easily
- Debt history _can_ include statuses that are not directly associated with the letters in our scope (e.g. 'Bad Address' statuses can be reported)
- Alerts could potentially be incorporated to bring attention to debts that have changed since the Veteran last viewed them
- Resolved debts seem helpful and can be incorporated

**Note:** content is hastily done and representative of content type rather than actual direction!
