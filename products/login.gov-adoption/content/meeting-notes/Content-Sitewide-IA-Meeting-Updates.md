### Content Sync

## June 12, 2023

## Attendees: Sofia Kirkman, Danielle Thierry

## Notes:
- Set up this meeting to understand how Danielle uses Google Analytics to look at data for blogs (acc to Tim Hudak from VEO)
- https://news.va.gov/119761/securely-accessing-your-va-account-online/ was not distributed through normal pathways, according to Elizabeth, so this could explain why there is not a lot of comments on it
- Discovered that news.va.gov is not tagged for Google Analytics tracking - we might need to reach out to the Analytics team if we want blogs tracked moving forward
- Google Analytics can be tracked for campaign landing pages
- When using Google analytics:
  -  In the future the data used for PACT will move to GA4 but for now use Va.gov production and All VA.gov Website Data
  -  Put link to URL into search bar
  -  Look at Page views, Avg time on page, Entrances, Bounce rate
  -  Under events you can see what event action people are taking

  - Save a report and name it and export
  - Can create dashboards 
  - Under audience and user explorer you can try to track where people came from (although Danielle has only gotten this to work a few times)
  - Danielle and Sitewide use Medallia data from online survey
  - Resources and support requested to have a button for "how would you rate your experience on this page?" < Good or Bad
  - Medallia allows you to customize 
  - VAMC have a survey for experiences online
  - Danielle can share the data for FAQs which are usually complaints about the process

## Attendees: Sofia Kirkman, Carl Dickerson, Aliyah Blackmore, Laura Willwerth, Joe Niquette, Amber Parsley, Ngozi Abolarin

## Notes:
- Last week we made edits to the Account Creation and Sign-in Page and there was discussion around the differences between the Login.gov and ID.me IAL2 processes
  - No forced verification but there is very limited access with IAL1
  - We had this discussion because need to find out what types of confirmation emails are being referred to on the sign in page. There is a confirmation email that users receive when they create an account as well.
- Account Verification FAQ Page
- Remove first FAQ after speaking with Carnetta
- will look into/vetting requirements for phone to be in your name for Login.gov (because it doesn't say that on Login); and adding a note that if you can't fulfill the phone verificaton step, they can send you a letter in the mail.
- need to align the language for the CTA -- currently one says "go to Login." and other says "visit DSL"
- changing question from verifying at VA health facility to verifying at USPS
  - explain the steps to verify your identity in person
  - explain that IPP happens after you have failed the online verification option
  - more people are verifying online successfully (using Login.gov and ID.me)
  - Joe: there will be an executive order released for VA to have an IPP solution
  - There may be a future FAQ for an IPP process at a VAMC owned by VA

## Attendees: Sofia Kirkman, Carl Dickerson, Aliyah Blackmore, Laura Willwerth, Danielle Thierry

## Notes:

- Login.gov blog rework

- Make post about account creation and mention post office 
- Go online and create a login.gov or id.me account and then discuss options for verification failure
- Right now in person is only for failure
- Link over to the Login.gov material

- Acknowledge that people are having trouble
- Danielle’s paragraph: “We know that some Veterans are reporting having trouble verifying their identity to create a Login.gov account. We encourage you to create your account now and contact the Login.gov help center if you need support. If you can’t verify your identity online, you can now go to select U.S. post offices to verify your identity in person. You also have the option to create a verified ID.me account to manage your VA benefits and health care.”

- Next blog: IPP at post office for veterans having trouble with the account creation
  - resolve for lack of awareness around Login.gov

Video for MFA can be linked to CLP

Can we send out a broader security message without focusing on Login.gov?
No: Make Login.gov the heart of the message rather than down further
Add in person verification

- Might be a good time to ask John, Tom, and Carnetta about adding information about IPP to Sitewide

- VA benefits for Campaign landing page
  - Transitioning service members
  - Family member hub
  - Disability and healthcare

- Veterans expect a smooth and seamless process

## Notes:
- PDF:
  - Account creation guide is IAL1 only
  - Document has been made 508 compliant
  - The document might be duplicative of other content that can be sourced for learning and training purposes
  - Might consider using this document as a tool to learn from rather than a veteran facing document on the Campaign 
  
- Landing Page
  -  landing page will be a hub for all Login.gov content
  -  we will start off by linking existing content and we may consider adding new content that pertains to the campaign

- Blog around security
  - John has reviewed but we can implement changes from Sitewide to draft after review
  - Will socialize to Jordene for review

## Notes:
- Clean up agenda items from Identity Comms meetings:
  - Sitewide Content is currently adding feedback from Tom and John to FAQs
  - Redirected and retired "How to get a premium DSL account"
  - Confirmed that no VA.gov pages will link to eBenefits that require DSL by time of sunset
  - We are still waiting on Login.gov to giv us additional info on in-person proofing and account creation process

- VA.gov static pages progress is captured but other efforts from LGA and Core team is not because it's not clear what is comms and there is no plan we are following
- Blog post: Carl is going to finish a draft by Monday and he will meet with Amber and Charlye from Core on Friday 5/5 to go over preliminary findings and work them into the post
- Make sure Clayton's research readout loops in Sitewide Content team
- Email drafts - look at after Clayton's research wraps up
 

## Next steps:
