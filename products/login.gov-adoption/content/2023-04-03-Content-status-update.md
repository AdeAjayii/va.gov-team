|Newsletter|Awareness feature went out in early January; plans in comms strategy for at least 2 more posts leading into launch; Work with VEO to define next posts & timing|
|Pre-login modal|We cannot target users pre-login, so there will be no modal; Have discussed and plans for pre-login urgency banner- “DS Login is going away xx date”, closer to sunsetting of DS Logon.|
|Post-login modal|Content drafted; Reviewing in [Round 1 of Testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/2023-02-Grandfathering-Migration-Round-1-Usability)|
|Post-login required acknowledgement (Ask user to confirm if they understand that the sunset is happening)|Can you explain what you mean here?|
|Aug: Begin blocking (modal to remind the user who is logging in with DS Logon to use ID.ME/Login.gov to login)|This isn’t something we’d been considering, it does mean that the Veteran would lose the opportunity to grandfather their account before DS Logon is actually sunset.|
|Sept: Remove DSL Button|No work done yet. But this will be something that happens. (Deadline is TBD)|
|Post-removal language|This is on sitewide content’s radar. As part of general content updates to the site to reflect changes will consider post removal language; [Ticket #53924](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/53924)|
