## Before the session

* Review the conversation guide to prepare. (This is linked in the meeting invitation).
* Log into your Zoom account. You may change your video conference display name to be just your first or preferred name. 
* Prepare yourself and your space for a video interview by clearing clutter (on screen and around you) and muting distractions like Slack notifications.
* Open the shared **observer Google Sheet** that was shared with you. (This is linked in the meeting invitation).
* Find the correct tab in the sheet, with the participant number, date and time of your session. (The participant number is in the title of the meeting invitation).

## At the start of the session

* Sign into the meeting and join the waiting room. During this time, the moderator will ask for the participant's consent to have you join the session. If the participant says no, the moderator will send you a message on Slack letting you know that you can leave.
* If the participant consents to you (and other observers) joining, the moderator will admit you to the meeting.
* Join the meeting with your **camera on** and **microphone muted**.
* The moderator will verbally introduce you and other observers, you can wave. If there's time, the moderator will ask you to say hello. Otherwise you can keep your **microphone muted**.
* Turn your **camera off** when the moderator says so.
* You will be a silent viewer the rest of the session with your **camera off** and **microphone muted**.

## Throughout the session

* Don't send messages in the Zoom chat. If you need to send a message to your team, use the study's specific DSVA Slack channel.
* Don't worry about taking perfect notes. We have people assigned to take notes, and we'll also receive a transcript after the call.
* Take note of things that you find particularly interesting, insightful, surprising or confusing.

### If something goes wrong

* The moderator's number one priority is to **keep the participant safe**.
* If a Veteran appears distressed, they will take a moment to check in with them, offer to move on and skip the question or topic, or they'll suggest taking a short break.
* If a Veteran continues to give signs of distress, the researcher will follow an emergency exit strategy that they have prepared for.
* If a Veteran experiences a medical or psychological emergency, then the researcher will follow [a protocol](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#Researchsafetyandemergencyexitstrategies-Requestingemergencyassistance) to request assistance.
* As an observer, it's also important to look after yourself during research. If you no longer feel safe or capable to continue taking notes, you should feel empowered to exit the call. The moderator will likely be distracted, but you can message to let them know you left. They will get in touch with you after the session finishes to check in.

## At the end of the session

* Continue to keep your **camera off** and **microphone muted** at the end of the session.

## After the session

* After the session, spend a couple minutes adding any other reflections or questions to your notes.
* Feel free to reach out to the researcher if you need to debrief further.
