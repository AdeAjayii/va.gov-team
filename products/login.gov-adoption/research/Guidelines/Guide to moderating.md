Last updated by @tygindraux: March 17, 2023

## Before the session

### Review VA Platform’s guidance

* [Conducting research sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/conducting-research-sessions#ConductingResearchSessions-Moderatingtips)
* [Research safety and emergency exit strategies](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Creatingasafespaceforparticipants)
* [Recording user research sessions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Recording-User-Research-Sessions.2050949305.html)

### Get set up for your session

* Log into the Perigean Zoom meeting (you will be the host)
* Turn on transcriptions by clicking the LIVE TRANSCRIPT button in the bottom toolbar, then, in the Live Transcription section, click the ENABLE button

## During the session

* We don’t require the Veteran to turn their camera on, but you should have your camera on as moderator.
* Remember to hit **record to cloud** after you confirmed the participant’s consent to being recorded.
* Leave space for the Veteran to share their questions, reactions and experiences. Don't be afraid to ask why and probe, to learn more.
* If someone asks you how something works or what happens when they click on something, remember that we're here to learn from them, not to teach or onboard them to a new product. It can help to say something like, "I'm wondering, how would you expect it to work?" instead of answering the question.
* When a Veteran shares a tough experience with you, show compassion but avoid unpacking trauma (which, as researchers, we're not prepared to do safely). It often helps to say something like, "I'm so sorry that happened to you" or "that sounds very frustrating," and then redirect back to your script or the purpose of the study.
* If you don't know the answer to something you can say something like, "I'm not sure. But I'll ask Perigean to share a link to the support line on VA.gov so you can contact the right person at the VA."

## After the session

### Debrief

* 

### Recordings

* Perigean will keep the recordings for up to 1 week following the study, Tyler will download any recordings needed and destroy the files once we’re done.
* Session recordings will not be posted to GitHub or Slack.
* Tyler will strip the video of PII or PHI if we decide to keep clips.
