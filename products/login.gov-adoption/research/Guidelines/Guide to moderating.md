### Getting set up for your session

* Log into the Perigean Zoom meeting (you will be the host)
* Turn on transcriptions by clicking the LIVE TRANSCRIPT button in the bottom toolbar, then, in the Live Transcription section, click the ENABLE button

## During the session

### At the start

* We don’t require the Veteran to turn their camera on, but you should have your camera on
* Remember to hit **record to cloud** after you confirmed the participant’s consent to being recorded

### At the end

* At the end of the session take a look at the feedback backchannel and see if anyone brought up questions that you need to address with your participant

## After the session

### Debrief

* 

### Recordings

* Perigean will keep the recordings for up to 1 week following the study, Tyler will download any recordings needed and destroy the files once we’re done.
* Session recordings will not be posted to GitHub or Slack.
* Tyler will strip the video of PII or PHI if we decide to keep clips.
