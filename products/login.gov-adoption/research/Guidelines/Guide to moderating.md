This guide is based:

## Before the session

* Review the conversation guide and prototypes (or other stimuli) to prepare.
* Log into the Perigean Zoom meeting (you will be the host).
* Turn on transcriptions by clicking the LIVE TRANSCRIPT button in the bottom toolbar, then, in the Live Transcription section, click the ENABLE button.
* Mute Slack notifications.

## During the session

* If the participant doesn't show up in the first few minutes, reach out to Perigean on Slack.
* Turn your camera on, but don't require the Veteran to turn their camera on.
* You can record the session if the participant gives you permission to record.
* Once you start recording, you must let the participant know they're being recorded and have them acknowledge that they give permission.
* Remember to hit **record to cloud** after you confirmed the participantâ€™s consent to being recorded.
* Leave space for the Veteran to share their questions, reactions and experiences. Don't be afraid to ask why and probe, to learn more.
* If someone asks you how something works or what happens when they click on something, remember that we're here to learn from them, not to teach or onboard them to a new product. It can help to say something like, "I'm wondering, how would you expect it to work?" instead of answering the question.
* When a Veteran shares a tough experience with you, show compassion but avoid unpacking trauma (which, as researchers, we're not prepared to do safely). It often helps to say something like, "I'm so sorry that happened to you" or "that sounds very frustrating," and then redirect back to your script. Remember that keeping to our [scope of practice](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/shared-support/trauma) helps us avoid causing additional harm to the Veteran.
* If you don't know the answer to something you can say something like, "I'm not sure. But I'll ask Perigean to share a link to the support line on VA.gov so you can contact the right person at the VA."

#### If something goes wrong

* Our number one priority as a researcher is to **keep our participants safe**.
* If a Veteran appears distressed, you can take a moment to check in, offer to move on and skip the question or topic, or suggest taking a short break.
* If they continue to give signs of distress, follow the emergency exit strategies in our conversation guide.
* If you find yourself in a session with a Veteran experiencing a medical or psychological emergency, then you need to follow [this protocol](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#Researchsafetyandemergencyexitstrategies-Requestingemergencyassistance) to request assistance.
* As the moderator, it's also important to look after yourself during research. If you no longer feel safe or capable to continue, pause the session by saying "I need to take a moment to set up the next task," get in touch with Perigean to describe the situation, and feel empowered to use an exit strategy from our conversation guide as soon as it feels necessary. After the incident, you should follow [this protocol](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#Researchsafetyandemergencyexitstrategies-Creatingasafespaceforresearchmoderators) and reach out to your research lead immediately.

## After the session

* We have scheduled debriefs throughout the research schedule. If you need to debrief more immeditately, reach out to your research lead.
* After the session, you can review notes and observations and add your own reflections while they're still fresh.
* Perigean will keep the recordings for up to 1 week following the study, your research lead will download any recordings needed and follow [these guidelines](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recording-user-research-sessions) to handle recordings safely.
