## Before the session

* Review the conversation guide and prototypes (or other stimuli) to prepare.
* Log into your Zoom account.
* Prepare yourself and your space for a video interview by clearing clutter (on screen and around you), ensuring you have good lighting, and muting distractions like Slack notifications.
* Open the shared notetaking Google Sheet that your research lead shared with you. (It's also in the meeting invitation).
* Find the correct tab with the participant number, date and time of your session. (The participant number should be in the title of the invitation sent to your calendar.)

## At the start of the session

* Join the meeting room and wait in the waiting room. During this time, the moderator will ask for the participant's consent to have you join the session. If the participant says no, the moderator will send you a message on Slack letting you know that you can leave.
* If the participant consents to you (and other observers) joining, the moderator will admit you to the meeting.
* Join the meeting with your **camera on** and **microphone muted**.
* The moderator will verbally introduce you and other observers, you can wave.
* Turn your **camera off** when the moderator says so.
* You will be a silent viewer the rest of the session with your **camera off** and **microphone muted**.

## Throughout the session

* You should aim to take (as near to as possible) verbatim notes. This means literally transcribing what the participant and moderator says and does. Something that seems unimportant could surface as a pattern after a couple of interviews, so we aim to capture everything.
* You should delay interpreting what's happening or jumping to solutions. For example, write, "The participant typed 'science fiction' in the search box." Instead of, "The participant can't find the task in the menu."
* Time stamp your notes every so often.
* Use a new line for each observation.
* Don't worry about typos or mistakes. If you miss something, don't stress. We can watch the recordings to fill in missing details as needed.

### If something goes wrong

* The moderator's number one priority is to **keep the participant safe**.
* If a Veteran appears distressed, they will take a moment to check in with them, offer to move on and skip the question or topic, or they'll suggest taking a short break.
* If a Veteran continues to give signs of distress, the researcher will follow an emergency exit strategy that they have prepared for.
* If a Veteran experiences a medical or psychological emergency, then the researcher will follow [a protocol](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-safety-and-emergency-exit-strategies#Researchsafetyandemergencyexitstrategies-Requestingemergencyassistance) to request assistance.
* As a notetaker, it's also important to look after yourself during research. If you no longer feel safe or capable to continue taking notes, you should feel empowered to exit the call. The moderator will likely be distracted, but you should message them to let them know. They will get in touch with you after the session finishes to check in.

## At the end of the session

* Keep your **camera off** and **microphone muted** even at the end of the session.

## After the session

* After the session you can go back through your notes and add details or decode acronyms, as needed.
* At the end of your notes, write your top 3-5 takeaways. These can be thing you found most interesting, insightful or surprising.
* If you have questions or comments for the researcher, add these after your key takeaways. Feel free to reach out to the researcher if you need to.

## At the end of the session

* Say thank you with intention. Remind the Veteran that our team couldn't do this work without their wisdom and help.
* Ask them how they are feeling. Give them time to debrief and use this time to transition out of the session.
* Inform participants of what they can expect next, including payment and further contact from you or Perigean.

## After the session

* We have scheduled debriefs throughout the research schedule. But if you need to debrief more immeditately, reach out to your research lead. It can help to reflect, particularly if you have a difficult conversation during a session.
* After the session, you can review notes and observations and add your own reflections while they're still fresh.
* Perigean will keep the recordings for up to 1 week following the study, your research lead will download any recordings needed and follow [these guidelines](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recording-user-research-sessions) to handle recordings safely.
