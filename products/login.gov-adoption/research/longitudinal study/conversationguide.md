## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes.
I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today marks the first session of a long term study where we will be discussing services that allow you to access your healthcare and benefits on VA.gov. Tdoday we're going to talk about a communication campaign that the VA is launching on changes to sign in services. During this workshop today, you will have opportunities to share your experiences with VA how you leverage support networks when interacting with its services. As we continue to work together in this study, there will be opportunities to co-create possible alternatives to ensure a smooth experience for yourself and fellow Veterans. Your participation today will not impact your ability to access VA services now or in the future.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 90 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability or evaluating your experience. We just want to understand your perspectives so that we can better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback. None of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know. You'll be compensated no matter how much of the session we complete.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Introductions - 5 minutes

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
