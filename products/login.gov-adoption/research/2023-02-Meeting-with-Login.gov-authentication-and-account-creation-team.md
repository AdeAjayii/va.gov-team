* How can we collaborate? What gaps can we fill in our knowledge, together?
* Next steps

## Overview of what Login.gov's working on

### Most recent research
#### Study about SMS as MFA, January 2023:
  * We just completed study in January
  * Recruited with Perigean
  * Main topic: SMS as MFA
  * But learned other things too about account creation, authentication, and MFA in general
  * Generated lots of follow up research questions and design exploration in coming sprints
  * Still finalizing reports, don’t have specific recommendations or roadmap implications (things to fix) yet
#### Another study, end of 2022:
  * Worked with the VA?
  * Similar findings
  * Still finalizing reports, don’t have specific recommendations or roadmap implications (things to fix) yet
  * Opened their eyes to people with disabilities and how they set up accounts
  * Wish: Want to do more screen reader research
  * Requested with Perigean, users self-identified, but learned later the users weren’t 'true' screen reader users

### Identified opportunity areas
* 1. Further differentiate between account creation and logging in: Many people go straight to login rather than account creation. They miss the button, even when prompted.
* 2. Password creation: More user friendly. So more people can pass through password creation.
* 3. Encouraging people to adopt 2nd MFA method. Many contact help desk: locked out, 1 method had failed.
* 4. Troubleshooting: In research they tested a happy path (MFA method worked) vs. sad path (didn’t). How would they troubleshoot?. Help them navigate once they run into blockers.

### Login.gov's questions for us
* To Tyler: Specific things from your research we should be aware of? Working with VA has been extremely useful. You know your users more than we might.

## Overview of what we've learned so far

### Most recent research
#### Discovery study, generative, December 2022: 
* Looked at entire account creation process.
* Assumptions: people would struggle with MFA setup.
* Found: MFA setup felt not as difficult as expected.
* Surprise: Experienced difficulty with passwords, both setup and using them over time.
* Most people would choose SMS for MFA, which we know.
* Also looked closely at security keys: VA wants to offer these as an MFA option.
* In discovery, learned: Most people won’t set up a security key unless prompted/recommended. Less familiar to people. They were open to using it as a backup option, but would need to have it recommended to them, and we’d need to onboard them to it.
* IAL1 flow - MFA is potentially the hard step. But feeling confident it might not be as risky as feared.

### Our questions for Login.gov
* Any research with folks less digitally connected? Our past participants have been more comfortable with tech. Thinking of running a study: severe cognitive disability, or unhoused Veterans. Those who are less digitally connected.
* Any thoughts on security keys? Research done?

## Discussion

### Passwords
* Login.gov: It wasn't a focus but insights observed in research, as part of account creation. Issues remembering passwords, password strength.
* Login.gov: Similar to what it sounds like you found, can you share findings with us?

### Security keys
* Login.gov: Study was on text & voice one-time codes. So heard opinions about security keys through that lens.
* Login.gov: “Text and voice is more convenient” or “I wasn’t given a security key.”
* Login.gov: Onboarding might be challenging.
* Login.gov: Participants were mobile-first: Security keys might need to work with mobile devices, not just desktops.
* Login.gov: Found that people love their phones, they’re easy. Texts come from friends and family all the time. Driving users to select phone as MFA method. But: Assume the phone won’t change or they won’t lose access. We can’t send you text messages if your number changed. Encourage a backup option. Might be security keys.
* Login.gov: Backup codes thought of as low-entry point (as a backup option). But if security keys were easy to provide: at health appointment? Might be a good way to bridge the challenge. Currently: Most users don’t know what it is and don’t have them.
* Login.gov: If you're learning about security keys, we'd be interested to see what you find.
* Login.gov: Also wondering, why are you specifically interested in security keys?
* VA: VA is interested in security keys as an option. Our team trying to learn whether it might be useful.
* VA: Our assumption: Might feel unfamiliar, they might not choose it. Changed question to: is this a good backup option? Can we give them out at health appointment? Good option for someone unhoused? Can be used at public library? Don't know answers yet.
* VA: Also, people assist Veterans & family who might need to get access. Security keys might work for non-Veteran roles. Share their account with that person. Tangibility of security key made the process make more sense for non-veteran users.

### Caregivers
* Login.gov: Caregiver has come up with some participants. People may share their accounts, or some participants rely on caregiver, official or unofficial. May have login issues.
* Login.gov: One participant with disability relied on someone who lived with them, but they weren’t always able to help with logging in - issues with their device.

### Participants in research
* Login.gov: Looked for self-reported cognitive disabilities, haven’t looked for unhoused Veterans with limited digital device access
* Login.gov: Other Veterans have suggested involving people who are unhoused.
* Login.gov: Haven’t successfully pulled them into research yet
* Login.gov: Did get people with cognitive disabilities, though - great data for us

### What's next for Login.gov
* Login.gov: Instead of specific solutions, doing large-scale design explorations of things found during research
* Login.gov: Want to ensure we’re not jumping right to solutions
* Login.gov: Interested in unhoused Veterans! We haven’t been able to study this. We’d love to collaborate on something like that.
* Login.gov: Team Ada works on identity verification (Princess’ team). Put teams together? One study instead of 3?
* VA: Amanda's in touch with Princess about setting something up.
* VA: Discuss potential for collaboration with John.

### Action items
* Login.gov: Can you provide VA personas or JTBD? 
* Login.gov: Any analytics you can share related to Login?
* VA: Will share analytics dashboard for migration when ready.
* VA: Amanda will connect with Ponja directly re: analytics for identity more generally.
* VA: Will share any findings on passwords from our study.
* VA: Stay in touch! Will reach out to discuss potential for collaboration on less-digitally connected Veterans study. Maybe around April.
