# Extra information for Perigean to share with Veterans ahead of time

## Who you’ll meet with

You will meet with Tyler. She’s a designer and researcher for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

In addition, Tyler might ask to bring along a few colleagues. They will sit quietly, listening and taking notes. They'd like to join because it helps them learn from the research, too. But, it's up to you whether they are allowed to join. At the start of your session, Tyler will again ask you if it's okay for others to join.

## Why the VA is doing this research

The VA wants to improve the experience for Veterans when they login to VA.gov, eBenefits or My HealtheVet. This research will help them receive feedback and ensure any changes they make work well for Veterans.

## What you will do during the session

This research session will last up to 1 hour on Zoom. 

You’ll be asked to use a prototype, which is like a test version of the VA.gov website. While you click through the prototype, Tyler will ask you questions about your experience and receive your feedback.
