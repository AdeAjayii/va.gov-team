00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So you'll have to bear with me.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Alright! So are you comfortable with me recording this session today, John?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I am.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Okay, awesome. Thanks. So much. Alrighty. So I've started the recording.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I think we can get started if that sounds good for you.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Absolutely.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Okay. So I think to start, I'd just like to learn a little bit more about your experience with the Va.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And some of our online services. Like I said, we're specifically interested in that kind of sign in process.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'm gonna start by just asking a couple questions about that.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Okay.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
So I know a little bit more about your experience. How long have you been a veteran? By the way?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I serve 25 years in the Air Force.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Okay. And when did you become a veteran?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In August of 2020 is, whenever.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
No!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Okay. Okay, so not too long ago. And how often have you been going online to manage your PA benefits or your healthcare?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Okay.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You know, I would say, maybe once every 6 months at this point most retirement it was probably weekly, but now that everything's pretty much been established from healthcare to dependent education benefits things that nature, it's really just maintenance and just

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
checking out on things here and there.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Yes.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Yeah, that makes sense. So you said about every 6 months or so right now, do you remember the last time that you signed in online?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
For the my healthy bet I well, I signed in this morning just to kinda make sure I knew my password, and I'm on my work computer.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And usually I use my personal device. But I mean this morning. But prior to then I would say, maybe 2 months ago.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Okay. And you said you signed into my healthy vet this morning.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Yes.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Is my healthy vet, usually the website that you're going to when you're trying to do something related to the Va.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Yes, primarily, just because now I think it's just like setting up medical appointments so that's usually the one I go to.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The most.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
That makes sense. And do you remember when you're signing into my healthy vet?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I guess you did it this morning, so you might have a good memory of it.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Do you? Can you describe to me which way that you sign in?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So I just go to the my healthy bed website.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And then I use the my help. You bet login!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Okay. And do you remember? Like, I guess, why you set up the my healthy vet login, or how come?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
That's the one you're deciding to use.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I don't remember. Honestly, I think I think it may. May it just been the easiest.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The easiest to set out.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Yeah against, you know, versus using the Ds login, for I think id me is the other one. Maybe.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Okay, yeah. Do you have any of the other sign-in setup as well?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Yes, so the Ds login I use for that's like my retirement pay, and things like that.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Nature do d fast that you know that in order to login you have to have a much more extensive username and password.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So I have that kind of stored in my personal laptop, and then the the real id I have that.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But I just use it mainly, for, like those those companies that use get military discounts a lot of times, they may are you to log in to real Id. So I don't really know why I chose my healthy event.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I think it. I think it may have also been like a requirement from not mistaken.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:47.000
They wanted to create some sort of an account. When you enrollment Va. Benefits.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Hmm!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Right? Okay, yeah, I think it's common for people when you're going through the like eligibility and enrollment process for healthcare to be introduced to my healthy bed.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Yeah.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So yeah, that'll make sense. And that's helpful to understand why you're using different signs for different things.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So, I think. Is there anything else you wanted to share with me about that before we move on?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
No, I think that's it.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Okay, well, let's go ahead and get started.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I mentioned that we were going to be using a prototype today.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Okay.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Okay.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Sure!

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So what I'm gonna do is I'll send you a link in in the zoom chat here, and then I would just love if you can open this up on on your end and then I'm gonna ask you to share your screen with me.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So if there's anything that you wanted to like, you know, minimize, or whatever on your screen.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Okay.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Now I'll give you a second to do that while I send the link in the chat.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And then, once you got that link, are you familiar with sharing your screen?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Yeah, I use teams every day. So I just gotta find it here on.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Okay, yeah, on zoom, it's it's at the bottom, and it's green.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Yeah, perfect.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Okay, share screen. Got it here.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
So can you see that now?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Yeah, that's perfect. So now I can see the ba.co website on your screen.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And then I can also see it looks like you've got the my helping that website up.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Is that right?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Oh, yeah. I moved it from one screen to the next.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
So I believe it here. I guess it'll be better.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Okay, yeah, absolutely. No. That's fine.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Okay, yeah, is that okay, does that work for you? Okay, okay, perfect.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Awesome, so we're looking at the Va Gov homepage right now.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And what I would like for us to do today is imagine that you just went online because let's say that you needed to access some information, or you were, you know, gonna refill a prescription or something like that.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Yeah.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Okay. And the first thing that you needed to do was to sign in. So can you tell me what you would do first if you were signing in?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Oh, yeah, I would just go to the sign in button, my username and password, and then attempt to go to whatever whatever actually benefit I was gonna use setup, an appointment, you know, like the records or education.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Okay, well, let's go ahead and click sign in.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Yes, absolutely.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Yes.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Does this page look familiar to you? And you mentioned that usually you'll choose to use my healthy that particularly because it feels a bit easier to use.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Yes.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Than the id dot me or Ds log one yeah, that's helpful.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Yes.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So first today, what I'm gonna have you do is click on Ds log on.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
We know that you have a Ds log on account setup.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
It sounds like you're using it to manage your retirement.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Yes.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And and things of that nature. Okay, so we're gonna pause here now.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So we've signed in with Dslog on.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This is perfect and we're seeing something kind of on this screen.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Can you describe to me what you're seeing on the screen right now?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Yeah, it's asking me whether or not I have a Ds login account, or if I need to create one.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Okay. And so you're seeing kind of a pop-up.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Let's say that's asking you if you have a Dslog on account, or what?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Or if you need to create one that's helpful.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Yes.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So I'm gonna give you a second to read this in a little more detail.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Now, so I'll be quiet for a second, and then what I'd like for you to do after that is just summarize what you've read for me.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Okay.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
This is basically saying that, that from my understanding, Ds login, it's gonna stop working.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And you can create a Va healthcare login using the same, using a package.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Yeah. And basically, the information is just gonna merge. So you don't need to verify yourself all over again.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Okay. Great. That's really helpful. So it sounds like Ds logon is gonna be going away.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And you're gonna need to set up a Va healthcare account and your information is going to be sent over.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So you're not going to need to verify your identity again.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Correct.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:25.000
That's very helpful. And so, as someone who uses Ds log on to manage retirement information and maybe other things, what's your reaction to what you're reading right now?

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I mean doesn't surprise me. I mean, you know, throughout my 25 years of military the the way you log in to some of the secure portals changes regularly as a veteran now, and no longer having like access to a card card.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000
It's a I'm not gonna say like it's troublesome, but it's just like, okay.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Now I have well, the assumption would be. Now I have to create a whole new login and password.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But it did say it was gonna merge. But now you know to me it's like, well, now, I have to remember a new way to Login as opposed to in the past.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Where you go to the website. And you have the 4 or 5 options to choose from.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.000
As to how you're gonna get into the system. So I'm assuming the Ds login will go away.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And now what would reflect the the Va login.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Right? Okay, so that's really helpful. So during your time in the military, this kind of asked to set up a new login, wasn't you know, it was kind of common.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Yeah.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So you're sort of not surprised, but because you're now a veteran, and you're using systems kind of in a different way.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Yeah.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It's a little bit more annoying. Maybe, because now you're gonna have to set up something and remember something, etc.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Correct.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Yeah, that makes sense to me. And this Va, only account, can you tell me a little bit more about what you're imagining?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
This this new sign in that you might set up to be.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I would imagine that it's just like one stop shopping for all things.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Va, I mean, it matches the healthcare and benefits, so I would assume you go to this one login and at that one pages where you can set up a Va. Appointment.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
You can look at your big benefits maybe browser additional services at the BA.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Offers just a login that allows you to access all things.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Via without having to go to multiple different notes or sites.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Okay? And when you see, like multiple different pages or sites, can you give me maybe an example of what's coming to mind for you?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Yeah, I remember, you know, when I was transitioning to retirement and just trying to get access to the Va.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Benefits and healthcare and disability. It just seem like I had to go through so many different channels and it wasn't like it wasn't all at one place, you know.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It felt like I had to use this website and click on this link and that links send me to another link and then another link, you know, and then it just seemed like it was a it was a a labyrinth, you know, to get to where I need to be as opposed, to one website.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.000
That may just have healthcare education services, and whatever else you click on, it takes you right there.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Right? Okay, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. I think a labyrinth is maybe a good way of describing it.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And so there's a lot of jumping around. There's different websites there's different sign-in methods.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I think that's all making sense. And so you're kind of reading this message here to say that maybe that will be begin to kind of consolidate things.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Yes.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And so there's one place where you would be able to access that information.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Yeah, that.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Yeah, I also mistaken, too. I think I remember like I would log in to some secure port.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Let's say I log in with Ds login.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:12:01.000
And then I try to access the Va. Benefits. It would then have me log into the Va's not I use my Va credentials essentially the Login, so you know, if I'm already logging in using one secure website.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It was, it would make sense to me so automatically give you access to the other site as opposed to having, you know, happen to identity.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
You know, we identify yourself once again.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Right? Gotcha. Okay? So sometimes you might be on my healthy that.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
But you need to access your things on benefits or something, and you're gonna have to sign in twice.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Yes.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Yeah, I got you. Okay, that makes sense. So that's really helpful.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And I think, is there anything else in this message here that is sticking out to you?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We talked a little bit about Dslog on going away, and about this Va.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Only sign in methods.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
No, nothing else that.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Okay. And so when we see kind of these different options, I guess for things that you might click if you were browsing this in your own time, what do you imagine that you would do in this moment, you've come online, you need to complete some task like a message your doctor, and then you see

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
this come up, what do you think would happen? Realistically?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Realistically, I would probably forget my maybe the password or something, then have to recreate the password.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:23.000
But on a good day I would just you know, go to continue with, continue with, I guess it's gonna be called the Va.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Va, digital tools, login, something along those lines.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And then I would put in my username and password hopefully gain access on the first attempt.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Okay. Gotcha. So you're looking for something to say.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Yeah.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Like. Continue and set up your Va. Only account, and we've got a couple of different.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Let's call them links here, and I'll just give you a second to look more closely at these links and let me know if either of them or any of them are things that you would think to click on next.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Okay? And is, am I looking for those in the chat?

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
No, just on this screen here. So inside this kind of white box.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Okay. Okay.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty self explanatory whether I find doing it for the first time. I need to create a login, or if I already have one, didn't just go with continue with log on. For now.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Okay, great. So for today, what we're gonna do is continue to create.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Sorry I shouldn't have used the word. Continue, we're gonna create a login Gov account. So I'm gonna let you click on that.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Okay, perfect. So if we were creating a login.gov account, what would we?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
What would you do next on this page?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Now click on, create an account button.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Go ahead and click on that.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Alright. No. So for today you will not have to fill out the information.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000
We'll just kind of continue, and I'm imagine that you're doing it.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
So many, yeah.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So on this screen is anything jumping out at you? Is it feeling straightforward?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Can you maybe tell me how you would be filling this out?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty clean and simple. I would just enter my email address, select my preferred language, and then I mean, usually I don't read out the rules of use.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
But click on the box and hit. Continue.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So I think for today, we'll click on that box that I read and accept and then we'll click on.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Continue, and we'll continue to imagine we're setting up this account.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Okay.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So let me know what you're seeing on this screen here.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
It's basically saying that that it has received the information.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I inputted and it needs me to verify the email address.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
So now I would like check email. And it does. It looks like it.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Some sort of verification email will go to Martha at Gmail.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
That will allow, confirm that I actually did create the account.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Okay, this, sounds like something that you might be familiar with. Okay, great.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Yes, absolutely.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
So let's click on check email, and we'll continue.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:01.000
We're obviously not gonna open up your own email today.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Yeah.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
So this would be, maybe the email that you're receiving in order to confirm is this looking familiar so far?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Yes.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Okay. And when you're doing something like this, let's say, you know, you're sitting on your desktop.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I think you said you're on your work computer right now.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000
If you were setting this up, and you were on your desktop or work computer, how would you confirm your email?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Would that be on your computer as well?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Yeah yeah, probably a computer or cell phone. I mean, I had.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:34.000
You know, I think most people have their personal email address link to their cell phone, gmail app, or the mail app.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:42.000
I'll use an iphone, and then probably my cell phone because again, it's already I'm already logged into it all you have to hit the mail button.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And then I would actually see that email. I would confirm there and then see if I have access.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Okay, great. So you might be working through this account creation on your computer.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000
And then check your email on your phone and then would you continue the rest of the process on your phone?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Or would you come back to your computer?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
No, I I would use the computer.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Okay. Great. That's really helpful. Let's go ahead and click.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Confirm email, address.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Absolutely.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Alright. Is this page looking familiar? Okay, do you have any kind of thoughts? When you see a a page asking you to create a password?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:28.000
No, I mean, I usually use the same sequence to create a password usually and I'll use 6 capital letters 6.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:39.000
6 lowercase letters, and then some number and symbol configuration is just. Maybe it's the same by an hour.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Next to it. Yeah, but it looks me looks very common.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Okay, okay, great. So you're familiar with setting up passwords.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:52.000
You kinda have a model in your head for how you might go ahead and build that password.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Yes.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Yeah, that's perfect. So let's click on.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Continue, and we'll we'll continue to set up this account.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Alrighty, so let me know what you're seeing on this page.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Based in authentication setup so multi factor.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Authentication is pretty common nowadays, I guess, especially for some of these secure sites.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
It. You have to go to, and so it gives. It's giving you multiple options whether you want to do face or touch security key using id of some sort.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Or government, id authentication, app text or voicemail, or backup codes.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Okay, so this kind of similarly to that verifying your email address, this feels like something you're familiar with.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Yeah.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
You said it. It's kinda common these days. Can we go through this list?

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:52.000
And you can just kind of let me know whether this is something you would or wouldn't set up, and maybe why. So we can start wherever you want to start on that list.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Yeah, I mean immediately. I probably go to the text of voice message, probably because 90%, 99% of the other sites that I go to that require multi factor authentication.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Again. I usually have my cell phone on me. So the text is easiest.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:22.000
I can click on that button. Look at my phone, get the 6 digit code, or whatever it is, type it in, and then continue on the website.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Yeah.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.000
I've never used like face or touched on lock, but like my iphone your face id security security key, I mean, I wouldn't use that, especially as a better, and I don't have like security, you know, encrypted keys laying around the office.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Of I guess if I was a civilian government employee, maybe I would have a cat card that would give me access to Dod or government computer systems, authentication app.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I mean, I use one for work. I think I have.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:58.000
The Microsoft authenticator. For some of the sites I need to go to, but again, that's strictly for the work related purposes.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:06.000
So text of voice. Probably the best text, 99% of the time, and then backup codes.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Okay.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
I've never seen that one before. Melissa Tinco.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
That's the same way to too much.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Yeah, okay, that was really helpful. So it sounds like, text was a pretty obvious choice for you.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Yeah.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And then if you were gonna set up a backup method, let's say, do you see?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Yeah.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Kind of a good backup option for you on the list.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.000
I guess maybe the authentication app, because again, I have Microsoft authenticator.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Yeah.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:47.000
When I usually what I'm accessing work sites from my cell phone occasionally every my user in my pastword is stored.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000
But I would say maybe once every 2 weeks in it like requires me to re authenticate myself on my cell phone.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.000
I'm assuming. As some sort of security, you know, security factor.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:05.000
But so I would think probably authentication app second would be a backup, just because that time to have to use that as well.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Okay, yeah, that makes a lot of sense let's go ahead and click on text.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Or voice message, and then we'll we'll continue and set that one up.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Alright, so let me know what you're seeing here.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:27.000
It's just basically getting me to say that I'm getting ready to input my phone number, which will then send the code to my cell phone number.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
And then I received it. I'm assuming I'll receive the code as a text.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
I'll put that code in, and then it will allow me to process one side, authenticate myself.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Okay, awesome. Yeah, sounds like, something you're familiar with.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Yeah.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
And and you kind of have an expectation for how it will go.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Let's pretend like we're sending that code.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Good.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Okay.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000
So you know, you put your phone number in, and then I suppose you might need to choose text message for the the page to continue.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:03.000
So just above send code yeah, I think you might have to click on that.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
I think it's highlighted now.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Yeah, huh, yeah, yeah, perfect. Okay, there we go. Alrighty.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
So on this page. It looks like this is where we're entering that code that you just described.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:19.000
So we'll go ahead and click, submit, and then we'll continue through alrighty.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:27.000
So what is the screen telling you?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Okay.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
That successfully accomplish the first authentication method. Now it's asking if I would like to create a second.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Umhm, alright and realistically. What do you think you would choose to click next on this screen?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
I probably skip it, for now.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Okay, awesome. Let's go ahead and skip it, for now.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
And then let me know what you're seeing here.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Basically, my account is complete. It shows me the email address that I've used to set the account.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:03.000
And that would be all. Use the information to connect to your account, and then I would have to agree to be able to move on.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Okay, perfect. And what kind of account do you think you just set up?

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
If you can describe that to me.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:19.000
The new login for the Va. That the system has going to replace or take place of the Ds. Login.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Okay, perfect. And do you have any questions when you're reading anything on this screen?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
No pretty good itself. Explanatory.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Okay? And when you click a green, continue, what are you expecting to happen on the next?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:38.000
That I have access to that. I would see Page set hopefully.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Would be similar to that of what I would see following the Login through Dsl Login, or my healthy bed, or verify me.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Okay, so it feels like, after you click a green. Continue, you're gonna end up like where you would have ended up if you signed in with a different sign in method.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Yes.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Okay, that's helpful. So let's click on a and continue.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
And then I'm gonna give you a second to kinda look around this page.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:19.000
We won't click anything yet, and then we can talk a little bit about what you're seeing.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Well, first, it's just telling me that, did login with login.gov, and that I can use login that go for all V digital tools.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Oh, cause, I currently have a Va Login account. If I wanted to use the account for other government websites I'll need to go back to login.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Dot gov to verify my identity. So I think that's like what I was referring to when I first created these.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
These access to the different sites, to go from one to the other.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
It will require me to reverify myself.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Okay, Gotcha. Okay? So is anything that you're reading here surprising you, I guess, from what you were expecting you were you were setting up.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Yeah, I mean that my first thought it's just that, you know.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Okay, not like. It's almost like frustrating, like.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Now, I got it now I'll have to. We verify myself if I want to go to another site.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.000
After I went through all that to get to the secure site.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Right? Right? Okay. So you kind of went into this process thinking, all right, like, I guess Dslagon's going away.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000
But at least this method is gonna mean that I don't have to continue to verify myself on all these different.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
My healthy vet benef benefits va.gov.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Yeah.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
And now you're being told that you might need to do that.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Yes.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Okay, yeah. And when you're reading it says, other government websites, is that what you're imagining you're imagining like my healthy vet, E benefits these other different websites that you use to access.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Yes, absolutely.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Va, related things. Okay, yeah, that's perfect. And when you see a verify your identity, what does what does that mean to you?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Can you describe that in your own words?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:13.000
I probably need to put some sort of, you know key indicator, like date of birth, or last 4 years social or I mean, that thing has seen like verify your discharge date.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:21.000
So some sort of identifier that's related specifically to me.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000
That allows the system to know that if I have that information, you know more than likely it's me.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Okay, yeah. Gotcha. So putting in some kind of string of information that might be, yeah, like a unique identifier, let's say, and that would be part of signing in.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Is that how you're imagining that?

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Yeah, I I would imagine to probably the like that second authenticator.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Probably I mean usually, if I remember correctly, if I let's say I click on a link in this site to go to benefits, it would probably ask me to login using 3 or 4 choices, whether it's ds login, you know id me, or whatever the case, may be and then I

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:17.000
would soon the second. The second step would also be a an authenticator which would be some sort of personal identifier.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Okay. Gotcha, alright. And so if we were looking at this screen and you wanted to kind of, I guess. Continue on.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:39.000
And message your doctor like's say, do you know how you would kind of click where you would click in order to start that process?

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Okay.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
I mean, first, I would close out. I would, in order to get to the page I would need to close this out, and then I've never.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:52.000
I've never had to send a message to my doctor, but now I clearly see here where it says, send a secure message to your healthcare team.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Okay, yeah, that's helpful. So it seems pretty obvious to you how to kinda close out of that popup.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Yeah.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Yeah.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
And then you're maybe less familiar with sending a message to your doctor, and and might have been on my healthy vet instead of va.gov.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000
But it still was pretty obvious how you might continue on with that task.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Yeah, awesome. So what we're gonna do now is if you scroll up to the top, you can just click anywhere in that kinda dark top of the screen.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Okay.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Yeah, that's perfect. So this is back, we're back on the Va Gov homepage now, and we're no longer signed in this kind of scenario.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
And so what I want us to do now is kind of imagine that it's a couple.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Why don't we say a couple of months?

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
It's a couple months after you had signed in to va.gov.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:50.000
With Ds log on, and you'd set up this new login method, and you're coming back to the Va.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Hmm!

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Gov, because you need to do another task. So we're gonna sign in again.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
So I'm gonna let you click to sign in which you felt familiar with.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:58.000
And then we're gonna say on this page for a second.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:09.000
So which method would be be using a couple months later, after we had set up this new account, what do you think you would be choosing to sign in with?

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000
The login.gov.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Okay. Can you tell me why that is?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Because I would have a remember that I had to create a Login Gov account.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Get to basically to access it. The previous time that I was in in the site.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Yeah, that makes sense. And when you're seeing like, you still see the option for Ds Logon, for example, why do you think that is?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Maybe the government is just slow, and haven't had the opportunity to remove the homepage.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Maybe.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So you feel like, it's gonna be removed.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Yes.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.000
It just hasn't been removed yet, and you're gonna start using login.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Okay. And I know that you have id dot me you mentioned, and you also have my healthy vet.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
What would make you choose to use login? Go, gov.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Instead of using id dot me, or myhealthy, that.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
It. I mean, maybe it's the first option.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:22.000
It does kind of stick out to me more than the others with the red background on the white, you know.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Text, I mean, that may sound silly, but it is kind of like it jumps out ahead of the other one.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
So maybe I would just say, Oh, yeah, I remember login that go and just click on that one.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Okay, okay, yeah, that makes sense. And let's say, you know, on this day you were like, Oh, shoot!

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.000
I know I have a logging Gov account. I can't remember my password for that one.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
What would you do on this page?

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
More than likely I would try to log in to one of the others, just because I think it'd be easier to see if I can get access through.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Probably my healthy bed, instead of having to go through the, you know, forgot password and all that kind of stuff.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:17.000
It seems like I probably would. I would. I think, that I would have a better chance of gaining access, using one of my other logins that happen to go through the steps to, you, know, recover your password, or recover your login and things of that nature.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So it's almost you almost would use it as kind of like a backup method.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Yeah.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Right? Okay, cool. Let's click on login.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Gov, and we'll continue to this screen.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:38.000
And so if you were seeing something like this, remembering like, it's a couple months later, when you'd set up your account, what do you think you would be doing next?

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:50.000
I would attempt to log in, you know, with my signing password, I would hope that I would hope that there's an option for me to store it.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
I mean, usually with these sites, you know you can. Once once you have logged in, you know it gives you an opportunity to save it in the system.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:12.000
So usually it doesn't automatically properly. I think a lot of times when I click on it, it, when I click on it populates.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Or once I put my email address. Then, like the system itself, would have the little password store thing.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Pop, say like, is this, is this set you want to login? I'm sorry.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Yeah.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Just 1 s.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Yes, go ahead. Sorry my 80 roles won a banana so.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Absolutely.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
No worries, awesome. So it sounds like having the password, the email address and password kind of stored in one of those password manager things would be helpful for you because you could just kind of auto populate this and then continue yeah, cool all right let's

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
click, on sign in. And for today, we're not going to go through all that Mfa.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
And everything that we would need to do with signing in.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:23.000
So we see this screen now, so I'll give you a second to read this.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Basically saying that.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:32.000
I wanna access the site outside of going through the Va.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Then I would need to go through a bunch of steps to bear my identity, to get that full access.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
It would take approximately 20 min, and I would need a state issue.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Id so and be able to provide my phone number.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Okay. So when, when it's saying full access, or when you're imagining what full access means, can you describe to me what that is?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:09.000
I guess I I wouldn't imagine again it would allow me to gain access to medical education.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.000
You know any additional services that they offers?

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Yeah.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
So I I would hope it would almost go back to that.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:29.000
That screen. I referenced earlier, like that one stop shopping where everything is at one place, and you don't have to go digging for the information that you need.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Yeah, gotcha, okay? And is anything that you're reading here, confusing?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000
No, it's more frustrating than confusing but again, I think it's like, Oh, here we go! Another 20 min.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Say, create a whole another account. But no, I don't think it's, you know.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
It's it's pretty self explanatory.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Yeah, okay. And it's saying that you need. You know, you need 20 min.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
And you're gonna have to bring these, you know, state Id and a social security number.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
And your phone number in order to verify your identity.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
We talked a little bit about verifying your identity earlier.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Is this a kind of a different way that you're understanding, verifying your identity?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Yeah, I mean, it definitely says, state issue, id social security number.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:24.000
You see it here? I will, I guess I should say, usually like your last 4 of your social, that the whole entire social security number does seem different.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
But the phone number, I mean, I I don't know.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:32.000
I'm assuming the phone number would be like to send you a text message.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:44.000
I don't think any system could verify based on your number solely as if you know their cross-referencing Verizon, or something like that.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Yeah.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.000
So, yeah, so it's definitely different. Because now it's asking for a state issue.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Id your full social security number and your cell phone number or 8 phone.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Yeah, okay. And so what would motivate you to do something like this to continue and verify your identity instead of maybe saying, No, thanks. I don't want to do this.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Honestly, I'm not sure. I mean I would definitely say no, thanks, I don't want to verify if there was like some.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:22.000
If there was a us. You know what a portion of a site something within the Va.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
That I have to gain access to. Any required. This, then I would, you know.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Then I feel like I would be forced to, but I don't think I would do it, you know, voluntarily.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Yeah, okay, cool. So you'd need this to be almost like mandatory in order to say, Yeah, okay, I have to do this.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Absolutely.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
I'll do it. Yeah, okay, that's really helpful.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:44.000
So you'd probably click on. No, thanks. I don't want to verify.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Yes.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Okay, perfect and not very verifying your identity.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Right now it. Do you have any kind of concerns or hesitations about how that would or wouldn't maybe affect what you need to do with the Va.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:09.000
No, I mean from my understanding when I read it initially.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:16.000
It's telling me I'm I would need to do this to gain access outside of the Va's portal.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
So I I don't see why I would need to gain access.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:26.000
You know why I would personally need to go outside of the portal the Va's portal, if I have the BA.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Access. You know. Why, would be the whole other account.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:37.000
And you know, why would I need it to? Why would I need to access any of that information outside of the normal page?

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Right? Okay, so, you're not really understanding like what you would need outside of the Va.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000
And so therefore it's like, why would I set up this account?

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Yes.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Yeah, that's perfect already. I think we can go ahead and close the prototype so you can stop sharing your screen if you would like to perfect.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
So we've talked a lot today I've asked you a lot of questions.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:14.000
I just want to spend a couple minutes reflecting before we wrap up. So if you can just tell me in your own words what what you have just done today, what did we do when we went through that prototype?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
I would say that we just went through the steps.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Well, we we went to the steps to create the new login that's going to take place of one of the previous points of access and.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:39.000
In order to gain that access, we had a create a new account, but I mean, I know the information did say it should merge over.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
But yeah, basically, we just went through the steps to bear.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:53.000
It was made aware to me that they're gonna go away with one of one of the access points, and I would need to create a new login.gov account.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Okay, yeah, that means so it it was obvious, at least by the end of the process, that thes log on was going away.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Yes.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:13.000
And so this is why you were creating a login account, and we talked a little bit, or you mentioned and we haven't really talked about that merging of of accounts so like some of your information was being merged.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
What does that mean to you? What were you expecting?

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
I guess when you first read that.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
I guess my expectations would be once I gain.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Once I created the account and gain access. All of my previous.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:37.000
You know education benefits medical disability, you know. I would assume that would have already merged into this.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:49.000
The new portal, you know. So while creating a new login for the portal, my information once I gain access and authenticated myself.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.000
My, all, my personal information would already have been Internet, like, like basically merge into that system. So.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So any healthcare data or anything like that is gonna be shared.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.000
So you're not gonna have to like lose all this information just because Ds log on's going away.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Yes.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Okay. Gotcha. And did that feel like that was clear?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
That had successfully happened. By the end of the process.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Not necessarily. I mean, I think I gained access.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
You know, but I don't. I don't. I didn't think through that piece, but I mean nothing like stood out.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:35.000
This said, you know you have officially no, I don't even really know how to explain it. You know.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000
I guess it's something that popped up to say, like, you know it.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000
You have successfully logged in, you know you.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
You now have access to your information, or you know, education, whatever.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Whatever, however, is, gonna list it but thing if it you know, once you once I logged in and I got the successful.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
You know the green popup, whatever it was, maybe something that would have said.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
You know I I now have full access to my information.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
It would sit out more than just really. I just made an assumption that it did.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
You know I don't remember seeing anything confirmation that it did.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Yeah. And would you say, that's like a really important part of like, your willingness to set up the account was knowing that your information would be transferred over.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Yeah, I mean reading it, you know, was and provide some comfort that I wouldn't have to go through.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Assuming I won't have to go through a whole other 1,000 steps, you know, to finally gain access to the admission that I needed.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
But you know again, if you sort of just make an assumption, because I never saw all that information.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Right? Gotcha. Okay? So it felt like for me, just watching you go through the process.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:53.000
There was kind of some ups and downs throughout it, like a little bit like at the beginning.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:14.000
It felt like, okay, maybe this means I'm not gonna have to sign in on these different websites and this is going to like kind of merge.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Yes.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Everything together, and then by the end it felt a little bit like you were realizing that that might not be true, and you might need to actually continue to verify your identity, to have access to other websites do you think that's a fair kind of reflection.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Yes, absolutely.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Okay. And I just wanted to confirm throughout the process we talked about a couple of different sign-in methods that you already have, like, currently setup and I know you've got id dot me, which you kind of use for those discounts.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Yeah.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Especially you've got sorry Ds log on to access retirement information, and then you've got my healthy.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
That which sounds like you use quite commonly for Va.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Hmm!

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Kind of healthcare and stuff. Did you already have a login.gov account setup?

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Not that I don't think so.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Okay. Cool. That's how I remembered the conversation.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
But I just wanted to confirm so that's helpful.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
I think you know, I think we've covered all my questions.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
So I do. Wanna give you a chance to ask me a couple of questions.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.000
If you do have any.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:13.000
No, I don't happen. I think this I don't think you know the allowing veterans to provide their input.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Into these sort of, you know, new process of procedures.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.000
I think it's I think it's great.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Yeah, I think it's it's hard for us to convey how much help that it gives us.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:30.000
I think it'd be really, really hard to do our jobs if we didn't have input from yourself and from other veterans.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Yeah.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Because there's just so many things that we're not noticing that you've picked up on today that that will be really helpful for us.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Yeah, absolutely.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Absolutely great.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
So, yeah, I appreciate your time a lot, and I know the rest of the well.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Thanks so much, John. I do want to reassure you that everything that we were looking at is kind of like in in testing.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Okay.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
We're not exactly sure what changes will will be made, so I don't want you to feel confident you can continue to access things as you as you have been, for now I think that's mostly it.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:12.000
I said, your feedback actually helpful. I do want you to know that per pair, Jian.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.000
The folks that set up the interview that you were speaking to earlier.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Okay.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:33.000
They're going to be the ones that manage paying you. So if you have any questions about that, feel free to and I think they're also gonna send you a note asking for you to pass this along to other veterans in case they wanted to sign up, and do something similar to what

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Okay.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000
you've done, but I think that's it, and we give you a little bit of time back as well.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:44.000
GreatYou too.
