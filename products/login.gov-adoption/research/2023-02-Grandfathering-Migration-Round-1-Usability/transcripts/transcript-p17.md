00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So let me just do that.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Okay, perfect. So I have started the recording. And I just wanna confirm that you're comfortable.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If I record my screen and the audio as we talk to me.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Yeah, I wanna got it. Yeah, that's fine.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Okay, okay, perfect. And throughout the session if you can't hear me or there's any issues with volume again, you just let me know.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay. I can always start yelling a little bit alright.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Very good. Okay.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So let's start by learning a little bit more about you and your experience with the Va.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And particularly with some of our online services. How long have you been a veteran, Kontos?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I, I was drafted 1968, went to Ocs.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Became an officer and let a combat infiltrate platoon in Vietnam, 70 and 71.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I love you, the Gi. Bill, to go to school and I didn't know I had Ptsd.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Okay.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Until some 25 years after the war, and what happened was I was my wife had a traumatic brain injury, and I became the principal caregiver, and so the stress from that, plus the Ptsd kind of did me in and so I had to see Cal and I went out

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Okay.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
on disability. So I guess it's since 19 2,009.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Okay.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Uhhuh, yeah. I've been involved with the Va.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Okay, thank you. That's really helpful. So it sounds like you've been a veteran for a couple of years now, and you were in the service for a while.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That's helpful to know a little bit more about your background and your experience.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Yeah.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And what about going online? When did you start going online to manage things like your healthcare, for example, with the Va.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I was reluctant. I didn't like to do zoom, and I've only recently been doing zoom recent last 4, 5 months.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:18.000
But I could go online to order my prescription and to have comments to my principal caregiver and other people at the Va.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Hospital in Philadelphia. So, and then the check at my appointments and things like that.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But not have meetings like this. I have had conferences over the phone with people at the Va. Hospital.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
That's the extent of it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Okay, okay, so a little bit of reluctance about kind of starting to do some of these things online.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But you do have some experience messaging your doctor and doing things like that.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Sounds like. And what about signing in? We talked a little bit when you joined about issues you have.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Yeah.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Do you want to tell me a little bit more about that?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Yeah, I. For some reason I cannot use the recommended sign in.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I'm not even sure is that Ds. I think it's called.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Is is that what they, the recommended? Okay, but I used id dot me id, and that's fine.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I have a something that keeps all of my passwords together.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So I go there. I type in Id and make sure. Remind me what the password is, and then that works fine.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So I use that to go on the the Va website.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And so it's sounds like, Id, dot, me is working well for you, and particularly because you can save your password inside that password manager.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Yes, yes.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And when you joined you said that you tried to set up login.gov.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Do you think login.gov is the one you're trying to think of right now?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You, said Ds. But I'm just trying to make sure I'm understanding.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Yeah, that's okay.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Boy for the left me. I'm not really sure I'm not the tech, savvy?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Okay.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Yeah, that's okay. I think throughout our conversation saying, I don't know is a perfectly good answer for me, because it's helpful to remember or to know that it's not always easy to remember all the different options right?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Yeah.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And so usually, when you go and sign in, you mentioned that you use the mobile app. Is that usually how you sign in? Or do you use your computer?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Yeah. Oh, yeah. My phone, you know, I use it on the phone and that's really helpful. I have the app.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
It just says, Va, that's the Va.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And then I tap that, and then they asked me to.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So the password and stuff my username, hey, boy, come on, I just I try to.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:02.000
That was the other thing. When I tried to use the Ds sign in or whatever it's called, I couldn't figure out what my username was, what username I used.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Okay.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And so that's that's difficult. I may is fine.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Yeah, okay, right? So you know, you probably have Ds setup.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But you're not exactly sure what your username is.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
But so that's why you've been using. Yeah, okay, gotcha.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And how long ago?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Yes, yes, yes, oh wait no! Here's what happened.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:33.000
They told me, my username, all our case, Michael J. Contest. Okay, that's why he's running then I tried to get the the password, and we couldn't figure it out.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Then they asked me at first 3 questions. What was the name of your first boyfriend?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Or girlfriend, and what street did your best friend live on when you were growing up?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I thought I knew all the answers. While I plugged them in.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
They were rejected. So that was the other thing. Yeah.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Okay, okay. So you had trouble kind of recovering your account.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Yes, yes. So I gave up. Yeah.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Okay? And is that around the time when you set up Id, dot me?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Oh, okay, this morning you set up id dot me.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
No, it's just morning this morning when yeah, I got the.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Were you the one that contacted me? Someone called.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Yeah, maybe that was Shannon. Yeah.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Oh, okay. And I think, well, you know, let me try it.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Let me see if I can do it, and found out that I could not.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Well, what are you gonna do?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Gotcha. Okay, okay? So you've been using id dot, me, it sounds like for a little while now, and you're actually not able to get into your Ds logon account right now.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
That's correct.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Okay, that's really helpful. Well, we're probably gonna get a little further confused through our conversation today as we talk more about these sign-in methods.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Okay. Sure.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So you'll just have to bear with me. But it's really helpful to understand what we're what you're using and what your perspective is.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Right now, I think what we'll do next is we're gonna start to look at that prototype that I mentioned.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Okay, so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna send you a link in the chat on Zoom so I'll send that right now.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Do you see that coming up on your side?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Yeah, so, Umhm, there's a couple of different options down at the bottom.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I sit, you mean down at the bottom? I'm yeah.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
It should say chat. Maybe.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Chat. Okay, I'll hit that. Okay. Oh!

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Yeah, perfect. And then in the chat, do you see a link there?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It's a long link.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Yeah, it's a long one. Yeah, I'll click that.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Perfect, so we'll let that open up, and then you might not be able to see me.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But you can hear me still right.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It's blurry. Okay, yeah, I can see it now.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Okay.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Okay.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Healthcare disability. Education. Yeah. Okay? Oh, yeah. I've seen this before.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Looks. I think I have.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Okay, perfect. So we're gonna keep that website up. And then I, what I want you to try and do is we're gonna share your screen.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Is that something you've done before?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Yeah, sure, yeah.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Okay, perfect. So if you come back to the zoom window and then you share your screen, let me know if you're having.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Zoom window, am I in the zoom window?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Nope!

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
No!

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Can you see my face? Okay? So you're probably not in the zoom window yet.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So you're are you looking at that Va website that you opened up?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Yeah.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Okay, so somewhere else, you're gonna have zoom open up on your computer.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So you might be able to find.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I have host attendee, zoom! I have that, and then.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Okay, okay, that's an old one, maybe. Hmm.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And then I have veterans, user experience. Now, that's my email.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
No, I can't figure out how to see your picture.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Okay, what about if I if I asked you to kind of minimize the website that you're on, does that mean anything to you?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Oh, yeah, now, I could see you. Yeah, yeah, how about you?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
You can see me now. Oh, perfect. Okay, yes, I can see you.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Can you see me? Okay?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So on the zoom window. If we're looking at our faces just at the bottom of our faces, there's a couple of different icons.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Yeah.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
There's one in the middle that's green. It says, share screen.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
You see that one?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Share screen. Okay. Yup, I got it.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Okay.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Okay, perfect. So we'll click on that. And it's gonna have a couple of different options show up so you're just gonna look for that one that looks like it has the Va website.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And if you can't find that you can click on desktop, and that'll work too.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Okay, let's click on screen.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I see screen, whiteboard, iphone, ipad, look, screen.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I think screen, and then we'll click, share.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Oh, yeah, okay, screen. Well, I click. Oh, there you go!

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Okay.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Yeah, that's perfect. Okay, so so now, what's happening is, I can see your screen.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So I'm looking at what you're looking at.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Oh, okay, yeah, that's you're wondering.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Yeah.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Okay, so it looks beautiful. Let's try and open up that website that we were on a little bit earlier.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Let me see!

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Do we know where that ended up? We might. What we might need to do is click on zoom at the very bottom of your computer.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
You've got that blue icon. Yeah.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Okay, bottom on my computer right screen, sharing zoom cloud meeting.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Yeah, let's click on.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
No, that's the sign in.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
This is.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Do you know what? Maybe you see, that chrome? Do you know, does that mean anything to you?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
If I say chrome that chrome icon, it's that.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Yeah, that's perfect. Let's click on that. There we go. Okay.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Oh, okay, yeah, there you go.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Awesome, so you can still hear my voice. I don't think you can see me, but hopefully you can.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I'm gonna try my glasses, too. Okay, go ahead alright.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Yeah, perfect. Alright. So now I'm looking at the Va website.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Then.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And you're looking at the Va website. Okay?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Yeah.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Alrighty. So you said this looked familiar to you. Is this something that you would use when you're going online to do stuff like message?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Your doctor?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I think I have, or something similar to this. Excuse me for the records download medical records.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Request. Yeah. The Dd, 2, 14. And that's basically it.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
The other stuff I already have, I mean, are already got.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
My disability cost my healthcare is on track, I mean, so.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
But yeah, the records is the ones I've used recently yeah, I don't know.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Okay.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
A couple of months ago. Get your Va. Medical records.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I was having a I'm having acupuncture done at the Va. Hospital.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I'm also getting massage done, all paid for by the Va.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Okay.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Uhhuh. I think so.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And I had some X-rays done on my upper upper back and neck, and then my lower back, and what I want us to do is have them available for the acupuncturist and for the masseuse is that a guy who yeah, and so that's

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:18.000
this is where I went to, or something similar to this, to request it, and they mailed me out.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Hey? A film type thing, or whatever like it, like in an X-ray form. And yeah, so I've used this before. Yes.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Gotcha. Okay? Okay, that's really helpful.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So it sounds like you're familiar with, especially with the records.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Yeah.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Part of the Va website. Let's let's go ahead and scroll up a little bit on this website.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:43.000
So if we can see the top of the screen. Yeah, that's perfect.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Yeah.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Alrighty! So for today, what we're gonna do is we're gonna imagine that you come online because you wanted to access your records.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Okay.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Okay. And so the first thing that you decide to do is sign in.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Alright!

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So we're gonna click, yeah, perfect. So it looks like you found the sign in quite quickly.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And then we're gonna stay on this page for a second.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Is this looking familiar to you?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is the one I tried to go on today.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Yeah.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I use the Id. Me all the time. But then, you see below it says, Ds log on. That's where I had my problems.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Right? Okay. So you've had issues with Ds log on.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But you at least can get into all the Va. Stuff with Id.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Dot me right now.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Oh, yeah, my id, me, and probably probably I haven't tried the other 2.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Okay.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
My health. That probably looks something like something I could do. I don't know.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Okay. Gotcha. Well for today, I'm gonna throw a little bit of a curveball at you.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Okay.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
We are. Gonna imagine that you're signing in with Ds log on right now.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Okay, I know Dslagon's not working well for you, so we'll have to use a little bit of an imagination.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
But we're going to click on Ds log on.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
How are you doing?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Okay. Yes. Please.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Okay.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Perfect, so we're not gonna enter any information in today.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Oh!

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Oh, that's perfect. We're gonna sit on this page now.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So before we click anything, I'm gonna give you a second to read this screen. Okay?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Okay, so.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Okay, I read, I read, yeah, I saw something like, I tried this today. Okay.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Okay, yeah, tell me more about that. So this looks familiar to you.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Yeah, I had where they said they wanted to verify my identity.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I, and they asked me whole bunch of things to include my social security number.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And so I know I provided the information at least twice, and it's still we can go through.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Yeah, right?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Okay, right? And so was that when you were trying to get access to your Ds logon account, okay? Alright.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
So this looks kind of familiar. And what what is this telling you?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000
On this screen that we're looking at right now. What's the message? It's trying to get across?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:39.000
To create the sign in to get into the account, to take advantage of what's available on the website.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Okay. So they want you to be able to get into your account.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So you can go onto the website and do whatever you need to do.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Okay.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Yeah, sure be your point, me, or ordering medication, checking with your main provider whatever.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Yeah, that makes sense. And what are these different buttons?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
So what are the options it's giving you? Can you describe those to me?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Well, the 2 at the bottom. Is, you can create a new one if you don't have an account, and then continue with your Ds.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Okay.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Login for now, and I tried both. I think, yeah, I tried both.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And I like. They told me that though the email address that I gave already is being used. So that's what I knew that I must have signed up before.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Okay, Gotcha. And when you say they told you who was telling you this?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Oh, I'm you know, the computer computer messages? Yeah.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Okay, yeah, okay, that makes sense. And if we were gonna click, create login, dot.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Gov. Account. What would you expect to happen next?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Go to another link, and they'll ask me my name, my address, my phone number, my my years of service.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Maybe you know my rank, what branch of service, and possibly where I get any past treatments like to be a hospital of Philadelphia.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Okay, yeah. So some information about you as a veteran and some of your, maybe your medical history.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Yes, yes.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Okay. And so we're just gonna look at this a little more closely now.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
So the first line it says, Dslog on, we'll stop working for Va.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Digital tools soon. What does that mean?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Good question. I have no idea what a BA digital tool is.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Be honest with you, I mean I would be thinking it's a mouse that I'm moving around and being able to touch a link and press the button.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
I don't know.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Okay, okay, that's a fair answer. So it's not clear what va, digital tools is.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Yeah.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
What about the part that says Ds. Logon will stop working soon.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:27.000
What does that mean?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
You know. Be honest, I don't know. I really don't know.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Okay.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
You know. Yeah, I don't know.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:44.000
That's okay. And what if this? Said Id. Dot, me will stop working for va digital tools soon.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
What would you? How would you react to something if it said that id dot?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Me. Will stop working soon.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:59.000
I wouldn't want to contact someone in authority and say what the hell is going on here.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:09.000
I mean, why are you ending it? Well? Why are you causing such a anxiety to us for veterans?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Okay. So you'd be frustrated.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Yes, yes, very much so.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Maybe a little bit concerned. Umhm, okay? And you said you'd wanna contact someone so if you were looking at this screen and it said something like, Id Dot, me will stop working soon.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
How would you go and contact somebody, or figure out who to contact?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:36.000
But I would call the orange team for doctors, which includes Dr.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Okay.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Okay.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Fetzer, my main provider, and there they've been pretty good about responding to questions I had, and problems, and then they would get back to me of the phone.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:56.000
I imagine that they were trying to get in touch with someone who knows more than just medical stuff, cause you know, this is technical.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Is that it? Yeah, okay, it stuff. Yeah, yeah.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Yes.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Yeah, yeah, it sounds like, it's it. Yeah, okay, okay, so your first idea would be to call your medical team actually, who you have.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Probably a closer relationship with. And you'd hope maybe they could get more information.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Yes, exactly. Exactly.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Yeah, okay, that makes sense and and I do, wanna reassure you, it's not saying that id dot.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
No!

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Me. Will stop working soon, so I'll use some hypotheticals.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Sure!

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Throughout our conversation. Okay, so what about at the at the bottom?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:37.000
It says, note, this account will only work for Va digital tools in the future.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
You may need to to verify your identity again, to use login.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Gov. On other government webinars.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
So? Do you want me to repeat that one more time?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Yeah.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Is that helpful?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
So yeah, me, I'm trying to figure out what they're saying.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Yeah.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Okay. Oh, yeah. Well, no. What it? What? I guess it looks like in the future.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
They're gonna have to get my social security number again.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
My address, and all that pertinent information, and I have no problem with that.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
You know? Yeah.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Yeah, okay, so verifying your identity means that they're gonna need your social security number.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
And maybe your address. So a little bit of information about you.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Okay, and what?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Yes, right. I just hope they don't ask me who was the name of your girlfriend when you were a kid, cause you know I gave him the name, but they didn't like it.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Yeah, that's that's a tough question.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
I don't know. Oh, well, yeah.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:42.000
So okay. So it'll ask you for some information.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:48.000
And then why is it saying that this account is only going to work for the Va.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000
Until you give them that information. Do you know what that's about?

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
I think it's limited to the Va.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Only no other, no other government agency, or a private agency.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Okay. So you could only use this account for the Va.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Yes, right?

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:13.000
And not any other agency. Okay, okay? And is there any way for you to use this for another government agency?

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
For example.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:32.000
No, I mean and again, I don't know why I mean I can't think of any other government agency that, or whatever trying to use it for.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Yes, that's it, you know.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Okay. So even if it was just for the Va, you would, that would be okay if you were able to set up the account because you really just need it for the Va, yeah, okay, that's helpful.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000
So what we're gonna do next is this has been really helpful, and I appreciate you answering all my small questions.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Next, we're gonna click on create login.gov account.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Okay, so we're gonna find that link. Yeah, that's perfect.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Okay.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Yeah.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Alright! So before we move on again, I'm not gonna make you enter any information today.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000
This is just kind of like a pretend picture of the website.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Sure, yeah, right?

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
So what are we looking at right now?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
This is creating an account for the first time users.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I would think. And as the email address, they want you to create a password and then sign in at the very bottom, says, create an account.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Oh, so you have 2 options. One is, if you are already a member, you can sign in, and if you're not, you can create an account.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Gotcha. Okay, that's perfect. So if we're creating an account today, let's go ahead and continue, and I'll let you click what you would choose if you were going to create an account.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
You want me to fill in the details or not?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
No, you don't need to fill them in.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Yeah, we'll just pretend like you fill them in, and then you can go ahead.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Okay, so I wanna create an account. I'll get it.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Yeah, that's perfect.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Okay. Hi, then I enter my email address. I would ask for English as my default and then continue.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Yeah, that's perfect.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Then go and check my email and type, whatever whatever link that they're asking me to check.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Martha Martha at Gmail. Okay.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Okay.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Definitely not me. Follow the and continue, okay. And I check email.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Okay, let's confirm your email. Okay, thanks for submitting your email address.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Please click the link. Let's say I've done that confirm email address.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Okay. So we'll stay on this page now for just a moment.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
So that's that's pretty straightforward so far, you've put in your email address.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Yeah, right?

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Right.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Then you got sent an email and you clicked on a link, and then you continued, if you were doing something like this, you were setting up an account on your computer, would where would you check your email, how would you check that?

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Would you open up your phone? Would you? Yeah?

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Oh, no! I am so. I have this little boxes at the very top of my my laptop computer.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Okay.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Right? Okay.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
So just go back to the first one, and then, you know, travel along.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Gotcha! That's helpful. Alrighty!

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Yeah.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
We can continue so same thing you were doing before. Just let me know what you'd be doing next on this page.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000
I would create a password when I use all over the place.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
I'm sorry. I just need to say password.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Okay.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
I shouldn't. But yeah, so at least 12. Character.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Yeah. So I put that in, can I hit? Continue?

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Yes, you can.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Now, here's the authentication. Okay, face or touch, lock.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:51.000
But no, I I don't. They have a face I I didn't know that.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
It looks like it. Yeah, okay.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Wow! Wow! I didn't know that. I mean, I've got the phone one from my cell phone.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Yeah.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:11.000
But security, key I I don't like using them I'm not a government employee, I don't like the authentication application.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
I got that on my cell phone. I never use it.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Okay.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Text or voice message, yeah, I do that all the time. Yeah. So that's what I would do.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Okay, okay. So that was, yeah, that was really helpful. So you went down the list and you kind of felt like text or voice message was the best option for you.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Yes, yes, exactly. Hit continue.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Okay, yeah, I think it might actually need to click text or voice message first.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
So if you click, yeah, let's try clicking that.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Click, okay, I'll click that. Okay. Got it alright.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Yeah. Continue. Yup. Alright.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Yeah, perfect, and then we'll go down and click, continue perfect alright, and then let me know what you're seeing here.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Send your security code via text. I'm not sure I know what a security code is.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:08.000
And phone number, yeah, the phone number. I would type in my phone number.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Okay.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Oh, then they'd send me the text message, and then I would have to remember that 6 digit number, and I'm thinking, man, I'm so thankful my memory is not shot because I can remember it from maybe 30 s, maybe 20 s and transfer.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
You know. But yeah, okay. Now I know what it is. Okay.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Gotcha alright. So you put your phone number in.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Yes.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Yeah.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
You would choose text, message, and then you get sent that probably 6 digit code, and you'd have to remember it for enough amount of time that you can enter it in.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Yes.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Alright!

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Okay, that's makes sense. So let's click. Send code we'll pretend like you got sent this this code and you typed it in.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Okay. Perfect. Alright!

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Okay. I'll submit it. You got it. You first.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
So we'll stay on this page for a moment, and you go ahead and read this. Yeah.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Oh, thank you. A second. Yeah, it says, the second method. I have a backup, I guess it would have to be my email.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Okay, that's what you would choose. Yeah.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Send. Send it to my email. I'd rather not get a phone call.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Right? Okay.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
So you know, send it to my email.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Okay, so that's what you would hope to choose for your other method.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Yeah, click.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
So for today, we're gonna yeah. We're gonna oh, we're gonna actually skip creating, adding another method.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000
So we'll continue on as if we skipped that.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Okay. So now we're on. Now we're on the screen.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Okay.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
What does this screen telling us?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Your account, set up this complete, alright, and do you want me to agree and continue?

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
I'll click that. Oh, sorry!

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Before we do that, you're too quick for me.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Sorry.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
That's okay. Let's go back. If you're able to click back, you can even do it on the keyboard.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
If you click the back button. Oh, that's perfect!

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Okay. Alright!

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000
There you go alright. So on this screen, it said, your account setup is complete.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Yeah, right?

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000
It felt like that, was pretty straightforward for you. It does say something on there that I wanted to ask you about, so it says we'll share this information with the Va.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Why do you think they're sharing the information with the Va.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Oh, okay. Oh, okay. You know, I was under the mistake in idea that this was the Va.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Yeah.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:29.000
That I was working on. And it's not. It is, I guess, a group that is working either for or in.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Yeah.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
I hate your word in connection with the Via.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Is that correct?

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Gotcha, you know, I'm gonna be annoying person right now.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Oh, Robert! Alright! Alright! Wait! Wait! Wait till I get you.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
I'm not gonna answer your question just yet, but I'll answer all the questions at the end.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000
When I get you on the witness stand, I'm gonna cross.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Yeah, I'll definitely make sure there's time at the end.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Examine.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
I mean you can do that. Alright!

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Alright! Alright!

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
So reading that you actually kind of realized, oh, maybe I haven't been on the Va.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Website this whole time. I didn't realize that. Yeah, that's helpful.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Alright. Well, let's go ahead and click, accept, agree, and get.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Okay.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Okay? And then before we click anything on this screen, I just wanna give you a second to read what you're seeing here.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Okay.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Okay. What? I don't know is other government websites.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Again. I you know I I really don't know what would be.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Okay.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
That would be for well, let's say I need to contact the Attorney General Pennsylvania or the Department of Defense.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Federally, I guess I could use that information, so I had.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Okay.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:04.000
I've been hacked several times, and so I I've been in touch with the Attorney General's office, and Dod to no avail.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000
It couldn't get the money back. But in any case, yeah, but maybe that's what it's for.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Okay, so you have some idea of what the government websites might be.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
But it's not super clear. It feels like what else wise?

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Yes, it's not. But yeah.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Yeah, okay, why is it telling you that you've signed in with login?

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Dot gov.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Because there are at least 3 other ways to sign in, and I' imagine each one is independent of the other.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Okay. Gotcha.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
And so they're trying to show that you're in login.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
You're not an Id or Ds sort of the others were.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Yeah, that makes sense. And before we got to this screen we went through all those other ones where you were putting in your email, and you were verifying your email.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000
And you chose to get a text message code and did all of that.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:06.000
What was that about? What were we doing before we got to this page?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Oh, we're providing the pertinent information for me to use the tools.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:16.000
Okay, okay, so we're providing the information for you to use the tools.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:24.000
And what and what did you receive at the end of providing all that information?

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Assurance that it would be shared with the Va.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Website, and then I could sign in and take care of business.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And then we see this link here that says, Learn more about verifying your identity with login.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Gov. What would you expect to see if you clicked on that link?

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:04.000
If I need to make any changes or improvements.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000
And just to see what I've already done.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Okay, yeah. Gotcha. So it would tell you a little bit about what you've done, and then what you might need to change or improve.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Yes, yes.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Okay, Gotcha, and you know why, when we first started this process, we talked about how you were coming on to the Va website so that you could access your records if you wanted to access your records.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Now, do you know what you would do?

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
What do you mean now?

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
On this screen, just in this hypothetical? Yeah.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.000
What on this screen?

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
On the screen. You know you do. Next to access your records.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
I would. Well!

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
I mean, you're talking about the whole thing I have up to around here.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Yeah, I'm just wondering, I guess, where you would click next.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
So what would be the next step you take?

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Okay. Let's see my Va, my Va.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Okay.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Or my health. I'll go to one of those and try to try to see you know what I can that way.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Yeah.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Yeah, okay, and when we see this white box popping up, kind of in the middle of the screen, if you wanted to, if you wanted to get out of that box, how would you do that?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Hit close.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Okay, perfect. Let's do that. Next, let's click close.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Alright out of there, claims and appeals, you know.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Alrighty!

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000
I, yeah, I got a 100% disability for having people.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000
And then a 10% hearing loss from explosions.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:57.000
So 10%. And then a 100%. And so there's no nothing for me to claim or repeat. Healthcare is yeah.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Yeah, okay.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
I would definitely when you use healthcare, send the secure.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Yeah, I've done that matter of fact, I sent a message today to Dr.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Hmm!

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Okay.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Fetzer. He told me yesterday or 2 days ago I didn't read the message until today that they're not going to, recommended chiropractor for my back because of my aorta, and they don't want to apply pressure down below so anyway, i've used this message

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Okay.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
today, just a few hours ago. And you know I'm always I'm always getting notices about my appointments.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Yeah.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
So, if yeah, and I have it for an hour. So that's even better.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:36:00.000
And again, yeah, so yeah, I would use this information to help help me.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Yeah.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Yeah, that's that makes sense. Okay, so this is looking like certain tasks that that you actually have a lot of familiarity with, especially with your healthcare tasks.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Yeah.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Right, when when you're doing a lot of these healthcare tasks like your messaging with your doctor today, are you on the my healthy?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
That website.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000
I used a Va link. I'm not sure you know.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Yeah, that's okay.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Yeah, I know. Let's see if I can get this.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Let's see. Can you see you see where it says? I don't know if you can see it.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
I can't really see it.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.000
But you're. I think you're showing me the Va app right?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Alright! It says, Va, yeah, okay. I just clicked it.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Yeah, okay.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:48.000
And now it says, the touch. Id for va us department of veterans affairs signing me in and.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.000
You can't read any of the Kenya.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
No, I'm.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:57.000
No Hi, good afternoon, Michael. Joseph. Claims and appeals.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Health care, letters, payments, and so I already had. That's what I do right.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Gotcha!

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Yeah.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000
I go on my website here, my cell phone and I've I've got all the information right here.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Yeah.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So you find the app works pretty well for you, especially with id dominant.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Yeah, that's really helpful. So you've answered a lot of my questions already.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
There's a couple more things I wanted to ask you about.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
So one we're going to do next is just click at the top of the screen in that dark part of the screen.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Just click anywhere up there. Yeah, that works.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Right? Here, okay.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
And see if that lets us go.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000
It says, the transcript from this meeting may be saved and shared with apps and others by participants, with relevant permissions based on the settings.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Yeah, that's fine. No problem.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Awesome. So I think that might have been from the zoom window.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
So if we're are you back, we're back on this Va website.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Yeah, right?

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Now, right? I just wanna make sure. Yeah, okay, perfect. So let's click at the top kind of just above where your pointer is right now, just below that.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Right below that.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Why don't we click where it says, Va, you see where it says, Va, yeah, that's perfect.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Right there.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Okay.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
There we go! Alrighty. So we've just went through a number of different steps to set up an account right.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Okay.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
We were on the Va. Website at just now. We're gonna imagine that we've signed out. Okay.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Alright!

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Okay.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000
So we finished doing whatever we were gonna do, and we signed out and a couple of weeks go by.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
So now it's May and we're ready to sign into it to the Va.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Because we need to do something else right? So what will we do?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Okay.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
What will we do next? To sign in?

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
I would hit the sign in Button.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Perfect. Let's go ahead and do that.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Alright, and then, knowing what you know me, I go id me.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Okay.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Are you my health that I think I've used that before. But how should I try that?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Well, for now let's just stay on this page for a second.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
Sure!

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Yes.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:12.000
So id dot me, we know, is familiar. My healthy bet you might adjve tried before, and then just now we set up a new account right in this pretend scenario.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Yeah.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
What type of account did we set up?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Login.com.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Okay. And why do you think we set up that account?

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
It's the first one.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Yeah, okay.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
The more the preferable one. I would think.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Yeah. Why do you think it's preferable? What made you think that?

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:42.000
I think it has closer time to the Government, and they've got it in the name Gov.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000
I don't know.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Not sure.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Okay, so not really sure. But you know it's the first option, and that it probably, or might be, connected to the government.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Yes.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:40:02.000
That's helpful. Okay? So if we were gonna sign in again today, it seemed like you were probably gonna choose id dot.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Me, is that right? Okay? And so right now, you've got id dot.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Me, and you also have login.gov. In this scenario.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
When you say, yeah, right? Right?

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Okay. And so why would you choose logging.gov instead of id dot me?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
And there might not be a good reason.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Well, we went through the whole process, and I figured, well, let me give you a shot, I mean, see if it works for me, and and if it didn't work I go right back to Id.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Gotcha. Okay? So it's almost like you'll give it a try if it doesn't work otherwise.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
I've got another option, and I'll keep using that. Okay.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Yes, exactly. Exactly.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Yeah. And if it didn't work this time, do you think from then on you'd use Id got me.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Yeah, yeah, that's helpful. Let's go ahead and click on login.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Gov. Which might feel a little bit confusing. But we're gonna try it out.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000
And then we're gonna pretend like we're signing in. Okay?

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000
So we don't need to enter any information but what would you click next?

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Sign, in.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Okay, perfect. Let's click on that.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Alright. So I'm gonna give you a second to read this screen. Now.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Oh, I never noticed it. You could use it for security and federal job applicable social security. Yeah, okay.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:05.000
State issued Id. I mentioned that would be my driver's license.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Maybe.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Yeah, I mean, down below, you can see what we will need to verify your identity.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Yeah. Okay. Alright. Good. Yeah. I'm finished.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Alright. Okay, that's helpful. So it sounded like you had a bit of a maybe a good reaction to seeing social security benefits.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Yeah, I, mean, yeah, I've had to get try to get in touch with social security.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:34.000
I had to ask them to deduct more money out of my monthly payment, so I don't have to pay as much income tax, you know.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Okay.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.000
April fifteenth.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Okay. Gotcha. And so what made it positive?

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Was it just that you recognize social security as something that you also use?

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Is there anything else that? Okay?

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Gotcha. Okay? And so right now, you know, in this scenario we've set up a login Gov account.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Could you use your login.gov account tab account? Could you use your login.gov account to access social security?

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
That's what it says. Here, yeah, yeah.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Gotcha? Okay? Yeah, that's helpful. And let's look at that first sentence.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.000
So it says you are using a Va. Only login.gov account.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Okay.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:33.000
What does that mean?

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Yeah.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Well, you know, after reading about so security, I am not really sure I know what it means, because reading about social security use this doesn't make any sense that it's only for Va.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Only I mean you're say you are using Va, only login government account.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
I really don't know. I don't know.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Yeah, that's okay. So it kind of feels like the first sentence is, maybe contradicting what it's saying about social security. Gotcha.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Yes, the thing about subsecurity. Yeah.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Okay. That's really helpful. And then you notice that it says what you will need to verify your identity.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Yeah.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Right.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
It says you need a state issued Id. A social security number, and your phone number.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Yes.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000
So if I told you that right now we were gonna verify your identity, what would you expect to happen next?

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000
You would want to. My sister's security number.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:40.000
My my address. I guess my driver's license number, which I don't.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:46.000
My son has memorized his. I don't know you know. I'm lucky enough to know my social security number.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Yeah.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
You know. But yeah, but yeah, that's it, you know.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:56.000
And then my phone number.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Yes.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Okay, alright. So you would expect to enter some more information if you were, gonna verify your identity.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Exactly. Yes.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Okay. And why would you verify your identity?

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:10.000
There's been a request by someone in authority.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Okay, Gotcha. So that so someone in authority is that somebody from the Va.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Well, here would be someone working for the Va login.gov people.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Okay. So login.gov is working for the Va. And they want you to verify your identity.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Right working for the Va. Or in coordination with the Va. Yes, yes.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Gotcha gotcha. Okay? And so it feels like, does it feel like there's an option?

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Or it feels like you have to verify your identity.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:56.000
If they don't recognize the first sign in, then they have to verify.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Gotcha. Okay? So this is kind of like, something almost went wrong the first time.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
And so now we need you to verify your identity.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Yes, yes, exactly right. Right.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Yeah, okay, that's really helpful. And when it says, No, thanks, I don't want to verify what?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Why do you think it's giving you that option?

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:20.000
You know that I don't know. That's I. I really don't know.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000
It's like someone is afraid to give up.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Lot of people are reluctant to give their social security.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Yeah.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Numbers of the phone. And so maybe that's one of the reasons why they don't wanna do that.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Gotcha. Okay? So they're trying to give somebody who might not feel comfortable sharing this information away out.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Yes, yes, exactly right. Right.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Okay. Alrighty. So let's say that you weren't comfortable sharing your social security number.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.000
Yeah.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
And so you are, gonna choose? No, thanks. I don't want to verify. What do you think?

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Should I do that?

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Would happen. Let's not click on it yet. But what do you think?

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Okay.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Would happen if we clicked on that.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Well, then, they would try to find out other ways.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:14.000
To determine if it's really me that is trying to get on this website.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Gotcha!

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Otherwise I'm not really sure.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Okay. Otherwise, we're not sure what would happen. Okay?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Yeah, I'm not sure.

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:36.000
So it feels like it's pretty important for you to at least either verify your identity or be able to do some sort of backup way of verifying your identity in order to keep doing things with the Va online.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Yes, yes.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Okay. Okay. Gotcha. And when you set up your id dot me account I I can't remember how long ago you set up your id dot me account.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:53.000
But do you remember that process of setting up the account?

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Yeah.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:48:06.000
I didn't think it was that bad. I mean to be honest with you, and of course, definitely easier than what I tried to do today with the Ds.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Yeah.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000
And I was quite proud of myself being able to get it and get it done without much trouble.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Yeah.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Yeah, that's great. Yeah. So it was a good feeling when you set it up. And it also wasn't as maybe as hard as you expected or definitely not as hard as what it was trying to okay.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Yes, yes, and I think I might be wrong, but I think I might be able to use Id a different sites.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
That dealing with government functions, etc.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Gotcha. Okay. And so what does that mean? You can use Id dot me at different sites.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Can you tell me more about that?

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Yeah, well, like I said, maybe Pennsylvania Governor, Government, Dmv.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Motor vehicles, the court system, anything involving the Federal Government.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Something might be Mike and Council, my Congresswoman by State or my State, and my Federal Senator, who knows?

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Yeah.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Okay, gotcha. So let's pretend like you were.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Gonna use your your id dot me and you you can go ahead.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.000
And actually, why don't we try and close this screen so you can come back to zoom?

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:28.000
So somewhere on your screen, I think, towards the top it does it look like it?

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Says stop Sharing.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Alright at the top. Let's say it says, let's see.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Stop sharing. Oh, yeah, okay, I just oh, okay, yeah.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
It might be like a red bar. There you go, perfect! Alright!

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
So now we can just have a chat to finish up.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Oh, okay.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000
So we're talking about Id, dot me, and how you might be able to use it, for you listed quite a few examples which was helpful.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Let's let's say that you were going to try and use your Id.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Dot me account with the Dmb. How would that work?

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Where would you start?

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Yeah.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Well, I would. Google. Dmv pen, Pennsylvania, and then go to their website.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:20.000
And when they start asking for information, I would, and if it, if I would give my Id.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Id.id dot me, or whatever it's called id me.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Yeah, yeah, okay, perfect. That sounds kind of straightforward.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000
We've answered a whole lot of my questions today.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:38.000
If you are going to go, tell your grandk what you just did, or your grandkids.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
I think you said there was multiple downstairs. Yeah.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Yes, with the 3 year old, 5 year old, and then my son's wife had 2 previous kids that were 10 and 12.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Okay.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:55.000
So is that? Why get a houseful? We got some chats, too, if you need a cat.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:56.000
How about a rooster or 2? We got riches in the background.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Oh, awesome! Well, let's let's say you were gonna go to chat to your rooster after we finished, and you were, gonna tell them what we did today.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.000
How would you describe what we've just done?

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:18.000
We went over, how easy or how difficult a website for the Va.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Maneuverability was. This is geared towards veterans.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Who are using Va facilities. In my case it would.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:35.000
It's the hospital, and they want to ensure.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Things are better and still working well, so that future veterans will have a little bit easier.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Yeah.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly right. And it's been really helpful to have this conversation for those exact reasons.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:52:03.000
And what?

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000
I think it's gonna be up to you, and we can talk.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Oh, okay. Now, am I gonna get some marijuana or Lsd added this deal, or I mean, come on, man, yeah, I wish.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:13.000
We can talk a little bit about that. Actually, the person who contacted you earlier who set up this interview.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:16.000
I think that their name's Shannon.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Yes. Shannon. Yeah. Right?

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:24.000
They're going to be the one who? Yeah, yeah. So Shannon's gonna be the one that manages payment.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Yeah.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
So if you have any questions about payment, I don't know if she could answer any questions about marijuana or Lsd.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000
No. No. Oh, okay.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:42.000
But but you can let her know, and Shannon's also gonna let you know she's gonna give you like a little bit of a blurb that you can share with other veterans in case anybody else wanted to do something like what we've done today.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Okay.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
But I think that's you've answered all my questions.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:52.000
I do want to give you a couple minutes in case you had any questions for me.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:58.000
No! But again I I've had so much, so many good things.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:04.000
I had my colon cancer removed 7 years ago at the Va. Hospital.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Yeah.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:26.000
My cataract removed or fixed, whatever you want to call it, and I'm getting all my free medications, which is good, and I just learned I can get the I've had 2 treatments already, I'm going back tomorrow morning at 90'clock, for a third treatment and

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000
and about 2, 3 weeks I'm massage. But this ain't like the regular massages.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:38.000
This is by Guy, who knows about the pain in my lower back and knows how to move that leg.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
So I just wanna say, get treatments at the Va.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Because it really works. And it's helpful.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.000
That's great. That's really great to hear. I'm glad you've had that experience.

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Yeah.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000
And yeah, that's awesome. Well, I hope you.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.000
