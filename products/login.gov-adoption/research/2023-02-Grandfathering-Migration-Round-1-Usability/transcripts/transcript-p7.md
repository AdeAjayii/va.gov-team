00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay, I started recording. I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If I record my screen and audio as we talk today.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Yes.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Great. I'd like to start by learning a little bit more about your experience with the Va.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And some of our online services. How long have you been a veteran?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Oh, you just beated yourself! I can't hear you.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I was medically retired in December of 2015.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Okay. Can you repeat that again?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Yup. I was medically retired, and December 2015.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Okay, Gotcha. And how often do you go online to access and manage your Va benefits and healthcare?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Definitely okay. A couple of times a week for sure.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Okay, yeah, pretty frequently. Do you remember the last time that you signed into the Va.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
To Va online.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Last night.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Oh, wow! Great! And why were you signing in last night?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I have a appeal going, and I just was checking status to see if anything had been updated. And I update.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Gotcha!

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I also oh, no, I did that. Friday, Friday I renewed my prescriptions online as well.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Oh, fantastic! Do you remember how you sign into the Va.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Yes, I use the. I have the Va app on my phone, and so I use the Va app, and I think it uses Login Gov as my login procedure.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Okay, great. And why do you use Login Daca to sign in?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I know I used to use like Ds log on, or something like that, was what it was called. But once.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Once it updated it said there was a more streamlined process, and I had done it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Survey kind of like this with the Va. From and they said it was an easier login, and they walked me through it when I was doing that survey thing, and it was way easier.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So I just been using that one.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Oh, great, great! So you used to use Dslog on, but being able to being introduced to login, you found that it was, you discover that it was easier.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So you now use that one.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Yeah, and I, I think now I can use with the S or with the login.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Gov, I can use my fingerprint, so I fingerprint login on the Va.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
With!

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Okay, that's great.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Is there anything else you want to share with me about signing in before we move on?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I don't think so.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Okay, so next, I'd like to share some ideas with you, so we can get your feedback in a minute.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm gonna send you a link to a prototype.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I mentioned earlier that a prototype is like a pretend version of an email or a website.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:15.000
So it's going to look similar. But it won't work as you might expect, because it's not a real email or a website. Are you dialing in from a phone?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I am. Yes!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Okay, actually, I'm gonna need you to call in on your computer.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Oh, you're just muted!

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Let me go into my office now. We'll do that real quick.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Okay, thank you so much.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Are you Chris Martinez?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Yeah, I don't know why it says that, but yes.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
That's okay, I assume. Okay, so I'm gonna meet you here.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Okay. Great.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Perfect. Okay? So I'm gonna share that prototype with you in the chat.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I'm gonna say.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
There we go!

00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:01.000
If you can open up that link on your computer. And are you familiar with sharing your screen in Zoom?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Oh, I'm getting you to unmute yourself on, either on your phone or on your laptop.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I think I am. I see here real quick.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Okay. I can walk you through it, if not.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Okay, maybe I do need help. So.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Okay, sure. So if you come back to. So you've opened up that link in a browser.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Yes.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Oh, yeah, got it?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Great. So if you come back to the zoom application on your laptop. Down at the bottom of the screen of the zoom window there should be a green button that says, share screen great.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Perfect, and I can see what you're looking at. If you want to make that a little bit bigger, then I can I can get a better look.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So!

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Make that perfect wonderful. Okay, so now that you have this open, I'd like to I'd like you to start by imagining that you've just received and I'm gonna give you a second to read this more closely now.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And when you're finished I'd like you to summarize what you've read.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Okay.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Okay, so it just looks like, it's telling me that the Ds log on will soon stop working.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So it's want me to create the Login Dot.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Gov, okay.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Okay? And do you have any initial questions? After reading this email?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
I don't think so. It's pretty straightforward.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And what is the email asking you to do?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
There's a blue link that says, Go to va.gov. To create an account.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Okay. And in this scenario you've just received this this email.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And would you be interested in sending up a login account right now?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Yeah, because I'd want to continue being able to get my Va, I just want to continue to be able to view my account.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Do you have any hesitations about setting up a login account?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Right.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000
No, I mean like, I said. I already have one, but I I didn't see when I initially, when I got the email from the Web sort of thing that I did. It was pretty straight.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I mean, it was kind of straightforward like pretty straightforward like this, and it was just, you know, saying, Hey, it's still secure.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000
This is a login, that government we're just going away.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And so I get, you know, things change and times change things.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So I don't think it would be any issue at all.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Great. Why do you think the Va. Is recommending that you set up a long and Gov. Account?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:40.000
That I don't know I'm guessing that stuff, just, you know, gets out of date, and you just it's time for upgrades and migrations and stuff like that.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
So that's.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
If you had a question about that email, what would you do?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Honestly, I probably reach out to other retrofit, gotten the same thing, or had any questions.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Otherwise I'd probably I'd go to the bottom, and I know usually the bottom of the page.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
You can say contact us, or whatever, and kind of get some questions answered.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So that's probably what go to.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Gotcha. Okay? Well, yeah. So we've already clicked ahead on that button.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And is this page what you expected to see after after seeing that email? This is where you thought you'd end up.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Yeah, I figure it would take me to a login account, and I did say it did say the login that I could log in with my Ds log on. Still, I didn't say that it was completely shut down.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Yet, so I see that I can do that or I can go to my healthy business.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Id me or login that gov so.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Okay. And can you tell me what you would do next?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
For me. I would, I guess, since I already have one.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:57.000
It's kinda different. But because of the email, I I would click on, create an account with login dugup. Cause that's what the email was at.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Okay.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Okay. Earlier, you mentioned that the email said that you needed to log in with Ds log on with.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I would probably jump because the email was saying that they were gonna go away from Ds. Logon.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I would probably create, go to create an account with logit.gov.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Okay, okay, well, today, we're going to imagine that you're gonna sign in with Ds logon.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So you can click and we're gonna pretend that you've entered in your username and password.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Yup, and before we read in detail, can you describe to me what we're looking at?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So it looks like once I got logged in, it's saying that it's taking me.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Away, taking me away from the Vg.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So it looks to me like it's gonna automatically take me to login.gov, or I can click to stay here if I wanna not do it right there.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Okay. And why do you think this appeared on your screen?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I'm guessing. It's just because the email where it stated that login was gonna be required after the Dsloga went away.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And so I'm just guessing it's trended now to get you that way, to get you to take care of it. Now.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Okay? And do you have any initial questions after?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I don't think so.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
What do you expect to happen next?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I mean at this point, just to get done. I'd probably click on. Continue to login.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:49.000
. Gov. And go through that process to create the new account.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Okay.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Okay, so let's go ahead and setup login.gov.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And on the next couple of screens I'd like for you to describe out loud what you would do next.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Okay.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
If you have a question. So what we would do on this page.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So on this page. It looks like if I already had a login.gov, I would sign in with username or email password and if I didn't, it does say, first time, user create an account.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So as a first time user, I could create an account and click, create account.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Do you have any concerns about this page?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
I don't think so. It looks pretty straightforward to me.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Okay, so let's so in this scenario, remember, the email wanted you to create an account.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:50.000
So we're gonna click, create.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And what would you do on this screen?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
So it's just asking me for Microsoft.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
So it enter my email, then my language preference, and then there's a rules of view.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:11.000
So opening that and remaining, and then clicking, I read, I read, I read an accept, and then looks like, continue to continue on the front.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Great. Let's imagine that you've done just that and press.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Continue!

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And what would you do here?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So it looks like. According to this, it sent me an email.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Was a link to confirm that I entered the current email.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So I go back to my email and confirm that link.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And then, and it's this check email so I'm guessing this link will take me.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I don't know. Receive an email.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So I guess if I probably if I I'm guessing, like most websites, go to email, confirm it.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:16.000
This maybe goes away like some with you, confirm or automatically confirms for you on the screens are on waiting. And then if it didn't, if I didn't receive that email, then I can resend it or I can try a different email address, if that, didn't work, I can enter a different email.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000
How would you check your email if, like, what device would you use?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I mean, I have a laptop at home, but use my phone more than I use anything, so probably might be.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Okay, so let's click check email and pretend that you've gone to go check your email.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And you can go ahead and read this page and tell me what you would do next.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So it took me my email, it brought me to the email to confirm it.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So looks like if I just click confirm email address, it'll confirm me.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
So I'll put the I will click to come from email address link in the box.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Okay, let's go ahead and confirm.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And what would you do here?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So it's asking me to create a password.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:38.000
It has to be at least 12 characters, so I could create it, and that looks like it has the strength bar here is kind of show me if it's a good password, if it has enough characters and stuff in it, and then just click continue and if I have any questions, of my

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
password. It looks like there's the quick link Tips.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
To check, answer those questions which is nice?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Thanks. Yes. So let's pretend that you've entered in a password and click control.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And can you describe this page to me?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So it looks like it's just trying to set up another option for security to get into login numbers, which is what I did, that.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So I have. I have the touch unlocked the fingerprint unlocked, but it gives other options.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:34.000
A government id are they authentication, application, text or voice, or the list of codes?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I'm sorry. It looks like I would just click one of those and then click, continue.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And which option would you choose?

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I went with the face or touch of mock, so probably, that one.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Okay, yeah. So let's click on that one.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And then imagine they've set this up.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.000
So press, continue!

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Okay.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Okay, so what about this page? Can you describe?

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
The screen that you're seeing.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
So it looks like it set up the touch code for me.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And then it's give me an option if I wanna add another one.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Another method, I'm I'm guessing it'd be one of the other 4.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Or 5 options that were on the last page I'm guessing I would click on one another option to give me another backup.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:32.000
One in case, or I could skip it and move on to the next.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Okay? And what would you do on this screen?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I would probably just skip a, since I already have a password in my subprint that would probably just skip, for now.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Okay.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Okay.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Well, today, we are going to skip for now. So tell me about this screen that you're seeing.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:06.000
What do you think this means?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
So it looks like it's basically confirming my email and just making sure this is the email.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:19.000
It's going to v, 8, so that they can user to connect my account.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Okay? And before you click on anything, what do you expect to happen when you click, agree and continue?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:46.000
I'm guessing. It'll probably take me to the login screen to actually login. But I'm not sure.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Okay, let's click a green. Continue and see where we end up.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Now, before we talk about the screen, I'd like to reflect on what just happened in your own words.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Can you tell me what you just did?

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:17.000
So it looks like, because I I went through this whole process, and I set up my and password and all that stuff and I've confirmed my email this is actually the login page.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
So this is the homepage from my when I log in.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:32.000
This is what I see with, you know, with my information. So it looks like it actually just took me right to the login screen, which is awesome. I don't want to go back and re type. It all in.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Which Login screen.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Via va.com. It looks like.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Okay.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Do you have any concerns about what just happened?

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Hmm, Nope, I actually like it since, like I said on usually once you set up an account, wasn't you know, any entity you save your account, and you still have to go back in and type everything into a gate logged in once?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
It says your. So this is kind of nice that it actually just takes you there email to go back and.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Okay, okay, yeah. So like, so you like that. After that whole process, it already brought you back, signed it.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Yeah.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Great.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:46.000
So I'm gonna give you a a second to read through this screen, and I'd like you to summarize to me.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000
So it looks like the login that I created works only on the Va website.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:59.000
If I'm trying to go government website, I had to go back in and verify my identity with login.gov.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Okay.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
If there was an issue on this page, what would you do?

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Looks like there's a.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
If you had a yeah, if you had a question.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Looks like there's a link in blue underline that says that I can verify.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I can learn more on verify. My journey with Login Dup.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:27.000
So just click the link and go to that page and see what it said.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Okay.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.000
We're nearly done so. Thank you so much for answering so many of my questions today.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:44.000
So next we're going to close this popup.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And click anywhere in the top. Blue section. We're gonna pretend that you've signed out and now I'm gonna ask you to imagine that it's been a couple of months since you've set up your login gov account.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
But you've come back to your computer since then, and you're going to sign into login.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Gov, can you show me how you would sign into Login duck this time?

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Yeah, so it sounds like you would go straight to login, Dot.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Gov.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Okay. Great.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Let's imagine that you've enter in your that username and password that you've set up.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Click, sign, in.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:46.000
So before we read this in detail. Can you describe to me what we're looking at now?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:59.000
So it looks like there's not. It's allowing me to verify, verify my identity for use of logins outside of Thea.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Okay. And why do you think this screen appeared? This has appeared on your screen.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:18.000
I mean, it was the last thing that was said before that if I wanted to log into sites other than va.gov, I'd have to go back in a verify. My Denny.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
So it's just asking me to verify that identity.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Now, which is awesome cause I see that I can do so like so security benefits or fed your job application. So that's kind of nice that it the next time I log in it'll just ask me to do that and get that done with on the Va website I won't try to go to another website.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And go through all the processes already. Got my stuff saved right here, so I can just do it.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Okay, do you have any initial questions? After reading this page?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
I don't think so. Mean I was. I was wondering how long it was.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Gonna take where it tells me right here, about 20 min it tells me stuff I need to have.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:08.000
So I can gather those things before I continue. Then I can either continue or not continue so as long as I had on my documents.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
I would just continue and go and verify.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Okay. So it sounds like you would be interested in upgrading your account today.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Yeah.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000
And why do you think the Va. Is recommending that you upgrade your login?

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:41.000
I mean, since it's asking me, since the same things like social security benefits or Frederikov vacations, I'm guessing any Government websites seems to me like login.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Dot gov will be the go to login for that.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
So it's just gonna make it easier if I already have it done for any other.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Any other options that I go to for any other government websites.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Okay, yeah. So this would be the way that you would log in to those other websites.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.000
It sounds like, okay, great.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:16.000
If you chose not to upgrade your logging.com account. What do you think will happen?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Well, no man. There's a link to click it. I guess if I didn't want to, I could just click it and see where it took me.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
I'm guessing I could probably still log in. It would just be Va.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Only, and it wouldn't let me go any other government websites like I said before.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Okay, if you had a question about this screen, what would you do?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:58.000
I would definitely click to learn more about verifying and see if that took me to.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
A page, or I could close this out and go to the contact.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Us. Page up here on the Va website. Go through those channels.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Okay.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
That sounds good. Okay. So we've covered a lot today.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
And I just want to spend a couple of minutes now reflecting before we wrap up.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Can you summarize what it is that you did today as you click through that prototype?

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Yes, I created login.gov account pretty straightforward. A step by step.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Walkthrough, and then I went through the verification process, verifying my identity what's Login and Gov?

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:58.000
And was able to get all signed in, and then we got to the point where I was asking me about verifying for a non va login.gov account and going through that process.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Okay, thanks for that. Out of everything that you looked at today.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Is there anything that sticks out to you? Something that may have been confusing or interesting?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
No, I mean like I said before, I like that one.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:18.000
I create the account. I didn't have to go and enter all those credentials, you know, into a login bar again.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:24.000
I was just cause. If I go to try to log into something, and then I have to create an account.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Sometimes I get frustrated. That I have to go and enter everything I just entered, just to get logged in.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000
I like that. This took me, and just let me log right in I was already logged in once I entered that went through the verification process.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
I was where I wanted to go. In the first place.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Okay, that's great. Is there anything that we could do to make it easier for you to set up a login account to use with the Va.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
You already have one. But imagine, if you.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:02.000
I don't think so. I mean, this is pretty straightforward I mean, what's the with the tabs to be able to the links to be able to ask questions or learn more?

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Those are nice to have those on each page. So if I do run into an issue, I just quit those.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:13.000
I think it would be pretty, self-explanatory, explanatory, straightforward.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Okay, cool. That's great. Thank you for that. Those are all the questions that I have for you today.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Do you have any questions for me?

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
I don't think so.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Okay, cool. Well, we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Your feedback is so helpful as we continue to work on this site and make sure it really works for veterans before you go.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:47.000
I would do, wanted to make sure. It's clear that everything that we did today wasn't real. So you haven't actually set up an an additional login dug of account that you already have.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.000
And you can continue signing in, as you normally do.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:02.000
And lastly, perigee will be sending a thank you with a Thank you. Note with little blurbs that you can pass along to any other veterans that you may know to provide them with the chance to participate in feature. Research studies they'll also be in touch about payment as well thank you so

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
much again, and enjoy the rest of your day.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000
You as well. Thank you so much.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Yeah.How are you too.
