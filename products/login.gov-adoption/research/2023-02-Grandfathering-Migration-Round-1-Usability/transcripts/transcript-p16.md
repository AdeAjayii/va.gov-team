### Transcript

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000

> Okay, great. So are you comfortable if I record this session today?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000

> Yes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000

> Awesome, alrighty! Well, let's start by learning a little bit more about your experience with the VA and some of our online services. How long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000

> Over 30 years.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000

> Okay, so quite a while. And how often would you say you go online to access or manage anything related to the VA?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000

> Maybe once or twice a month I go on for different things. Maybe check benefits. But since I worked on transitioning over to healthcare, I kinda go in that way to get to my healthy vet, too, and talk to my doctor.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000

> Okay, gotcha. So it sounds like you're starting you're sometimes starting on my healthy vet. And then, when when you're looking at your benefits, do you know which website that you start from to going to look at that?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So I go into the old, my E-bits website because that will, it will transition over to the new website without me having to do it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Extra layer of authentication.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Okay. Okay, so tell me more about that. What's it like when you start the process?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If you can kind of walk me through that.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So, go to my e-bits. And then, when I have the main screen on, I'm usually looking at disabilities to check the status of things.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I have ongoing. I click on disabilities, and then it it will bring up what I have.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That's currently in the queue. Then I will just select one of those items.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Okay.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
One of the disability claims that I have there.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I click on that and then it will bring up the status, whether it's a gathering evidence.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Reviewing, evidence. Whatever the case may be, and it will say at the top there will be a blue layer that said, Try our new website, and I'll go there because that gives it almost get that other website.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Okay.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Almost gives me a different level of detail that's that's easier to read.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Gotcha. Okay.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000
But I mean I don't usually go right to the new website because there is an extra layer of authentication that's kind of a pain, and I don't have to do it.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
If I go through, he benefits first.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Right? Okay, that's really helpful. I think I'm following.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So it sounds like you're going in through benefits.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Do you know which sign in method you use when you're on the E benefits website?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Yeah, I use, yeah, ds, login.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Okay, great. So it sounds like you start any benefits you sign in with thes log on, and then eventually, you probably end up at Va Dot.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Yeah.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Gov, it sounds like that might be the new website. Okay? Great.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And that's a bit easier for you. You find, rather than starting on va.gov.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Yes. Yeah.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And signing in there. Great. Okay. That makes sense. That's really helpful.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Do you remember the last time that you signed in?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Probably let me see, would have been about a week ago, when I did a refill on my medications.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Okay. So that would have been probably on my healthy bet.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Yeah. Yeah. But but I go into the the Va portal first to get there.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Okay, okay, Gotcha. So there's a couple of different places that you're kind of comfortable. Starting from.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And when you went into the Va portal, do you know which sign in method you would use to refill your prescription?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Yeah, so I use Ds.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Okay. Gotcha, that makes sense. So that's really helpful.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I think we'll talk a little bit more about that.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Throughout our conversation today but I think we can get started with looking at that prototype that I mentioned so what I'm going to do is send you a link in the Zoom chat and I'll send that right now and then.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I'm just gonna ask you to open this up on your ipad. And then, once that's opened up, I'm gonna ask for you to share your screen. So I'll give you a second to open the link and then let me know if you're comfortable or you're familiar with sharing your screen.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Yeah. The link just disappeared.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Okay, might be a little bit funny on the ipad.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Let me think where it might show up.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I'll send it again, and we'll see.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Okay, yeah, I got it. There.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000
If it comes up you got it. Okay.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Alrighty. So is that opening up now on your side?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Yes.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Okay, awesome. And then I think, to share your screen on the ipad. And is that something you've done before?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I have!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Okay, let me know if you need any support, and I can help walk us through it.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So so far, I don't think I'm seeing your screen.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Are you still on the zoom window? Are you on the?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I'm on the zoom window. I hit share content in the zoom window.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Okay. Okay.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And you can see that.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
No, I'm not seeing it yet, so let's think, does it look like they're at the top of your screen.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Maybe does it say something like, stop sharing?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I think, if not, it might not have started yet.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Okay, yeah. Cause, the website is still not up.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Okay.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Let me try something here. I wonder if it's that browser?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Okay. So I got the screen up. Now, I just need to.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I the link that you send me. Now we just need to figure out why this sharing is over.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Okay, perfect. Let's think it is a little funny on my end.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Sometimes you disappear, so if you're on the zoom window, do you see?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Kind of like a a bunch of different options, like muting.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And you know, chat. Oh, there we go!

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Yup, I just I found something.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Alright, I'm gonna give it a second to load.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Okay, it, looks like you're sharing your screen now, so I can see the zoom window.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And then, yeah, perfect. That's great. Okay? So I'm guessing that you can see exactly what I'm looking at.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
You've got this email on your screen, and then maybe me in the upper right hand corner. Okay, perfect.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Right.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So this, this should work. So this is an email.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
It's let's pretend that it's addressed to yourself, and what I want you to do as we start our conversation today is to imagine that this was received to you.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You got in this email from the Va and I'm gonna give you a second to read this more closely.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And what I would like for you to do is just summarize to me what this email is telling you.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Ds log on will no longer work, and you have to do login.gov.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
If you wanna access your the benefits, healthcare, etc.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Okay. And I know that you use Ds log on right now.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So as someone who's using Ds log on.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
When you read something like this, what's your reaction?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:03.000
My reaction is that the Va. Is continuing to vend out their services to private contractors.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Okay.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And and they're moving it out from under the Department of Defense.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Okay. So you I sent maybe a little bit of frustration with with realizing that.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:25.000
There's frustration there, there's frustration, and you know I've tried to get a login back before, but they want you to do this really funky authentication.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Where you have a video within. And I am just not interested in doing that.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So part of it is that your you're kind of like, oh, okay, they're contracting out to a private contractor.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And then the other part of your reaction is actually to do with your experience with Login. Gov.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Yeah.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Already! Go ahead!

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And that is, and I'm also the familiarity with Ds log on.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So that's something that I would use in the service to access different Dod websites it's just it's kind of frustrating with the change.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And you know it's frustrating when you log on to va.gov, and they are like 4 different options.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000
There? Why?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Yeah, okay, that makes total sense. So you've been using Ds log on for probably quite a while as well.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I have. Yes!

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Okay, yeah. So that makes sense. And then when you talked about the login, gov, you're kind of hesitancy with login.gov, and needing to maybe do a video, can you tell me a little bit more about your experience with login gov so far or your understanding?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Well, I was, yeah, quite probably a couple of years ago I was using login, Daca attempting to use it.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I was gonna apply for Federal civilian jobs through U.S.A.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Jobs. And that's site uses the login dot go.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:05.000
But they wanted me, you know you do this thing where you take a picture of your Id or your scan your id, and then, for whatever reason they can't read it, and then they require they want to do a video conference with you, a short video conference, to authenticate who

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
you are, to me. That's that's just too interested.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Okay.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And I know they don't work for the Government either, so I don't have a real high level of trust.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Yeah, that makes sense. Okay? So you don't it's not even just maybe the hassle of having to do something like that.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
It's actually like you don't. You might not feel comfortable with having to do something like that.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Yes.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Yeah, that's really helpful. I'm gonna give you just a second to look at this email once more.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Is there anything else that's jumping out at you?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:46.000
We've covered quite a bit already, but.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Well, it says it's a Us. Government account.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Yes.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
This account will only work for Va, digital tools.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Oh, yeah, okay. So the note, if I want to use login Daca for other sites, and I need to log out and log back in.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So tell me more about you've kind of noted a couple of things the first one you said allowed was secure. Us government account.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
What does that mean for you when it's saying got it?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
To me. It makes it sound as if it's it is a.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Government. The Government account. It resides on a government server.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Okay, does that change how you feel at all about it? Based on what we were talking about?

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
If it's true. Yes, it may. Yeah.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Okay, but still not completely confident that that might. That is the case.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
No!

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Okay. And then you also picked up on Va digital tools.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
What is the digital tools mean to you?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I assume the tools are the the different things I can do@theva.gov website.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Or when I log into it, whether it's going to my healthy vet, whether it's filing a claim, checking the status of a claim, sending messages, refills, things like that.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I assume that's what they mean by digital tools.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And the last thing that I think you mentioned was uhing to potentially log back out and log in again.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
If you were gonna use this with other government websites. Can you tell me more about that note?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
What does what does that mean for you? How would you assume that this works?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:58.000
What it sounds like to me is that it's even though it's it's a login, dot govica or login.gov account that it's kind of somehow.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Still piped into one channel at a time. In other words, you need to log out you close down your browser to clear the cash, to allow it to go into another government site.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Okay.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
That's well, so it's not like you could if if you're logged in there, you can go to all these different other government websites that require a login account.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
No, you need manually close and go back in and go through the site.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:27.000
One process, again.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Right? Okay. Gotcha. So you can't kind of go into login.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Right. So it's yeah. It's not seamless. It's not.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Dot gov, and then you have access to all the things you actually have to do it for each one.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And I I guess to a certain I certain extent, I guess well, I don't know.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I don't know if Ds log on that way or not, because I don't really use it that way.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So it sounds like, maybe, well, let's let's actually, I'll ask you about one more thing in the email.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
So one thing that it does say in here is you're creating a Va.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Only login.gov account. What does that mean?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Yeah, okay.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Means I've got another account. I've got to manage, and it's I mean, it's how are you use password?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
But I use a password keeper already. I don't.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I couldn't manage my passwords without it, and this is just another. Okay.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
So va login.gov. All other government agencies, login dot cov.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
It's just yeah.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Yeah.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Another thing to remember and to keep track of. Yeah, that makes sense.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Okay. So you know, if this was an email that you received as somebody who uses Ds log on right now, how do you think you would?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
What do you think you would do if you received this email?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
It doesn't seem like I have much of a choice.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I'd have to comply with what it says, otherwise I I lose, you know.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Access to the, you know, access to what I want information I need digitally.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Right okay, so because you're using quite a few different Va services, you would, I feel like you're kind of forced to set up this login to account.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Yeah.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Okay. Alright. Well, that's been really helpful. I think what we'll do is we're gonna continue through this, and I'm sure we'll have a similar conversation.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:26.000
So I'm gonna let you just click on. Go to va.gov to create an account.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Alright, and then tell me what we're seeing here.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
That's the screen. You see, if you go to v.gov right now.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Umhm. Okay? So looks familiar. And we've got a couple of different options like you mentioned that at the start.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Usually you would probably click on Ds log on here. Okay.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Yes.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And so based on the email that you just read, what would you do if you saw this screen?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Well, I would go to Ds log on because it said something.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000
You log on the Ds log on, and it'll help you set up your login.gov. That's what I took from it.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Yeah, okay, let's go ahead and do that.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Okay. Perfect. So we're not gonna have you enter any information today?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:16.000
So you can just click login. We'll pretend like you put in your username and password.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I'll just give this a second to load.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Hmm, okay, sticking a little bit of time.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000
It might be worth refreshing. The page I'm not sure how easy that is to do on the ipad.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Yeah, or go back that works click login once more.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Yes.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Okay, I'm gonna have to move your window here.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Yeah, perfect. Hopefully, this helps usually that will work.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Okay. So we're gonna stay on this page for a second. That's perfect.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Okay.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Alrighty. So what does this page telling you?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
It's just it's a jump linking me to login.gov.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Okay? And so if you were, you know, in this process of setting up a login.gov account, what do you think you would do next?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Probably continue to login go.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Okay, let's go ahead and click on that.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Okay, so what does this screen here? If you can describe it to me?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Yeah, this is a typical new account set up screen. Or if you're an existing user sign in with your your credentials.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Okay. And so what would you probably do on this page?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Create an account.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Okay, let's go ahead and click on. Create an account.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Alright, and then for the next couple of screens, I'd like you to do the same thing.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:18.000
So just describe to me what you would do next, and then we'll talk about it.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
If you have any questions or anything comes up.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Yeah, enter in my email address, lead the default language. I probably wouldn't read it.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
I probably would not read and accept the login that Gov.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
But I would check the box and hit, continue.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Okay, let's go ahead and click that box, and then we can hit. Continue.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Okay, what are we seeing on this screen?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Yeah, this is you signed up with your email. And it's gonna basically send you an email to that account.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
So they know it's you.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Yeah, that's familiar.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Okay, is that something that feels familiar for you? Yeah. And right now, we're on your ipad is setting up an account like this.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Something that you might do on your ipad.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I might, but but I'm more likely to do it on my desktop computer.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Get to a large monitors there, that that is just a lot easier to use.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:24.000
Yeah, that makes sense. So if we were on your desktop computer, how would you check your email?

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Would you check that on your desktop computer as well?

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Yeah, I check it on. There. I just open up my Microsoft outlook that has all my different email accounts going in there.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And then I just look for the email in there.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Okay, great. So for today, you can just go ahead and click check email.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000
And then we'll continue on to this next screen. So we're just imagining that you're checking your email right now.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And you receive something like this.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
So that's in my email.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
And then click on that, and then it probably redirect me back to the login.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Website.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
Okay, great. So that sounds pretty straightforward for you. We can continue on.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Yeah.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:11.000
You can go ahead and click, confirm email, address.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Alrighty! What are we saying here?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
The dreaded password, creation, screen.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:32.000
And why is it dreaded?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Okay.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
So this is. This is where I can currently have my password keeper open, and I would have it generate a hard password for me, and then I would drop it in there and then make sure it met all the parameters, and save it and both on this screen and my password keeper.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Okay, Gotcha. So it sounds like you have a bit of a system for how you would do this.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Yeah.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
I like, I said. I can't remember my passwords, especially when I get so long, and the requirements are so varied.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
For sure, so you'd probably generate a really strong pass through, store it right away, and then you would continue on, okay, yeah, that's helpful.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Yup! Yup! Yup!

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Okay, well, let's imagine you've done something like that.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:10.000
And then we'll go ahead and click, continue.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
So what are we seeing here?

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Oh, good Lord! I'm seeing a lot of 2 factor authentication options.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000
Okay? And you said, Good Lord! Can you tell me a little bit about how you're feeling when you see a page like this?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:34.000
There are a lot of them, and my only my only question would be, I.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:44.000
So I use a 2 factor, authenticator to log in, and most websites nowadays it'll generate the code and I punch it in.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
I got away from the text messaging that works great on my computer and my laptop.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:22:00.000
But the mobile apps. Pardon my language, they suck cause, even if you were to select face or touch, unlock a biometric option, it never works.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000
It always ask you to enter stuff in again. So this is great for the website.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
And I, you know, if I'm here I would just go with the fetterer application.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
It'll pop up with a QR. Code.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Okay.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
I'll scan it, add it, and I'm good to go. But there's just a lot of options here, and I wonder how many people that's gonna confuse.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Yeah, okay. Alright. So you're seeing like, almost too many options here.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
And then, from your experience like you've started to move towards using authentication app.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Yeah.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000
So you might use that, but might still have concerns about how that will work on Mobile.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Well, yeah, cause currently, it doesn't work on mobile.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Okay. Gotcha.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
I mean alright, and I use both Android and Ios, and it is about a 70.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:49.000
30 doesn't work to work ratio. So it's just very sketchy.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Okay. Gotcha, alrighty. So you have a little bit of hesitance.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:57.000
But also quite a bit of experience. Now with using 2 factor authentication.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Yeah.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
So let's go ahead and set up the authentication application.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000
So you can go ahead and get ready to do that.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Alright perfect. And then tell me what you're seeing on this screen.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Yeah, so this is what I expect to see. You name it.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:24.000
And then I, on this instance I would open up my Microsoft authenticator app I would add a new one by clicking the add button, and then with scan, that QR.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Code, and then it would add it to my index of 2 factor accounts. I have.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Okay, perfect. So sounds familiar. You already have the application and you'd kind of know exactly what to do here.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Yeah.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
That's perfect. We can go ahead and continue on.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
So we'll pretend, like you entered in that code from the application.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
And then we'll see this screen here.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Okay.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Alright! So what's the screen telling us?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Well!

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.000
I've added my first authentication method.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
But that green note up there with the check is puzzling, because I don't remember adding a text.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Invoice message added to my account.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Yeah, that is puzzling, and I'll be honest with you.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
I think that's just a symptom of this being an early prototype.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.000
So what I would expect to see is not that check thing I would.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:30.000
I probably had another method which I would probably use my a text message on my cell phone.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
So I, yeah, that's what I can do here.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Okay, yeah, okay, perfect. And then for today, we're just gonna skip that.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:42.000
But it sounds like you'd know what you would set up as as a second method, and you might actually go ahead and do that.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Yup!

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:49.000
That's perfect. Okay, we can click on skip for now and then let me know what you're saying next.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Count, set up complete, agree, and continue.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Umhm. Alright. So before we continue on this screen, what does it mean by your account? Setup is complete. If you can just tell me in your own words.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Means. I have a valid username password and 2 factor authentication for security.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Okay, great. And why is it saying that it's gonna share this information with the Va.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Because it's only good for the any for Va. Access.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Okay.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Nothing else, and I but I so I don't know what the sharing with the da mean.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
So it's it's obviously not the Va that houses this.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
If it's going to be shared with the Va.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Right? Okay? So it's a little confusion, cause you're not sure, are you?

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Who do you think houses this? If that's if it's not the Va.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
I would imagine it's some third party contractor whether it's whoever it is, is Google Services or Microsoft Azure.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.000
I'm not sure.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Okay, Gotcha. And then, if we clicked, agree and continue, what are you expecting to see next?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000
They probably take me back to the hey? Either sign me out of login.gov, and take me to like a main home screen.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
It's probably what it would do.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Okay? And when you say a main home screen, can you tell me what kind of website you're you're imagining?

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Well, I hope it would redirect me back to Ava website.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000
That's what I would hope.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000
Okay, alrighty. So let's click on a green, continue, and we'll see what happens next.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Okay. So before we read this too closely, what kind of website does it look like we're on right now?

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Looks like it's the va.org website.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Okay, so sounds kind of what you were expecting to find.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Uhhuh.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Okay. And we're seeing something kind of pop up here.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
I'm just gonna we're just gonna leave that for a second.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
And I wanna just reflect on what you've just done.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000
So this might feel a little repetitive. But can you tell me what we've just done?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
So everything that happened up until this point.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
So we we basically went soup to nuts.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Attempt looking at all the options to log into the Va.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Government website came to a screen that had the 4 options.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I selected Ds Log on, which is what I would usually do then it it took me to a you need to set up a new account because the Va.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Is eliminating the Ds log on. So you need to do a login.gov, you need to go through.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:46.000
That set that account up, go through the authentication, verify your email, and then, after it's done all that and and you verified everything.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Then it's gonna take you to the logged in version of the website.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
My only not my question. Just the thought!

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Yeah.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:05.000
So at the very beginning, when we're given those 4 options to log on if we're getting rid of Ds log on, and I click on Ds log on, do I need to go to another screen?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Tell me we're getting rid of Dsl Login, and I need to make a Ds log. Login. Gov.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Right.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Account, because it seems like there could be a note right there on that 4 option page if you click on Ds log on you, you will be asked to create a or login.gov account it seems that it puts in an extra click and any to me it's

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
okay, but a lot of people might might get hung up at that part.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Yeah, okay, that's really helpful. Why do you think that like, was there any purpose of signing into Dslog on first?

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Nope, Nope. No purpose at all.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Okay, yeah, okay, that makes sense. So you're almost imagining, like, why didn't I just go straight to login.gov, and set up the account if that's what I have to do.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Correct. Yup, yup.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. And your summary is really helpful.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
So I think we'll continue on now. So we're looking at this screen.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:12.000
I'll give you a second to read this more closely.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Okay, so the one, the last part of that. The second sentence you'll need to go back to Login.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Go to verify your identity. If you want to use login dotup for other accounts.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:36.000
So I can't use. Well, can I? I guess I'm not really clear what that means.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Yeah, that makes sense. You're not exactly sure what you can use login dot go for, and what you can.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Right, yeah.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Okay, and what about verify your identity? What does that mean?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
What do you think that integrates?

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:58.000
I would assume. It's it. Well, I I don't really know.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
That's kind of nebulous, I mean, do I need to log in to something?

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Do I need to provide a social security number, date of birth?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Do I need to do another email check? I mean, I really don't know what it means.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So it seems like it's pretty clear we've set up a login Gov account.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
We signed in with the login.gov account, and we are on va.gov right now.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:30.000
But it's not necessarily clear where else you could or couldn't use the Login Gov account.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
And then also what it means by verifying your identity.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Right.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. So let's imagine that.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Now you know we've signed in with login. Gov.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
And you wanted to go and complete one of those tasks that you regularly do. So.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Let's say, refill your prescription like you just did recently.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
What would you do next on this screen?

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Yeah, close this out.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Okay.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000
I would click on my help.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Okay, yeah, perfect. So like, I said at the start, not everything's gonna work. When you click it.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Okay. Okay.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:13.000
So that's perfect. For now but it seems like it was pretty easy for you to close the pop up and kind of move on would you have any hesitation about being able to now complete.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Those regular tasks that you used to do when you signed in with the S. Log on.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000
No!

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Now that you've signed in with login. Gov, okay?

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Still, seems like you'd be able to continue and use the Va website just like you used to.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Right.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense alright. So we've answered quite a lot of my questions so far.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:44.000
The next thing I'm gonna have you do is just click anywhere in that dark part of the top bar on the screen, and we're gonna imagine that you've now signed out.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Okay. So it's been a couple of weeks since you set up this login.gov account to use with the Va.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.000
You've signed out. And and today you're coming back online because you needed to.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Let's say you needed to refill a different prescription, so can you show me how you would sign in to start?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Well, I since I know what it's gonna do, I would click on refill and track your prescriptions, and it would just ask me to log in anyhow.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Yeah. Gotcha. Okay? So you'd go straight for the task that makes sense.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Yeah.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:21.000
For today. I'm gonna have you click sign in up in the top right corner just because we can't click on everything on this on this yet.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
But that's perfect. You click sign in there. Okay? And so now we're seeing the sign in screen.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
And how are we gonna choose to sign in today?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Not Ds log on, so I click on login dot go.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Okay? And how come you're saying, not Ds log on.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Because cause they take me to another screen.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Tell me to set up and log in. Go account, and I already have one.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
So, yeah.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Okay. Right? Alright. So based on the previous experience, you would say, like, I guess I'm not supposed to use that anymore.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
I'll use the Login Gov. Account.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Right, and maybe a note here kind of saying, if you previously established the login.gov account, do not select this option.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Right? Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So let's click on login.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Gov, and we'll go ahead and pretend like we're signing in with Login.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
So, yeah.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Gov again. We're not gonna put information in, but go ahead.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Yeah, enter my username or my email address my password and then click, sign it.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Okay, perfect. Let's click on sign in.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Alright, and then we're seeing some more information on this page.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:34:07.000
So I'm gonna just start by giving you some time to read this.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Okay.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Okay? So first of all, just how, what's your reaction when you're reading this here?

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Why?

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Tell me more about that.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
I mean, I'm going to va.com.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
I am not trying to add any other government website.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
I mean the interesting thing about thes log on, and I'll use this as a reference point.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:45.000
There was a link I could click that would show you can use Ds log on to to log into all these government websites.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
It would list them all with all the hyperlinks.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Well!

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:56.000
If I was on it on a page like that, and I wanted to go another one, then I'd expect this to pop up.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Right.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
But if I'm worried about anyhow, why do this?

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Right, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So you're not currently like trying to go onto another government website.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Correct.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000
So this feels kind of out of place. Okay? And if it was, let's say that you wanted to go to another government website.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:30.000
And you wanted to see this pop up. Maybe when you tried to access that website, what do you think it would be asking you to do in order to get access to that to that next government website.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Probably what the lower left button says verify your identity on login.gov.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Okay. We've talked about that a little bit throughout our conversation.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
But what would that mean if you can kinda describe to me what you'd expect to do?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
So I think I would expect to do a process very similar to the login.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Dot gov for the Va. But setting up, it sounds like I'd set up.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Is it a entirely new login? Govcom, for another government?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Or entity? Or is it? Can I use the same credentials?

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
I just need to verify my identity. It's I'm not really clear what that means.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So based on what you've done already with the Va, you might expect that you have to do something similar with the next government website.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:24.000
But then that gets a little complicated with like, am I setting up another login?

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Right, right.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Gov account. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Is there anything else that's jumping out to you as you read this?

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Once your identity has been verified, you can use your login.com account to not only va digital tools, but also manage other government benefits.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Hmm! That I'm reading that I'm kind of.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Okay, there seems to be contradictory.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Messaging seems like I need a login. Gov.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Account for the Va. Specifically to do Va. Things.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:28.000
Use va digital tools, but then here it says, it appears to say, if you verify your identity again, you cannot add only use login for the Va.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Uhhuh. Okay.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
But you can use it for these other things. That's what I'm taking from there.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Yeah, and when you're saying it's contradictory, I think I'm following along.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:44.000
So what does it feel? What does this feel like? It's contributing from what you were previously told or did.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Because the messaging behind signing in for login, Daca for Va was that it was just for the Va digital only tools.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Right.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:08.000
And you needed to verify your identity for all these other things, and I have not yet established whether verifying my identity means I can use the same credentials, and I just need to show you a state issued id or if I have to set up a whole new credentials.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Right.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
So that part there is kind of fuzzy.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Right, and because that parts a little fuzzy, it's almost hard to understand the rest of the message.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Well, it just leaves me. Okay, so this is like the Aha moment.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Yeah.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:32.000
So why didn't you just ask me to do the whole thing at the beginning? And we could just dispense with all these little Va digital tools only not be a digital dissolving whatever?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense I think that's been really, really helpful to hear how you've kind of noted throughout the process, like where things might be different.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:39:01.000
I'm curious. So at the very beginning, when we started talking about login Gov, we talked about maybe an apprehension to doing something like remote video where you have to show your Id, or if felt a little bit intrusive, I think is how you described it does this right?

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Here where it's saying you need these things to verify your identity.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Does it feel like you're going to need to do something like that?

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Yup. It does!

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Okay, okay? And I'm curious. So obviously, that's happening remotely you're on a call.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Maybe like this, it sounds like it's how you're imagining it.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:21.000
And you're showing somebody your Id, or you're taking a picture of your Id.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Would that process feel any different if you were doing it in person with someone?

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Yeah, I mean, cause I guess that's kind of how I'm used to doing those types of things is in person.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Yeah, okay, does it feel less intrusive for you?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Or maybe just more familiar.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Probably just more for that way.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Okay. So if there was an option for you to do something like, verify your identity in person, that might be something that you're more interested in rather than doing it online.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Yeah, it? Yeah, I mean, it's depending on what I mean.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Where am I going to do it? The thing with this is so, t yeah, you take it to take a picture of your state.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Id, and if the for some reason, when you submit the email to them with the attachment, or however you send it to them, if the text isn't rendable, and that's when you get the feedback, hey?

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Gotcha!

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
You need to get on a call with us to, so we can do it in person.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000
So I just I mean, but then again, so I mean all 3 of those things to verify my identity so that's kind of sounds like the same path.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
It's going down.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Gotcha. Okay? So from your experience, like, you would first have to maybe take a picture or enter these things in.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
And then, if they couldn't access it, or for whatever reason, then, you might have to get on a call with somebody.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Correct.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Okay. Gotcha at at the, you know.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Start. We didn't ask you to verify your identity.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:15.000
We kind of let you set up the login gov account, and then later on, we're asking, you know, if you want to verify your identity, you can access other government websites, and you noted that you know may why didn't they just kind of ask me to do this?

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
From the beginning.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Can you tell me a little bit more about that? I think it's a.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Interesting.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
The thing that you've come upon.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Well, to me it seems it's almost like a switch invade because all the messaging upfront was okay.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:56.000
You need to set up this account to use Va digital tools, and it's only good for that purpose.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Yeah.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Then we go through this entire, this.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Call it elongated, whatever for some people it's longer than others.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Setup process, and then you go back to. And this looks like.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
The first time I've freshly logged into the Va dot go website.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:16.000
After I said everything, and then it's like, Oh, by the way, you know, we we could do this.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Right.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
It's like, so, okay, so and this is actually where I initially gave up on this a while back was what I got to this point, and they couldn't read my idea.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Yeah.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
I said, forget it. I just I don't have time for it, so it seems like you're doing.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:38.000
You're doing twice the effort for the same result. But we've also planted a seat in someone's mind that that lock in dock is only good for the da digital tools.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Yeah, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So it's like, maybe over complicating things a little bit.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:46.000
And also I think you use the term switch in bait.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
So we've kind of changed what we're saying.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
It feels like on the screen. From what we said previously, yeah, that's really, really helpful.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Yup correct. Right.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:01.000
What if you know this process started from your interaction with the Va.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
So let's say you were going into a Va healthcare facility, and someone said, You know you need to set up a login.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Gov. Account. We can do it right now, and we can.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:16.000
We can check your Id. What would your reaction be? And you know we have to be a little bit hypothetical here.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
But what do you think you would realistically respond if someone had offered you?

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Oh, that'd be great, especially if you had a self service terminal or something on the way way into the clinic or the hospital or whatnot and you could kind of go through the process there, if that's what it needed.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:40.000
But that especially when you're talking about a veteran population may not be as savvy with technology.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
I'm somewhat savvy you're gonna there, me a lot of people who will really struggle.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Getting to this point.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Okay. Gotcha. So you think it would maybe avoid some of the like technical complications of having to try this on your own.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000
Correct.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Yeah, that makes sense. Well, that's been really helpful.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
I don't know if there's anything else on this screen that that I needed to ask you about.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000
But is there anything else you wanted to talk about here?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
No, no, that's pretty straightforward.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Okay. Great. Well, you can go ahead and stop sharing your screen hopefully.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
That's simple enough on zoom.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Yeah, perfect.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
There we go. So we're almost finished. So we're about to wrap up.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:32.000
It sounds like you had a pretty good understanding of what we were trying to do today.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
And as a Ds log on user, it was really interesting to understand how you might react to receiving an email like that.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
I think I've covered, you know, all my questions for today.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
But was there anything else that you wanted to add about anything we talked about?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000
From our conversation.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000
No, not really. I mean, I think it's moving in the right direction.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:45:02.000
I just say keep the messaging as simple as possible, because I guess we we developed these things.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
You have to develop them for the person who has the smallest knowledge base.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
So, yeah.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
For sure. Yeah, yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:19.000
And it's really helpful to know where things have gotten overly complicated or could have been a little bit more simple.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Yeah.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
So I appreciate that a lot from our conversation. Well, I think those are all my questions.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
And did you? Wanna did you have any other questions for me?

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
No, no, I don't. Pretty straightforward. I appreciate the time.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Okay. Well, I appreciate your time. It's been really helpful, like I said we could not do the work that we do without getting feedback.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000
And you know, having these conversations with veterans like yourself.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000
So been really helpful, there's a couple of things I wanted to cover before we wrap up.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
So Parian or Parian. The folks who set up this interview they're going to send you a thank you.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Note after the interviews finished, and it's just going to have a little blurb which you're welcome to share with other veterans if they wanted to get involved.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Okay.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
In something like this, and then they're also going to be the ones that manage your payment.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000
So if you have any questions about that, you just let them know.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000
I also wanted to just kind of clear up.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
I know you're using Dslog on right now to sign in with the Va.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000
And everything that we were looking at right now is not real.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000
So you can continue to access your Va. Services.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Has, how you have been. And yeah, I think that's everything.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Thank you so much again.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Okay, yeah, I appreciate those comments. Thank you.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Yeah, thank.You too.
