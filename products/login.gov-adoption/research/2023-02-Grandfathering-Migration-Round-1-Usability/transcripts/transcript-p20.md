00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So okay, great. So I'll start the recording. And then, after I start the recording, I'm gonna actually have to ask you that to confirm one more time.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Great. So I started recording. And I just wanna confirm, are you comfortable?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If I record my screen and the audio as we talk today.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That's fine!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Okay, thanks. So much. Alright. So we've gotten through that kind of introduction.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Do you have any questions for me at this point?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
No!

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Okay.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Okay.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Awesome. Well, I like I mentioned. We're here to learn a little bit more about how you use some of the Va's online services, and specifically how you sign in to them.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So I'm gonna ask you some questions just to get to know a little bit more about your experience before we start looking at that prototype that I mentioned.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Okay.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Okay to start. How long have you been a veteran?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Since 1990.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Okay, a little while.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And what about going online to access Va services?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Have you been doing that since the nineties, or a little more recently?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
No, no, it's probably just been in the last couple of years, you know.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
As technology advances, there's always changes. So.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Umhm, yeah. Do you remember what kinda introduced you to?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Some of the Va's online services. When you first started going online.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Mike, do you know, basically explain that you can go online to contact them?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
If you have questions to briefly your prescriptions, look at any test results.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So get started. There.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Okay, great, yeah, that makes sense. So you were talking to your doctors.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And were they telling you about Mit that? Does that sound familiar?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Yeah, that's what I normally use. They do offer 2 options, but I have to.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The second option with id me, or whatever it says. But I've not been able to get through.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So I just continue with my healthy bit.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Gotcha alrighty. So when you're when you're signing in, it sounds like you're using my healthy bet to sign in id dot.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Me is not really working for you. Do you know which website you're on when you're when you're going online to access to talk to your doctor, for example.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Do you mean like windows, or something, or chrome? Is that what you referring to?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Not so much so, I guess I mean, what would you type in if you were gonna go online to talk to your doctor?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
What would you start with?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Okay. Oh, I just put in my healthy bit.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Okay, so you're on the myhealthy, that website.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Correct.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And then you use my healthy that to sign in. Okay, that's helpful.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And so when was the last time you signed into my healthy bet?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Do you remember?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Yesterday.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Okay, how often do you feel like you're signing into my healthy that?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Well, lately I've been using it a lot because I have missed a couple of appointments and it's very frustrating because I live in Apollo Beach and when I have to travel to Tampa missing an appointment is upsetting and I called

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:33.000
acupuncture yesterday, because I had received a message that they had tried to call me wondering why wasn't at my appointment, and I said, My point is not to the 11.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Oh no!

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.000
She's like. No, dear, it was just today. I'm like, Oh, my God!

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Oh, gotcha!

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And now I don't have an appointment until May thirty-first, so I'm not happy because my acupuncture and physical therapy they go hand in hand.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So I went on there to double check, to make sure that all the appointments that were in the system or in my phone.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Hmm!

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So I didn't have any other issues. And then there was medication that I had try to refill.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I never got any medication. Oh, I had to actually go to the Va pharmacy in Tampa to find out why, and they said, Well, you don't have any more refills.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I'm like what so then I had to come back home and go into my healthy bed.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Right? Okay.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Send a message to my doctor in order for her to refill the prescription, so I could get my medicine so it's it's been a little frustrating, because there were times when I would go into the system, and there was nothing there. There.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Right.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Were no doctors, I couldn't access the pharmacy, and I was having to call.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So I go. What is wrong with my healthy vet, because I'm not able to see any information at all, so I don't know if the system was down or they were working on it.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I really don't know, but that was kind of aggravating.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Yeah, okay, so it sounds like a couple of moments that we're aggravating for you in the last couple of weeks.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Maybe so. That sounds a little bit frustrating. And you mentioned that you are using myheldy vet on your computer at home.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Do you ever access my help? You bet, from your phone?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Sometimes.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Okay. Well, that's really helpful. And what about other?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Va, websites. Have you been to any other Va websites besides my healthy?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
That!

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Do you mean, as far as like going into Va administration?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Yeah, that might be one.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Okay, up in the regional office. I've used it for that, and I've also had to.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Well, everything, I guess, would basically be under Va.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Gotcha!

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Administration where I've had to update my banking, information, address or contact them because of fraud, or ask questions about my home.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
You know, varies different parts of Va. Administration.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful. And when you're on the Va.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Administration website? Are you usually signing in as well?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Okay.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Yes, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Okay, tell me more about that.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I don't know.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I have so many passwords, and when I change them I always write them down and say, I went into the website today with the password that I wrote down tomorrow.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It doesn't work.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And then then I have to call, and they're like, well, you know.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Try to reset it and go other these extra steps. I mean, you're trying to do something.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
You just want it to work, so I don't know why a password work one day, and then it doesn't work.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
The next day. So that's been a really big issue.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Right? Yeah, that makes sense. Okay, Gotcha. And when you're on the Va administration website, how are you signing in?

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Do you remember which kind of method you're using to sign in?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
No, I can sign in through my healthy vet.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Gotcha. Okay? So you'll use my healthy vet when you're on the my healthy, dot website, or when you're on the Va.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000
That's correct.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Administration website, Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Is there anything else that you want to share with me more generally about signing in before we move on?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I don't know if the other option under id me would be better than signing into my healthy vet, but I can't comment because I can't get in it.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Yeah, yeah, that sounds like, so you've tried.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And you've not been able to set it up.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000
No!

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Yeah, okay, that's really helpful to know. And I think, actually, we're gonna talk about that a little bit more throughout the rest of the conversation.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000
So I'll ask you a couple more questions about Id.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Dot me in a little bit. So that's very helpful.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So I mentioned a prototype when we first got on the call, and so I'm gonna send you a link in the chat on Zoom, and what I'd like for you to do is just open up this link on your computer.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Once you open up the link, I'm gonna ask you to share your screen. Is that something you're familiar with doing?

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I think so. We'll see.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Okay. Okay. Well, I'm gonna talk you through it. If not.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Okay.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So I sent the link in the chat. If you can just open that up, and then once you open it up, let me know what it looks like that you're seeing on your computer.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Do you want me to open up the link because it says, Tyler, do you want me to click on that cause?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
That's what I did. Excellent!

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Yes, please. Yeah, that's perfect.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And then let me know if that link loads, and then what it looks like when it loads.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Okay, it. Shows v a. U. S. Department of veteran affairs. Va.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Okay, that's.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Benefits and health care about Va. And then each one has a dropdown box, and it shows healthcare disability. Education records.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Okay, that's helpful. So what I'm gonna have you do now is I'm gonna help you with sharing your screen.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So if you come back to the zoom window, where you can see my face.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Okay, 1, s.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Okay.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Okay. So on the zoom window all the way at the bottom there's a couple of different icons we're just gonna look for the one in the middle.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000
That's green, and it says, Share, screen.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Let me know if you're finding that one.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Okay.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Okay. 1 s. What did I do?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
So. Are you still able to see me, or do you think you're somewhere else now?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Well, I was somewhere else, but I'm getting ready to.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Oh, good! Hold on 1 s!

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Okay, just let me know if you need a hand.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Okay.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Okay, perfect.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Okay, I can see you, and the chat window is still open and at the bottom see mutes that participants share screen so click on that.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Okay.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Yeah, perfect click on that. And then it's gonna open another window with a couple of different options. So you're just gonna look for the screen that you just opened that link, you just opened.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Are you seeing that option?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I see a whiteboard iphone pad.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Low model model, and then I see a lot of my creative writing work.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Okay. Well, I wish we could talk about your creative writing work instead.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Let me see!

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
But I think we'll have to talk about the Va.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It should that says show all windows. So I'm gonna go down to see if I can see.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Hmm!

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Yeah, so.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Okay.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
It's not showing the window that you sent me. I don't know why.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
That's okay. So the other option is, you can choose the first option.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.000
It might say something like desktop. It should be the first one when you opened up that new window.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Are you seeing that one?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000
No, I see the screen where you are, and then, next to that, it shows at the top.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Whiteboard.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Uhhuh.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It shows basic advanced in files. And then it just shows whiteboard iphone.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Okay.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Maybe it's this one that's I don't know.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
That sounds right. Let's try and click. Yeah, let's try that one.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
It just says, flow number one. That's it. Okay, okay.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
It's always a little tricky at the beginning. Yeah, that's perfect.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Okay. But this is asking for Ds logon. I don't have one.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Yeah, so, we're in a little bit of a funny place.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:44.000
For some reason. So why don't we? If you can just click on your keyboard if you click the back button to that left arrow key.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000
No!

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Did that do anything? Nope, what about the back button on the browser?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So on this web page that you're looking at over here, where there's a little arrow let's try and click that.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Okay. Now, okay.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Yeah, okay. And so we'll click back one more time.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Okay, click back one more time. That's fine. Okay.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Yes, Paul. Alright, that's perfect. So we're gonna stay here for a second.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Okay.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Okay.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Alright. Thank you for working through that with me. So now we're looking@theva.gov home, page, and what I'd like you to do for kind of the rest of our conversation is we're gonna imagine that you've come online because you needed to update your

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
address okay? So you're on the Va administration website, you need to update your address.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So the first thing that you need to do is sign in, so can you show me where you would find the sign in option on this page?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It's on the top right hand, right works in blue sign in.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Perfect. Yeah, let's click on that.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Oh, hold on! I gotta run and get my cable before my battery.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Dies. Hold on, please!

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Okay. Okay.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Always moving my computer from my art room to all over the house.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Anyway. Okay, so you I'm gonna click sign in.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Okay. And then I would.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Oh, nice! Sorry! I just realized I was on mute. But that's perfect.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:27.000
If if we just stay on this page for a second before we click anything, it sounds like normally you would click my healthy bet on this page right?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Correct.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Okay. And these other options are any of the other ones looking familiar to you?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I mean, I recognize all of them, but I'm not able to access any of them.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Okay, so you recognize them because you've seen them, probably on a page like this before.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Okay. No.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
But you don't have access to any of them. And you mentioned that you've tried to use id dot me, but it's not worked for you.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
No!

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Yeah, and we'll talk a little bit more about that.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
In a second. But what about these other 2? login.gov.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And Ds log on. Have you ever tried those ones?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I've tried Ds log on, but I don't have a d yet.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I don't have a Ds log on so.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I don't know how to access it.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Gotcha. Okay, that's okay. And so whenever you're coming online, you're always choosing my healthy bet.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And it seems to work well for you most of the time.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Yeah. It's the easiest one.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Okay, so I'm gonna throw a little bit of a curve ball at you right now.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And what we're gonna do today is we're gonna pretend like we're signing in with Ds log on.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
So I know you're not using Ds logon.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
We'll talk a little bit more in a second about why, that's why that's what I'm asking you to do.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000
But for now let's just click Ds log on so you can go ahead and click on that button.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Perfect. And then we're not gonna enter any information throughout our conversation today.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So you're just gonna click login here and we're gonna pretend like you put in your username.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
And you put in your password, and then you click login.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
So whenever you're ready you're welcome to click that button.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000
I'm sorry.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
That's okay.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I had it on mute.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.000
It's probably a marketer, anyway.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Okay, I'm just waiting for them to hang up so so I can put it on mute.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Okay. No worries.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
It's important. I always say they'll leave a message if me okay.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Perfect. So we know you don't have a Ds log on account right now.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
But we're gonna pretend like you put in your username and password.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And we're gonna click login. So you can click on that grade button.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000
There on your screen. Perfect. Okay. So now we're on this page.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And what are we seeing on this page? Right now? You describe that to me.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:22.000
It's just showing you how to create a login.gov account you know the Ds login will stop working for via digital tool soon, and it has a little paragraph there and then at the bottom it says note this account will only work for va digital tools.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000
And the features you may need to verify your identity.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Again to use login.gov on other government websites.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Create your login and continue with the Ds Login, for now.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Okay. Gotcha. So we're gonna talk a little bit more about what we're reading here.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:52.000
But just to start, we've imagined that you've signed into the Va administration website because you needed to change your address and then you're seeing this.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000
So. What do you think you would do if you saw something like this when you were trying to change your address?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Well, I would first have to create a login dot a login.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
To access the website to as a starting point.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Okay. So first off, you'd think if I wanna continue and access the website, I need to set up this account.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
That's sounds logical to me.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Yeah, that sounds logical to me. And then you read through some of the things you were noticing here.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
You said this was about creating a Login Gov. Account.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Why is it recommending that you create a login.gov account?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Well, in order to access any information, you're gonna have to be able to create a login in order to advance forward to.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:58.000
To enter or enter the information that you need to make changes, or any other information without that you're not gonna be able to continue forward cause, even though it's so, continue with Ds Login.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Now, if you don't have a login account, you're not gonna be able to move forward.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Gotcha. Okay? So you need to have a login Gov account in order to move forward and access the website.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
So that's why it's telling you to create an account that makes sense.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:26.000
And what about here? It says you can create a Va only login Gov account without needing to verify your identity.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Again. What is that talking about?

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:46.000
To me once again. It's stating that you have a premium Dslog Login account.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And then it's saying you can create a Va login.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Gov. Account with, without needing to verify your identity.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Okay.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:10.000
But even though it's saying, if there's a if they're talking about a premium Ds log account, it's really not gonna make any difference.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Right? Okay.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:20.000
If you don't have access to Ds login website, I mean, I know I have a premium account under my healthy that. But I'm sure that's different than a premium ds log on logon account.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Those are 2 separate entities.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:29.000
Right? Yeah, yeah, okay, and so is, is it a little bit odd that they're mentioning that you have a premium?

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Ds logon account, if they're also telling you that you can't use it anymore.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Is that what's confusing?

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
What's good? Well!

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Logically, I'm not understanding, because you would have to have a premium.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Ds. Login account.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
In order to do anything to me.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:08.000
And if you don't have that, it doesn't really matter if there's saying, if you.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000
You can create a Va log of accounts without needing to identify without needing to verify your identity.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Again. But if they don't have any information about me in the Ds Login system, all of this is just a mute point.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Gotcha. Okay? Because you're somebody who has premium.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Mhb. Or sorry, my healthy, that then they don't have. They?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
This is kind of irrelevant. Is that what you mean?

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
If that makes logical sense to me.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Yeah, that makes sense that makes logical sense to me as well what we'll do is we'll imagine that this is saying because you have a premium.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000
My healthy. That login account. You can create a Va only login.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Gov. Account. Does that change? How you might interpret what it's saying to you?

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Once again!

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000
If it's saying that I no, no, no!

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Okay.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Because yet still you would have to have a premium.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Ds log account first, that would be the first part of it, and because you do have a premium Ds login account, then I would be able to go in and create a Va.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Only login account, but that's only if I'm already a premium.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Yeah, you have to.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Ds login user. So no, to me it's the same.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Gotcha? Yeah, yeah, I definitely get that. Okay, I get that.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:04.000
If it was saying, you know, let's pretend the screen looked different, and it said, Because you have a premium, my healthy bed account.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
You can create a Va only login.gov account.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
What is that? Yeah.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Well, that makes sense that makes sense to me. It would be easy, because I'm already a premium, healthy.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000
That user and so then the next step would be to just create my Va.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Only login gov account, and I wouldn't have to.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
I wouldn't need to be verified each.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Gotcha. Okay? Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And thank you for working with me.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Cause. I know you don't use Ds log on, and I know this, says Ds log on. So it makes it kind of confusing.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:38.000
But that's really helpful. Everything you said so far.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
What about verifying your identity? Can you tell me what that means?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
What is verifying your identity?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Well, to me it would mean that they would want to see your name.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000
They probably want you to verify your date of birth, and maybe the last score of your social.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Okay? And is that something that you would do one time?

00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Is that something you would do every time, or sometimes.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Well, I would think, if there, if you're setting up for the Va.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Only login that you'd only have to do it one time.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Okay, gotcha. Okay? And then why is it saying, Va, only login, what does that mean?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
I would assume that it's only for veterans.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
To use.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Okay, so it's a login. Yeah, it's a login account.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:31.000
That is specifically for veterans to set up and to use with the Va.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
All this automation.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Yeah, okay, yeah, it's this is all a little bit of a mind.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:44.000
A brain twister, or whatever. So thank you for working through the questions with me.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:51.000
At the bottom of this it says, note, this account will only work for Va digital tools.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:26:01.000
What are va, digital tools?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Well!

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:21.000
I could only assume that it would be something that would be with in a dropdown box, but without having.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Hi!

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
I don't know. You kind of stuck me there because I'm not really clear as what they mean by digital tools.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Yeah, that's that's a fair answer. That's really helpful.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Alrighty, and then the last sentence I'm gonna ask you about on this page.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
It says in the future you may need to verify your identity again, to use login.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Gov. On other government websites.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Well, that's make sense, because I do he used fema ever since Hurricane in.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:27:00.000
So that makes perfectly logical sense to me, because it's a different.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000
It's a totally different entity. It's not the acceleration. It's another government system.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Okay. So it's telling you that you could use this login with another government system.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
That's what it's saying.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Okay, and what would you need to do if you wanted to use this login with another government system?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000
So not with the Vs.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000
If I understand you correctly, I would have to log in to that other site.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
I mean, I know with Fema I do have a different username and password.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Then I do then what I use on my healthy bit.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful. So if you wanted to use your login that you're setting up right now with Fema, you would just need to log in on the Fema website with that username.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
That's correct.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Okay, that's really helpful. So what we're gonna do is we're gonna pretend like we're creating a login Gov account.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Now. So what would you do if you were gonna create the Login Gov account?

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
You can show me on your screen.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
I would click on create login.gov account.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Okay, perfect. And then what are we looking at here?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000
And then it's asked. It's asking you to answer your email address and your password.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
And then sign in.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Okay.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Is this something that you'd be able to sign into?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
You know, we're not gonna make you put in any information.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.000
But this is something that you think you have an account for.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Not if it's under login.gov.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Okay. And so would what would you do on this page?

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
If that's the case.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Then I would click on, create an account.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Okay, great. And for the next couple of screens, if you can do the same thing, just tell me all loud what you would be doing when you're looking at this page, and then we can keep clicking through.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Okay. So it's asking for you to create your account so I would enter my email address then it's asking you to select your email language preference.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:19.000
I would put. It's already highlighted as English, and then I would put a check mark or X where it's asking me to read and accept the login.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Government rules or use. Then I would press, continue.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Perfect, let's go ahead and do that. You can click.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000
I read and accept, and then we'll click, continue.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Okay, now is telling me they sent an email to my address with the link because they're wanting to confirm.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
It's my email address, and then follow the link, too.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Continue creating your account. If I want you me to check my email, once I check my email, if I check it.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.000
And I don't see any information. Then I would say I didn't receive an email to Resend.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
I'd have to wait for them to resend it, and for some reason there's a problem with my email address.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:14.000
They're asking me by have a different email address to use.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Gotcha. Okay. That's really helpful. Is this something you've done before?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Is this, for to you this process.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Yes, I've had to do it before. I know it's all for security.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Okay, right? So.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Reasons, but I'm like, Oh, my God! Why do I have to do this?

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Again. But anyway, I know it's for my own security.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Okay, great. So it's a little bit of a nuisance.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
But you kind of understand why you have to do it. That's helpful.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Correct.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000
So let's click, check email and we're not gonna obviously go check your email. Now.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000
But we're gonna pretend like you got sent this email. Now.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
But we're going to pretend like you got sent this email.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
It says, confirm your email and let me know what you're seeing here. And same thing.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
You were doing before.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:08.000
It says, thank you for submitting your email address. Please click the link below or copy and paste the entire link into your browser, telling you that if you don't do it within 24 h it will expire.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Then you click on confirm email address.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Perfect. Let's go ahead and do that.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:28.000
So now a once you 2 create a strong password, and it must be 12 characters long and not be commonly used.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Password, and this can be tricky at times, because I have, like a systematic system that I use, and normally it would be like 3 a capital letter, 2 characters, then a couple of numbers, then add sign, and then it would be a couple of more letters.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Okay.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Numbers, and then a pound sign, then a slash, then asterisk, and then a one, and even with doing that, and they show you the password.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
When you click, continue, for whatever reason it'll say doesn't accept.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Sometimes it'll say there's no capital letter. Okay, that's a easy fix.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:16.000
So after you've corrected and put the capital letter and you hit, continue.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:27.000
It's still giving you air. So then you have to say, Okay, maybe it doesn't like the add sign or the pound sign, or the asterisk, or the slash.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000
So you're going back and forth trying to figure out what is wrong with the past that you've selected.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:46.000
And normally, sometimes I can get it the first time, sometime it takes 2 or 3, and then it's gonna tell me if the password is strong enough or is weak, or it's acceptable.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Okay, gotcha, that's really helpful.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:55.000
So you definitely have a system and you kind of know what to expect even while you're like troubleshooting with like an error message or anything like that.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:01.000
You kind of have experience with working through that. That's that's really helpful.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
So on this page. It's it sounds like you'd kind of know where you would start.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:13.000
And then if it came back, saying, You know you didn't put up a capital letter, you would go and fix that that's really helpful, so we won't have you create a password for real today.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:20.000
So you can click, continue, I mean, we're just gonna keep going through these this setup.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
So let me know what you're seeing on this page.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:54.000
It's asking me for authentication methods setup to add more security to the authentication options below and they're asking, do you want face our touch, unlock a security key government employee id which that's not applicable to me authentication application not sure

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:04.000
about that one, and then text or voice message are the options.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Okay, great. So that was really helpful already, just going through the list. Which option do you think that you would choose?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Personally, I don't use Facebook, Twitter, Instagram.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:31.000
None of that stuff, because I don't want my face flattered all over the place.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Yeah.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:39.000
I'm just not comfortable. So that wouldn't be something that I would use the security key I've heard about.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:46.000
And for me that might be the best option, and then either text or voice, message.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Okay. Gotcha, that's really helpful.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
So why don't you go ahead and click whichever option you want to set up?

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
And then I think you'll just need to scroll down after you.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Click, yeah, perfect. So if you scroll down on a little bit, I think we might have a button at the bottom of the page.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Not letting me scroll down. Hmm!

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
Hmm! Sometimes it's a bit funny. It gets a bit slow.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
You can try and click the down key on your keyboard.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000
Yeah, I did. But oh, here we go. Okay. But now.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Okay. Alright. Let's try. Okay? Well, this one, let's go back.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
But now I don't know. I had it.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
I had it on face or touch, for whatever reason, I don't know.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
I can go back, I guess. Let me see. Okay. So.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Yeah. Let's go back. And if Security key is not working, that might just be a problem with the prototype.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:49.000
We'll try it one more time. Try and scroll down. Maybe.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Is that not working?

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Not working. Okay, that's okay. Well, then, why don't we click text message?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
Because that seem like that might be an option you choose right?

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:07.000
If you couldn't get security key to work. Okay? And then we'll I think we'll need to click the arrow on your keyboard.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Oh, there we go! There's a little arrow pop up!

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Every time I hit the every time I hit the the page down key.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Let me check it. It keeps going back, no matter what I press.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Yeah.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
If it keeps going back to face or touch, unlock. I don't know what.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Okay, yeah, it looks like, it's yeah. It's going a bit funny.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
I think if you move your mouse around, there's going to be a little bit of a black.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000
No. Okay. It doesn't want to play.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Oh, there we go. Okay.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Oh, wait! Wait. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait. Okay, now it's doing it.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Okay? And then under text or voicemail message, it has.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Oh no!

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
What in the world? What happened? Oh, gosh! Let me see what happened.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
We lost it.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Let me click!

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Hmm!

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
It looks like maybe it closed, which is okay. A little bit of a little bit of a bummer.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
But what I'll try and do is while you're still sharing your screen.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:14.000
I'm gonna send you the link again. So if you go back to Zoom window.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Oh, actually, and looks like, maybe on your screen, I can still see if you go to the last tab.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Okay.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:27.000
You know all those little tabs at the top. So those little boxes just above where your arrow is.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.000
So it's like, I can see, your email is opened and your zoom's opened.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:42.000
If you go all the way to the end, it says, flow number one.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Are you seeing what I mean? I can talk you through it.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000
I'm looking just 1 s.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Otherwise. So go up to the yeah. Okay.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:13.000
I saw it before.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Of this time. I don't see it.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Yeah, so, can you move your mouse around? I'm not sure where. Oh, there it is.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
I see it's on on the Nba right?

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Yeah, it was.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Okay, cool. So if you just move your mouse up, just go up a little bit further.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:49.000
So kind of like the top of the screen. So all the way up.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Doesn't look like the mouse is moving.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
It's at the top.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Oh, there it is, okay. And then we've got to move a little bit to the right.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:10.000
So we can find all those. Yeah, okay, perfect. So even a little higher, a little higher.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Yeah, a little bit higher.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Oh, I see. Oh, God, I'm blind. Okay, okay.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Perfect. There we go. We found it sorry about that alrighty.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000
So this is where we were. We were having trouble with the scrolling, which I think is my fault with the the prototype.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:35.000
So sorry about that. But let's try and click security key.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
Why is that open?

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
I think you're on the page.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Hey! Hold on!

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Hmm! Why isn't it not opening?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.000
I think. Let me do this. Hold on. I think I see it alright.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Here we go, okay.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:08.000
There we go, I think. Perfect, alrighty. So let's let's try and click on security key.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Are you seeing security key? There? Yeah, perfect. And then hopefully, this time it lets us scroll down.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Let's see, are you able to kind of move the mouse down a little bit?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Nope, it's not working. Okay. See if that little black box at the bottom.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Alright! It's just disappeared.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Okay.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Hmm! There we go. Continue bys. Perfect. Sorry about that.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Okay.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Perfect. Alrighty. Okay, so we're back here. Thanks for working through that with me.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
So what is the screen showing you?

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:53.000
It's telling me, okay, to add a security key that meets whatever F.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Ido stands for, as your often authentication method.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:08.000
You can add as many security keys as you want. So get started first.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Give your security Key a nickname.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Okay, and.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:16.000
I would just say v e.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Okay, great. And what made you want to choose security key as an option?

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Well, there was another study, and they were explaining to me.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:56.000
You know how secure it is, and would I prefer a security key than other methods, and I thought about it because they said, You can use it, you know, on your your laptop, and you could set it up where you would just put it into the port on your computer and you know keep it there or

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Gotcha!

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
carry it with you, and I believe they said if even if I carried it with me, if I were to go to the library or someone else, I or somewhere else, I would be able to use it, because that's my own personal security, key, so I like that, I like that, Option.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Okay? And have you tried that before since you heard about it?

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Okay.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:24.000
No, I haven't, because I thought they said they were still doing the study, and I guess it was still in the preemptive stages, cause I thought they were.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Gonna send me a key. So I can actually try it. But when I got home I have all these gadgets in my my art room.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:44.000
I'm always trying to figure out. What is this for?

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Okay.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
What is this for? So I actually may have one, I think, in my art studio, but I've never done anything with it.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Okay. Gotcha.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:43:03.000
I, I need direction, because automation for me can be a little bit scary at times, and I only go to websites that I actually use. I'm not.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:10.000
I guess I'm not normal because everybody goes into base time, and Facebook and Twitter and all that stuff.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
I'm not comfortable using all of those specific entities.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
This is not for me.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Yeah, yeah, that makes a lot of sense. So if you were gonna use something like that, you do seem to have some interest.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Do you think you might even have a security key? But you would need someone to help walk you through exactly what the like setup process looks like that makes sense.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Right cause. Like, I think I do have one. Yeah.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Okay, well, let's click on. Continue, we're not gonna actually set up the security key today.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
But that's been really helpful to chat through.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:52.000
If you were using your security key, then you might enter in this code and then we're just gonna click, submit we're just gonna move on so we can get your feedback on a couple more things.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.000
So what does this screen telling you?

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:04.000
That they've added my authentication method. Now they want me to add a second method as a backup.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Okay, what do you think you would do on this screen?

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Hello! If I was actually going to do this I probably would have sold.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Voice or text, and have the authentication. I would have the security key as the backup.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
I would have reversed it.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Okay. Gotcha. Okay. Gotcha. That's helpful.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Yes.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
So you would probably want to have the backup, and you'd want security key to be your backup, and you would probably usually use the text message.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Bye, that's correct.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000
That's really helpful. Alright. Well, today, we're gonna skip setting up a backup method.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Okay.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
So let's click, skip for now and then we're gonna continue to the next screen.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:58.000
So what is the screen telling us?

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
It's basically telling me that they've set up my account.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
They have my email. And I have been linked to the Va system.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:14.000
But it's only 4 information regarding Va. As it pertains to my account.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Okay, great. So you've set up the account. It's only for the Va.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
And that's why it's telling you they're going to share the information with the Va.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Correct.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Okay. What do you expect to see when you click?

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Agree and continue.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
That!

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
I'm not sure. Hi! Kiss! I'll find out when I.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Okay, that's fair. Let's go ahead and do that. We'll click a green, continue, and we'll see what comes up alright.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Okay, so it's telling me that I've signed in with login.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Dot gov, that's again, and that I can use the login.gov for all my va digital tools.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:24.000
And then I currently have a Va login.gov account, and if I wanna use my account on other government websites I'll need to go back to login.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Got that go to verify my identity.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000
H okay.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Okay, so is anything you're reading here, surprising to you or something you haven't learned already.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:47.000
No, not really!

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Okay. And so why is it telling you that you've signed in with login?

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Gov.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Because all of those steps previously got me to this point.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:13.000
That makes sense. And there's a link here that says, Learn more about verifying your identity with login and this might feel a little repetitive.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:21.000
But can you tell me what you think that link is about?

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Well to me what would mean? It would give you a breakdown of all the different ways that you can verify your identity, and just go into more depth about each one.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Okay? And what's like an example of one of the ways that you might verify your identity.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Voice, for text.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Okay. And so earlier on, when we chose those like voice or text message.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Or we talked about security keys are those ways of verifying your identity?

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Okay, that makes sense. That's been really helpful.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
And we're kind of getting to the end of the session.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:06.000
So one thing I'm curious about is when we started this, we said, you know, you were coming to the Va website because you needed to change your address.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
But when you tried to go in, it said, you need to set up a login. Gov.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Account right? So we went and set up that account, and then.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:27.000
Now we've finished. And so, if right now you wanted to go and I change your address, what would you do on this screen?

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Well, if I close this screen out, what's underneath that it says, my Va.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Got to your profile, and oh, I can't move it right right right.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Yeah, it won't move. That's actually perfect. I just wanted to confirm that it was easy enough to close the popup.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000
That's perfect. That's okay. Let's let's stay here for a second.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Oh, oh, gosh! I'm sorry!

00:48:51.000 --> 00:49:02.000
That's perfect. So it was. It was easy to close the pop up, and you would have probably went and searched around the website and been able to change your address.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Okay.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
So that's help. We're gonna do one more thing before we finish. Okay.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Okay.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000
So we were just pretending we'd signed in right.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
And then let's pretend like we signed out.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:20.000
So we finished that session. And now we're a couple of weeks have passed, and you wanted to come back into your account because you needed to change something let's say you needed to.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
You know. Update your mailing address.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:31.000
You just changed again. And so let's say that you were gonna sign in what?

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:36.000
How are we gonna sign in now?

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Well, since we went through that process, I should be able to either use my healthy vet or login.gov.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Okay, and how are you? Gonna decide?

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Which one of those to use.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Hi, I would probably revert back to my healthy that because I'm the most familiar with that one.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Okay, that makes sense.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:13.000
And I, and then and then, when I had in my spare time, I would try to go in on login.gov, just to become familiar.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:25.000
But I have to be familiar with the site in order to use it over and over again. And right now that's my healthy vet, because I know how to maneuver around to get to the information and make changes that I need to change.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Okay, yeah, so you know how to get to things like messaging your doctor, or whatever else you need to do in my healthy bats.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000
So you feel more familiar with that. Okay, that makes a lot of sense.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000
And why did we set up login.gov?

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:50.000
In the first place, if you can remember, back to that first part of the call.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:51:07.000
I think it has something to do with security, and also not having to be too repetitive in logging in, because you're already verified because you have that premium account.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful. So what we're gonna do now is we're gonna pretend like we're signing in with login.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Gov. So we're just gonna click login.gov.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
And then we're just gonna click sign in. We're gonna pretend like we put in our email address and password.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:53.000
And we're going to click sign in perfect. And then we're, I'm gonna give you a second to read this screen. Okay?

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Okay.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Alrighty. So what is this telling you?

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Yeah, I was talking about being able to access Va and using the login.gov for outside.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Outside of the Va Fema Calsa security. Whatever other Government agencies that you need assistance with.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Yeah, okay, perfect. So we talked a little bit about that earlier.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Right, so how you might use your login account with things like Fema. And if you wanted to use your login.gov account with Fema, what would you do next?

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Well, I would have to be into the Fema website, and of course they're still gonna need to identify me.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:04.000
You know, with the basic information. And then, after they verified that information, and they should just take me right into the famous site, or I can take care and make changes.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Send a message. Whatever I wanna do.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Gotcha alright. So we'll go to Fema, the website.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:19.000
And it's gonna tell you, okay, you need to verify your identity now with Fema, and then you can go on and use this login.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:33.000
There. And when you're doing that, is that what is that going to be similar to what we did today when we set it up with the Va.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Hmm!

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:44.000
No, I don't think so, because they already have most of my information already in the system.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:50.000
I would think I would do this more. So when it's outside of the Va.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Okay, got it. So the Va. Already has some of your a lot of your information in the system and so you'd have to do it. You'd have to.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Maybe add.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Yeah. The only only time that I've had to do that.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:17.000
If, for whatever reason, I had a brain freeze, and I couldn't remember my password, it would ask me to for either my username, and then it would ask me the last 4 of my social or my complete social my date.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:25.000
Of birth phone number information like that. And then it would send me a link to change my password.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.000
After I happen to verify.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Gotcha. Okay, that's really helpful. So that's kind of what you're expecting to do when you try and use this with Fema.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Hmm!

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
And if you said no thanks, I don't want to verify.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:42.000
Do you think anything would happen?

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Well, I could think of the possible possible solutions in my ask me another question.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Why I didn't want to, or it would just say, Okay, thank you.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Okay. And and you could kinda continue on using this account with the Va.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Okay, that's helpful. Well, I see we're nearly finished here.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000
So if you want to stop sharing your screen, you are welcome to.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Okay.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:22.000
I think somewhere on the top of your screen, if you move your mouse up there, it might say, stop sharing but I'm not gonna be able to see it.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Okay. I'm back.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:30.000
So there you go easy. Well, we talked about a lot of things today, and I asked you a lot of questions.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:37.000
So that was really helpful for me, I think. Was there anything that stuck out out to you?

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000
If there was any last thing you wanted to comment on before we wrapped up.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Yeah, when when these surveys come up and you, you know, interview and talk with the veteran, how is this information being used to better serve us?

00:55:53.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Yeah, that's a great question. So what? We're looking at right now is how we we can.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:08.000
Get veterans to adopt a different type of login method and we don't really know exactly what that process is going to look like.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.000
But we do know it's going to be a little complicated for veterans, and we want to figure out how we can make it easier.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:18.000
So some of the things we talked about today. I'm asking you questions to understand.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Like, where things that we've written are not clear enough.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:25.000
And so then it's making it harder on you, and we'll see your feedback as well as other veterans.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:31.000
So we'll, you know, this week we've we've spoken to 10 veterans.

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:35.000
We have a really similar conversation, and we'll take all the feedback.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000
And we'll say, Okay, this is what we're noticing on this page.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:42.000
This button needs to be here we're not able to find this button needs to be here. We're not able to find this, and we'll start to change things and then we'll do this again.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:46.000
So we'll talk to veterans again, and we'll see if it's working better.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:56.000
So it's it helps us make like little changes over time before we make a ton of veterans see something or use something that doesn't really work that well for them.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Does that make sense?

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Yeah, because I know that security is a really big issue. And even though there are a lot of different information in the dropdown box, even, still, you still have to call the A.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Yeah.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Or they have to send you a document because you can't do it online and I'm like, Well, well, why do you have part of the information online?

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:28.000
But you don't have the rest of the information online, and then you still have to call, or you still have to submit a paper form.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000
And then once you get the paper form and send it back to them.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Then they input the information, and then they still send you paper verifying that they have made the changes.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:48.000
I don't know why it can't be simplified where you can just do everything online, whether it's your banking information, your address, whatever it is.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.000
So they're not multiple multiple steps, because that can get frustrating.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:58.000
After a while. You're just like, Okay, take a deep breath.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Let me try this again.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Totally. Yeah, totally. No. I definitely understand that. I mean the Va.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Like any government kind of service is complex. There's a lot of different people working on a lot of different things.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000
So I think as like over time, things will become more streamlined.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Let's say, and some of the services that are online that people want to be able to do in person.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Maybe that will become easier and similarly, like, there's some things that we're doing, you know, in paper that we could actually be doing online. And it would make things easier.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:36.000
So I think that's a fresh frustrating experience right now, when there's not a change to be made.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:39.000
But I do think that there's a lot of folks at the Va.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Who are thinking about these things right now. I don't know which individuals would be the ones to help with this, but hopefully, there's some reassurance that there's a lot of us doing things like this to try and make small changes and yeah that's kind of what we're we're here.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
To do, and why we need to have conversations with folks like yourself.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Because it's really really valuable to have your feedback to.

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Okay, well, you're welcome.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Well, thanks so much. It's it's been a pleasure we've taken up the whole hour.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
So I'm gonna let you go. So I don't take too much of your time.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000
But I do. Wanna let you know that Perjian, the people who sent up this interview.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:20.000
They're gonna be the ones that manage paying you for your time.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:28.000
And so, if you have any questions about that, you let them know, and I think that's everything to do. You have any other questions for me?

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:29.000
No, that's it. I'm just looking for better choice.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Okay. Okay.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Yeah.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Yeah.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Down the road, more simplistic because I, for one, like things that are easy, because when it comes to automation, if I spend a whole hour trying to do the same process when that hour is done, I am done, and then I'm on the phone you know, calling and as you know, then you could be on hold for the

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:04.000
3 min, 30 min, 45 min, and then, when you think you have the right person they're like, what we have to transfer, you.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:14.000
And I'm just sitting there, and if I could see myself as I'm waiting on the phone, it would probably be a really comical event.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Yeah, yeah, no. I hear you. I definitely hear you.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And I think we're all hopeful.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Well, I know that Va. Is constantly making sure changes to make it better for veterans, and I do appreciate that.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Well, we appreciate your time a lot today. So I'm gonna let you go.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
I hope you have a good rest of your day, or your day, or your evening, and thanks so much for chatting today.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Bye.
