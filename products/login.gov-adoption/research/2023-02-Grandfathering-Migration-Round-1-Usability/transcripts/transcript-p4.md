### Transcript

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I started recording, I'd like to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Yes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'd like to start by learning more a little bit about your experience with the Va.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And some of our online services. How long have you been a veteran?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Since 1990.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Okay. And how often do you go online to access and manage your Va benefits and healthcare?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
At least once a month, but sometimes 3 to 4 times a week.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Okay. When what makes that change that you visit more frequently?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So there is a couple of reasons why I would visit more frequently.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:05.000
One would be because I have a you know, a medical concern that comes up and I'm trying to figure out which position to go to our trying to get a consultant to see a physician I schedule an appointment.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Another might be, because I have outside doctors who, because of continuum care, it's changed.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The name has changed so I don't know what it is, but it's outside the Va.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Of course.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And so there's are. They may have something else that they need me to do, and I need to coordinate that back with my doctor, or whoever seeing for that particular.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And then, yeah.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Yeah, yeah. So it sounds like, oh, sorry. It sounds like, you're managing a lot of a lot of your healthcare online a lot.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Yeah, so, yeah, the blood work. So all the you know.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Prescriptions? Description. Yeah, trying to get them refilled.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So all of those things I pretty much prefer to do things online versus physically.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Go into Va. R to call. I'm always have preferred that, and I've pushed to, you know, to use that as a you know.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Great. Well, do you remember the last time that you signed in?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Maybe last week.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Okay. And do you remember why you were signing in that?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I'm I don't remember. No, not right off of my head. Yeah.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
That's okay. But probably one of those healthcare tasks like refilling a prescription.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Maybe.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I think it was to reach out to my doctor. Well, so it might have been because I had a Va.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Appointment and it was virtual. But I don't remember if that was it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm not so.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000
That's okay. Yeah. How do you sign into the Va.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Hmm! Tell me more about that.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So sometimes, that's a problem. So there's like it changed.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Obviously, that's a a new thing. And it went to like, there's 4 different ways.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
You can do, you can do my bit, or you know, id me, or some like.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Yeah.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So there's 4 different things to use which.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Which one is, that?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Like I have started to use the one that's that lips me into the system versus it's the id me!

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Okay.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So it's and which it's connected to my Google, which has been authenticated.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Do multiple processes, and probably the most up to date. The others.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Yeah, tell me about those other ones.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Work, sometimes they'll that we in yeah, they'll let me into like to sign in.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But then there's like some other like other steps. There's multiple other pieces that have to be done once it gets to a certain point, it only allows me in to only certain things, and I don't remember what that.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:20.000
But I use secure chat a lot. So I have to have something that's gonna let me look at my records look at my pharmacy stuff and then still be able to write to my doctor in a secure chat.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I don't wanna have to like log into something.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Do one thing and then log out of it and log into something else, and then I can do something else.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I wanna be able to do all of those things at one time.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Yeah, you wanna be able to do everything in one place. It sounds like the different logins.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Are your user? Different Va services?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Yeah, I guess that's it. I mean, I guess if I pulled it up I would be able to tell you better.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
But just from memory, that's what I'm remembering, is it?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Like. I know the the one that like id me it's set up with Google.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
It's authenticated through Google and so I click one button it does whatever it's doing in the background.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And then once opens, I'm in, I can pretty much do everything.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So that yeah, id me is the one that's working the best for you lately.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I think so, and I think I can't remember the other one that needs my.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000
There's another one that I use to look at my benefits.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I feel like that's the one.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Is that on benefits? Yeah, and so any benefits you use a different okay, do you know that one might be your Ds log on?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Yeah.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Is that when okay? Okay? Well, we're gonna be talking about those today.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Yeah, so I'd like to share some ideas with you so we can get your feedback.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Okay.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Oh, well! Is there anything else that you want to share with me about signing on?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
You gave us a lot of information.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
No, that's it.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
In a minute. I'm gonna send you a link to the prototype.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
As I mentioned earlier, the prototype is like a pretend version of the Va. Website.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So it's going to look similar. But it won't work as you might. So I'm gonna send this to you in the chat.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And let me know when you open that.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
In your browser.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Hey? Are you familiar with sharing your screen?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Oh, sure! Yup!

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Yeah, but I'm getting. That's why I was gonna take me a minute because I had old one. I was just kind of closing.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Of course, take your time.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So, okay.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Yup, I'm right here.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Sure!

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Hello. Okay. Okay, that's something else in the background. I was just I didn't see.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I'm trying to look for you to. Oh, there's the zoom!

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Okay, here we go. The zoom in the chat. I was trying to set the board up so that my screen up.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Okay, yeah, take your screen. Okay?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Oh, perfect! Okay. Yup, yes, let me know when you have that open.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Perfect.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So now that now that we're looking at this page, I'm like to start by imagining that you've come to, you've come online to Va. Gov. To.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Let's say, send a chat to your doctor, and first you need to sign in. Can you tell me what you would do first?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Okay, let's go ahead and do that.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And before we click anything, can you tell me what you would do next if you were signing in?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I'd click this button here. The!

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
So, now that I'm looking at it, I'm not sure if I use id me, or low.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Doug go, 'cause both of these work for me, but I do the.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Okay, that's bring me to something else.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Yeah, you can go back. And in your browser. Yup!

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Okay. So I d me should be the one that comes up with my Google.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000
But it may not work in this.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Okay.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Okay, okay? Well, today, we're gonna imagine that you're signing in with that Ds log on credential that you mentioned that you sometimes use. So let's click sign in and we'll click continue and let's pretend that you entered in your username and password and you can click login.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Okay. Look, okay.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And before we read this in detail, can you describe to me what you're looking?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
It says, create a login.gov account.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So do I need to go back one.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Oh, because if we create one!

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Why do you think disappeared, or white?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So is telling me that it's gonna stop working for digital tools and so it's like saying that I have to like Va.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Only login goes account without any need. Well!

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Via digital tools. I don't know right? It just said it just said it at the top so then I was like, Okay, I need to create that because what I've come to realize with these systems, like, like, if if you keep going like ignoring it.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And ignoring it. Then, at some point you can't get into none of this.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Any of the systems, and so.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
This is something that you've run into before.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Yes, actually I did. I kept ignoring. I was like, oh, I'll do it another time.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Okay.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I'll do it another time. And then that's when when I guess you reformatting it because the buttons and so you could choose which one.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:24.000
You could choose which one you wanted to do before. But it wasn't.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
You mean that sign in page that you could choose which one? Okay?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
They weren't stacked like that. They were. I guess you if they were up at the top it seemed like, a Yeah, yeah.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So when you click into the thing, it would be like my healthy bed or blue button was down here.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Okay.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
There was like. There were all of the button. Things were in different, so you could choose it so.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And when that was coming up you were ignoring that.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Well when initially, when it said, We're this is going away.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Okay.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
You need to create some other stuff. And for the system, or whatever.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And I was like, Yeah, okay, I don't need that right now.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I just need to go in and get my stuff. I don't have time, and then I had a unique situation.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Happen where I was in the system, declared deceased.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So I'm not. I can't. I don't know why that happened.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I just know it happened and so I've been trying like making sure that all of my stuff is up to date now, cause I don't. Are.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
If it was like just a second which are what? But that's been.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:38.000
The oh, crap! That's been the issue. So let me see, what did I do now?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It's okay. I think.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I click my screen. My my keyboard is like touch, and is real sensitive. So.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Okay.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Oh, sure! If you just, I think that you just went back one page so if you just go forward and click that Yup perfect, then we're back where we were looking at that model.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So let's imagine that you're in that scenario where we're you've come to a lot to to via do go to message your doctor, and after you've signed in with your Ds Logon credential.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:21.000
You've come to. What would you do next?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Probably be best for me to read it all the way to the end.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:40.000
That would probably be the best thing to do.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:47.000
After you finish reading it. Can you summarize what you've read to me?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Okay. So it's this particular log on is gonna stop working for the Va digital tools.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And so it's I. I can create a login.gov, it's gonna only work for the Va digital tools.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And then, if I use it on other government sites, I'm gonna have to like Re to verify my identity again.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Okay, do you have any?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
So again each time I use it I have to verify my identity.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
That's what I'm getting from.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Okay? So you're reading this. And every time that you that you have to use a login Gov account, you'll have to re verify your account.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
To sign in, yeah, you'd have to.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I don't know yet, but I would presume that to sign in once.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000
It's already been once I've set up the account.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Then the the like. Verifying that it's work that that I am, who I am is gonna happen every time.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So like with anything a password. And my email address and as long as those things are right, then I can go on.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:26.000
But that's like as I'm sure, while I'm in the system now, it'll work.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Okay.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Once I create it. But it's like if I log out and log back in feel like that's that to do.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Do it over again.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So what does verifying your account mean to you?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Verifying my account, are authenticating. It is usually verifying my identity that I am the rightful user of that.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And then I have the appropriate.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I didn't. Identity based information to get access to that account.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Do you have any initial questions after you've read this modal?

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I guess it was the one thing that threw me off was va digital tools.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Sure!

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I just didn't I didn't have a a previous association with that name, and so that probably was the only thing that made me kind of like hesitant about the information I know creating a Va.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Only login makes sense because you don't want to have a login that you create, that works across multiple government systems.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Cause you wanna have your hipaa controlled content over here, separate from anything else, just in case happen.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
So you wanna have some type of safeguards to protect your data.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:16.000
In this scenario when you first saw this model, would you close it if you first saw it?

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
That's what I was saying. Yes, I would have closed it.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Yeah, yeah, it looked, I was, gonna say, it looks like when you first saw you initially went to close it.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Is, that.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:33.000
It's not of habit, I think. Yeah, it's absolutely out of habit.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Cause. I did read that first line. It says, soon, tool soon, and I was like, stop working soon.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Okay, so this is not something I need to work with. But having a date, maybe to say, the soon is July third.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:57.000
These systems have to be, you know, updated, or whatever like that gives like a heads up like, don't play with this. It's yeah.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:04.000
You can close it now, but you gotta do. You know it's you know there's a sense of urgency.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Yeah. So if you saw this today, you would not be interested in setting up a login account right now, correct.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Okay.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
No, no, because usually I'm coming online to do something very quickly.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
I gotta get into something to give to a doctor or something.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So I'm not typically having time to like do this. And I don't know what this would look like on my phone, which is probably how I would have access to anyway.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Okay. Can you tell me more about it that if you saw this?

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Yeah, I would close it cause that cause it's too cumbersome to.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Like the fields on the entry on a lot of those things are just not set up to, you know.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:16.000
If it's a number, you know it doesn't go to the number pad or the data padding is still like you have to use the number from this, and like some of the little boxes, are hard to determine.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Like what exactly needs to go there. It just doesn't.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
It doesn't always work. Well. It's not always user friendly.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
The user interface within the way that it. You know, a structure is, can be. I don't.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000
I problem, madam, might be a harsh word, but it's just like it's just.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
But play with it is like, Oh, I'll just do it later.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And so especially if I'm on the go, I'm on my mobile.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:19:06.000
I'm just trying to get a message or send something, and I don't even remember if if if I've had problems to send messages, I feel like there was something that happened once or twice, so try to do everything on my laptop.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Yeah. So if you saw this on your mobile, you would close it and wait to do it later on.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Yeah.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Your. Okay. Okay, do you have any hesitations about setting up a login account?

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Well!

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
So!

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:40.000
As in general consumer. Yes, I'm like, why, what's happening with the other information as a person who this is sort of a wagon wheel of mine.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:48.000
I you know I just like Oh, this is just a new system it's just what's happening.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
I wouldn't think it was fake, because I already have.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.000
You know. You know I'm always looking at the website before I get on.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:12.000
You know, like to check to see that it's not some phishing or some other thing I'm always like, okay, so pop-up came up like, Is this the real website?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Okay.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Is this something else? So I would have already paid attention to that, so that wouldn't be like on my mind if I was on the va.gov site, and that for me it would be just be time.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
It would just be like, How long is it? Is this?

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Gonna take me 15 min, 40 min, an hour and 20 min.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Am. I gonna have to have 5 different pieces of information? Am I?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Is it just gonna be my name in my, you know. Via is, it might be, you know, like I don't know enough.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000
About what is it's gonna take to actually accomplish this.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
And if it's it says a few minutes.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
I mean, I'm a disabled veteran.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
So a few minutes. For whom?

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Hmm, okay, yeah. Thanks for that. Why do you think the Va is recommending that you set up a login?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:16.000
More likely than not that there's a some safety protocols that have been incorporated into this.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:26.000
And so there, trying to get everybody on the same system or same thing and it's easier to do it this way than to back end.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Try to fix stuff that would just be my speculation, or that there's a completely new system that everyone's being integrated to.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
And I might have said the same exact thing, but I just in my thinking it's one thing to be a completely new system.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
It's not another thing to be a working on a certain platform.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
We're just getting a new way to access it.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
To me those are different kind of different things.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Okay. Yeah. Thanks. Okay, great today. Let's imagine that you're going to set up that login of account.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:28.000
So let's go ahead and click Yup.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Hmm!

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000
And as we go through the next couple of screens, I'd like for you to describe out loud what you would do next, and if you have a question or something interest you, let me, what would you do next year?

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
I would enter my!

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000
I'm sorry. Let's do create an account.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Yeah.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Okay. Well, I have a account already, but I'm just so.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000
I would create an account, I'd click the button. So do I do that, or do I just tell you?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Yes, yes, let's go ahead and create an account.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:58.000
And so I would enter my email address and then choose my, add my, my language.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Not my address, and then I would read the rules of use.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:11.000
I would loosely read them, because they're usually very long, and then I would accept that.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
I read them and could push, continue.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Okay, great. Let's do that. Let's I think, either press continue, or that check box. I think.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Okay.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Yup. Okay.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:32.000
I'm saying, this is, check your email. And then so I would click that and then confirm your email.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Then I would just go into my. I guess this would be in my email.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Add, yeah, that would be my email box. So we confirm the email address.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Would you? Yeah, yeah, let's let's slow down a bit.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:51.000
And then I would create a strong, okay?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Let's no, you're fine.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:06.000
So on that check your email page. Would you be checking your email on your phone or on your desktop?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000
If you saw a screen like that.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Okay.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Yeah, I would probably initially be checking my phone, and it would determine what how you know.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Like, if I was doing this, and it's asking me to change the password.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
I would be on my desktop because I wouldn't be trying to do this on my phone.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:33.000
I've just thought about. So we're setting up a new, a new password.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Yeah, I I would be doing that on my desktop.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Okay, okay, great. So let's pretend that you've created a strong password and click.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
Hmm!

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000
What's that? I mean?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000
It's just like, like, it's just the way it looks.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:12.000
I don't know for me, I guess, having everything in like one little thing where I don't have to scroll it up, and all that other stuff I mean.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
That's to read.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
It's not a big but it was just like, Okay, take the Voice Backup codes and save.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:23.000
So, yeah, these are the ways that I would set up my options.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.000
And face or touch unlock face. Okay?

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Yeah. Are you familiar with any of these? Which one would you most likely pick?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Okay.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:45.000
So I prefer the dumb touch, you know.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Yeah, we can go ahead and set that one click, that one.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Okay.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Are there any concerns, but so initially, when you saw this page this I was more like Oh, I have to scroll through all of this, but we are there any other concerns?

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
After school, and I have to make a decision, and then, like Security Key, like I was like, I don't know what that is.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:16.000
It necessarily. I don't remember that. And then I definitely know I'm not playing with the backup codes because I've gotten locked out of my stuff with that.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:25.000
And then the authentication application is great. As long as your phone is not a problem.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:37.000
So it's like I was just like weighing like which one of these worst case scenario I'm locked out of my.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Phone cause. This is a thing cause if you're locked at of your phone and you have settings on your phone that you know you have to be at your, you know, at your IP in, or whatever it's called.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Your yes, like it becomes difficult to get in it.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:04.000
So I was just kind of going like which one is gonna the easiest, especially with working with the Va.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Or without some other system. But this I think, I think touch is fine.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Our text of voice. Either of those are fine. Maybe I'll just chat text or voice just to just a.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Okay, yeah, whichever one you would like to do today.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Yeah, let's do text to voice and press. Continue.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Okay.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And then pretend that a code was sent to you, and then say, send code.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Okay.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Okay, let's press. Submit.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Okay.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Okay, okay. Just asking for a second one as a backup.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
And so what would my second method be? I guess.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Oh, let's pretend. Yes, today we're not gonna add a second one.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:57.000
But but yeah, it seems like you seem to pleased on that page.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Yeah.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Can you describe more about that?

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Yeah, I think sometimes like I said, if you get in a pickle, it's just great to have a different way, like there's one that's like easy my thumb boom. I did that.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:23.000
But then something might not be working on your phone or you know, or you may not have access to face recognition on a device or something.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:34.000
And so now you can't get into it. So there's it's always great to have to have more than one that you can choose at the at the time.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:42.000
You're doing whatever you're doing like. Oh, for school, we have the same thing like like, when I'm on my laptop. I can use my phone.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:29:05.000
I have the macbook pro I can use my thumb to authenticate, and then, you know, but I can also text or have a so it makes it easier, so that if something's going on like I'm in a place where a phone call definitely cannot happen right, like I have an ability to just

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
get a text, you know.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:17.000
So what do you think that in this scenario you would go set up a backup authentication method in this time?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:29.000
At this time. Yeah. Great. Well, in this case, we're not going to we're gonna pretend that we that we didn't. So we're gonna skip that.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000
So on this screen.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Oh, it says it's a picture of somebody smiling with a check, a green check, and it says your account setup is complete.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000
And that it's gonna share the information with the Va, my email address and Va.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Will only use the information to connect to your account.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
And what do you think this means?

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000
That I'm done with like setting it up.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Just need to agree. That's okay. And then I'll continue.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
And what do you expect to happen when you click, agree and continue?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000
That I can get into my account that I get into my Va.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Tools account. Is that what it's called? Yeah.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Oh, I did. Wanna ask, what does va digital tools mean to you?

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Yeah, I'm not really sure. I digital tools. I guess.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:41.000
It means that it's, you know, one that there's some type of electronic process.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:49.000
And then I guess the tools part some type of resource to help me get my into my information.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:59.000
So again at the beginning I wasn't really sure. That was the thing that slowed me down the most.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
How that language connected to what I was trying to do.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Okay, yeah, thanks for that. Okay, let's press agree and continue and see where we end up.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Okay.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Go ahead and read through the screen and tell me what you think.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:32.000
It just says that I've logged in with for all Va digital tools.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And it says that I have a Va only login.gov account.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:46.000
And so that means and I guess, imagine I know that it means that that you can use login dot go for other websites.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:56.000
But if if I didn't have it already set up, I'm gonna have to set it up with those other sites to verify my identity.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
In your own words. Can you tell me what what process we just went through?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:17.000
I set up a new login.gov accounts to be connected to my.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Va. Based on my Va.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Well, it says digital tools. But my Va account. And I basically went through and use my email and 8 authentication process to set up the, you know, verify that.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:56.000
You know my identity, and and connects those. The accounts to my Va. Account.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Great. Yeah. And did we end up where you expected us to?

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Yeah.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Yeah, okay, do you have any concerns about what just happened?

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000
No!

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
But I'm probably an outlier, cause I'd I use technology a lot.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:26.000
So setting up a accounts and just connecting.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Single kind of authenticating accounts like Google, you know, and things like that to get my passwords and get access to accounts.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Is pretty standard for me, so I once I got over the language part, and the choosing of which tool, to use to authenticate my identity.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:02.000
I was fine, but even I and I would probably be somebody who's like.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
More of a prosumer than a consumer of technology.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000
I even I hesitated, so I don't know how someone who maybe doesn't use technology.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
All the time are isn't quite sure of the safety of things.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000
How they would approach it, how they would feel about the experience.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Can you say more about your hesitation?

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Like, I said. The hesitation was like, I don't know language via digital tools.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:46.000
I hadn't necessarily remembered seeing that the way that the visual thing of the page was, I just scroll versus.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:53.000
It was just like little buttons, did. I could just choose one, and they were just all kind of like stacked you know, in a small space.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:09.000
But you know those were the only like once I got over that and just looked at which one it was more of me trying to think through which one was gonna be the best, as like to mitigate any phone issues.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:21.000
If I was stranded somewhere, couldn't you know, verify it, or if I wanted to use my mobile device more now that I have this setup like I was trying to like, think through that process?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:29.000
And maybe having some bit of information about like what? How each of them.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:42.000
You know, works, or, you know, like something that you can hope if you're on a desktop, obviously over over that, kinda like each one.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Oh, sorry! What each one meant. Each each one does, you know.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Yeah.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Okay, today, we acted like you don't have a login account, but it sounds like you might already have one.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:36:08.000
If you saw this message that pop up asking asking you to set up a login Gov account, how would you react?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Correct. Yes.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
If, since I already have 10, yeah, I'd be like, no, this are right.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Yeah.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Have one, and then I would go back. I would I would completely closed down my browser and then go back in, and then, just like check the cookies or whatever, and delete them like.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000
I I would probably be concerned that something else is.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Okay. So if you saw this message, if you saw a message asking us to set up a a login account and you already have one, you would think that something was wrong.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Yeah, I would think I would again hesitate. Look at the browser, see? Like?

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Did I go to the web? And then, like, Go back, and you know Delete my cookies, and then go back in again and see if it comes up again.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
If it came up again. Okay, it's probably nothing. It's probably just a generic pop up. Yeah.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Okay. Okay. Great. So we've already closed that modal. Let's now click up in the dark blue area.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Let's pretend that you that it's been a couple of months since the last time when she go ahead and click up it.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:36.000
The yeah, just click, pretend that you Yup, okay, show me how you would sign in again.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Or sign in that next time that you come in to via.gov.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
Doesn't matter what I'm trying to do or does. It?

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
No, yeah. Let's let's say that you're coming.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Let's use that same task from before that. You're going to chat with your doctor.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Okay.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Well, I would just have click this. Send a secure message, cause that's what I wanna make sure that I'm doing.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.000
So I would click, go to the, and it would take me to whatever sign on.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000
So, and then like I said, I typically use id me.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:33.000
But now you know hmm! Now, knowing that the login.gov is is cool, I would use it.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Yeah.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
What do you mean by login? Daca is cool.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Well, I use it for other things. I don't. I for U.S.A. Jobs.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
And there's something else I use it for. But there's a bunch of different little things that I use it for.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:51.000
But shouldn't say a bunch, I know, for a fact.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
It's U.S.A. dot com that's the only one I can think of right off the top of my head.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
The id me. I know I use it for that one, for sure.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:16.000
A bunch of little different things, because my veterans discounts and stuff like that when I go shopping like I have to use those to authenticate that I'm a veteran, and they're all tied together for like shopping so like it lows and home

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
depot and you know Ashley Stewart, or something.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:26.000
They give me a discount for purchasing, and so I use Id that me.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Sure. Oh, okay, yeah. That makes sense. So in this instance, how would you sign in pretending that after you've created that account?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Now you're going to come in and log in again.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
You would use that sorry.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Yes, login.gov.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Okay. And why would you do that?

00:39:50.000 --> 00:40:00.000
I mean, cause I've set it up now, and I know that it works, and it's going to connect me to my my V.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
8, all of the the different areas in my Va.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Account.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Okay, great. So let's what would you do here if you came to this page?

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
I'd enter my email address, enter my password.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Excuse me, and then I will sign in.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Let's pretend that you've done that.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000
And before we read this in detail, can you describe to me what you're looking at now?

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Of it says, Verify your login.gov account for use outside the Va.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And so.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:52.000
It says, estimated time. 20 min, and there's what I need to do that.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:59.000
So I would look at it and say, Do I have those things and do I have time to do it?

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Those would be the 2 things which is great. It says it has the time, and it has what I need what I need to actually accomplish.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
It and so I'll pretend like I'm gonna do it I'm gonna verify it just to.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
We can. So I would click that or.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Oh no! No! Actually, yeah. I have a few more questions about this.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Okay.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
So why do you think this appeared on your screen?

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Because I've already created the account with the Va.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:43.000
It's already established and verified. And now it's given me opportunity to do the same with outside the meeting.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Okay, yeah, do you have any initial questions after reading that?

00:41:50.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Yeah, probably. What accounts? Cause? Like, if I'm somebody who's not looking to get employed, U.S.A. jobs is would be right off.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:16.000
The top of my head is the only one I could think of right at this moment, but I'm sure there's others.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Okay.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000
That so having knowing what those other accounts are, and it be useful for me, even do that because yeah, my dad is like 73.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:26.000
So I hope him set his up. He's gonna ask me, why do I need to set up another?

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Some other thing, when I only need to get into the Va.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000
I would be like, Okay, I wouldn't have an answer for you.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
So, so, yeah.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Yeah. What would you tell him?

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
I cause I didn't have enough information.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:55.000
I wouldn't I wouldn't be able to tell them anything which is not what I would do, said helping him set up anything before I even walk into the house.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Or try to hope it might have a list of the different agencies that he can use.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:09.000
This login. That go for, and then I would probably check off the ones for him as we. He say, yeah, use that.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:18.000
No, I don't want that. Yeah. And what that. Then I would say, we, there's 6 of these on here, Dad it's gonna be better for you to just go ahead and do this, because you know.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:25.000
But if I went down the list and he said he didn't need anything but the Va.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
I don't know that I would on it.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:36.000
How about yourself with? Would you choose to?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Yes, because things change pretty rapidly, and just because the is something that I'm not doing right at that moment doesn't mean it.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Won't be something that I that would come along, that that I it made sense to already have it done.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Okay, yeah. So you would do it in this in the same time period as you were like chatting with the doctor.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Yeah. Well, yeah, like, if I was just looking for my like, I went into.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Look at my information, and this was already like I said, and I had the time and the documentation.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Then, yeah, I would do it.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Okay.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000
Why do you think the Va. Is recommending that you upgrade your account?

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.000
I just think it's like I said before, just the system there's some systems, changes.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
And so maybe they want us all to be on this new system.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Are there some system changes? And they just wanna upgrade.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:56.000
You know the the way people access the the the Va digital tools.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Okay. If you chose not to upgrade your account.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:10.000
What do you think will happen?

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:17.000
I I don't know. I guess I just like I'm reading deeper.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:27.000
It says Federal job application. So security benefits. Then I'll just. It will just be a bit more difficult to get into those pages.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Okay, if you had a question about this screen, what would you do?

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Hmm!

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:46.000
I'm not sure I don't see any anything.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Yeah, I'm not sure. I think I just close it.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Okay, well, thank you. We covered a lot today I'd like to spend a couple of minutes kind of reflecting on what you saw before we wrap up.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Sure!

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Can you summarize what it is that you did today as you click through that prototype?

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
I set up my initially the Va.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Only login.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Only login.gov account to get access to the digital tools.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Va digital tools, which is my.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Va account, and so I've followed a few, added my email and got an authentication code in my email.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Click, the link from the email. And it updated, I guess, verified that I was oh, I missed a step.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:12.000
So I initially, when I started the account, I sent my email up, and then the next screen was to decide how I wanted to verify my identity, and that's what I chose.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Text, and it sent me an email. And then I went through the process.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Okay, out of everything that you looked at today. Is there anything that's stick out to you now?

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Yeah.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000
No, nothing that sticks out. No!

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Yeah, anything that was like particularly confusing or interesting to you.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Oh, I mean down here where it says other manage.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Other government benefits and services.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:12.000
You know, like social security benefits and Federal job applications, and that maybe being bold like login.gov, or something cause I didn't originally see that cause. I was saying.

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Oh, I don't know. I'd have to have a list of things, you know, but those are 2 big ones that most of that trans will, you know, want to have an account to get access to.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Okay.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Hey? Is there anything else that we could do to make it easier for you to set up a login account to use with the Vm.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Hmm!

00:48:39.000 --> 00:49:09.000
No, I think it. I think it's pretty easy, and I think as long as how it functions on the website on a desktop on a laptop and on a mobile device, are all user friendly like you don't have to go through any major challenges to like use

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000
it. I think that's that's the only thing I would say.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Okay, okay, thanks for that. You can stop sharing your screen if you'd like.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Okay.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:35.000
So we can. So I can see all of your face so we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts is so helpful as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for veterans before we go.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000
I'd like to make sure. It's clear that everything we did today is not real.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
So you haven't actually set up a login account account, although it sounds like that.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:49.000
You have one, but you don't have to change the way that you sign into Via Gov.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000
You can keep doing everything as you normally have been.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Okay.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000
And lastly, Perry Gene will be sending a Thank you.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Note with a little blurb, that you can pass along to other veterans.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Okay.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
You may know, to provide them with a chance to participate in future research studies. Thank you.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000
So much!

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Yeah, that'd be great. Is it all right to share on my.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000
So I haven't profit for women veterans.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000
So is that okay, to share that on?

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:19.000
I'm sure that. Yeah, I'm sure that's that's totally fine.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Okay, that'd be great.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000
Alright! Thank you. We're done all right. Bye!

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Great thanks, so much thanks for all your Yup. Yeah, we're all done bye now.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Okay.You, too.
