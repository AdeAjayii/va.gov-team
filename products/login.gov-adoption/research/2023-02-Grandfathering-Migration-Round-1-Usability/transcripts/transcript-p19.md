### Transcript

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Okay.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Sure!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay, so I've started the recording. I just want to confirm if you're comfortable.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If I record my screen and the audio as we talk today.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
You have my consent.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Thank you, Mary. Alrighty! Well, let's we breathe through the beginning.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So that's good news I mentioned that we're thinking a lot about how people sign in and access some of our online services at the Va.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I want to learn a little bit more about your experience with that before we start looking at that prototype.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Well, first of all, Mary, how long have you been a veteran?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I was discharged in 91.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Okay. So it's been quite a while. And how long have you been?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Have you been using our online services for about that long or?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Probably not until 2,007.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Okay. Yeah, that's good memory. And do you remember what started you off when you decided to go online?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And do some of the things that you do with the Va.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Secure messaging eases. Communication with my Va.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Providers, and I like keeping track of my prescriptions.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And so we're you introduced to that while you were at a Va healthcare facility.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
No, I had to scope it out on my own.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Gotcha. Okay? And so messaging your doctor was.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
One example that you gave is that something that you still do?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Kind of regularly.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
On a regular basis. Yes.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Okay, when you're doing something like that, what website do you usually type in to message your documents?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I, I go to Google, and then I might type in my healthy vet, and I only use my healthy vet.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Okay? And when you say you only use my healthy vet, what do you mean by that?

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Gotcha!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
There are 3 signing options, and I only use my healthy vet. There's always some issue with the other 2.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Gotcha. Okay. Do you remember what the other 2 are called?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It's okay. If you don't.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I don't. If you want me to go to my phone, I can look them up.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Oh, no! Don't worry about that I think we'll talk a little bit more about the different sign-in methods in our conversation.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So I was just curious. Sometimes it's hard to remember the different options, especially if they're the ones you aren't using.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So I don't want to confirm that you definitely remember my healthy vet, because that's the one you use, but the other ones are less familiar to you. Awesome. Alright!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Correct.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So you usually will sign in on my healthy vet, and then you use that my healthy bet sign an option.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Correct.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Have you ever been to another Va website?

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Oh, my God! Yes, for benefits, and for something with education, and it it was not a user, friendly experience.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So give me just a minute. I have food in the oven.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I want to not burn it.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Yes. Okay. No rush.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Get in there. Okay, I'm back.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Awesome. What are you making?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Oh, wow! Fancy! Can you still hear me and see me?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
No, I can hear you.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Okay, got a little blurry. Okay? Great. Okay. So you were talking about how my healthy bet is a little bit easier to use than E-bits, where you access your benefits and then use another website for education things.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Yeah, but that must have been the Va. Benefits as well.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I'm thinking I don't know.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Yeah, okay? And when you're on, let's talk about the benefits website.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
So when you're on the benefits website, how are you signing into that website?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But let's not even try that, because it must be oh, my gosh!

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
5 or 6 years, so I don't remember.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Okay, that's all right. Well, I think we might jog a little bit of your memory today in the conversation, especially when we start using that prototype.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Okay.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So let's go ahead and start with that. Okay, so I'm gonna send you a link in this zoom chat.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Yeah, yeah. So did you see something just pop up there?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
In the zoom. Okay? In the chat. So I need chat.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But okay, Tyler to everyone. So I guess you want me to punch that.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Yeah. So if you click on that link, it's gonna open up a let's see if I just.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Yes, perfect.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Sigma.com proto. This is version 8 already. Huh!

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So. I am not able to see you anymore, which is okay.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But I'm just wondering it might be because you're calling in from.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Are you calling in from like an ipad?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Yes, I'm on my ipad.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Gotcha. Okay, that's totally fine. So we're gonna work with that.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So you've got the website up. It sounds like you can see.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Well, it's saying, dear Martha.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Yeah, that's perfect. So I'll talk you through that in just a second before we start reading the email what I'd love to do is to have you share your screen with me.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Is that something you're familiar with?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
No, it's not.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Alright. I'm gonna talk you through it. So let's think you're on the ipad.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:42.000
If you go back to the zoom, do you know how to go back to zoom?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Okay, perfect.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Wait a little arrow. And so I'm gonna close the chat and I'm gonna go down to share.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Yup! You're on it!

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Okay. So now, here we go. Share screen. Uha.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Perfect.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So I'm gonna keep that start recording. It's already recording.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Yeah, that's a silly message, hopefully. If you.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And I've got really bad Internet. So.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Okay. We'll see how we go. If it's not working, I can always share my screen.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But it's definitely nice to see you using this on your end.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So here we go with too many apps android auto, Bixby home camera, deck device, care, dictionary.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Which of these options you want me to hit?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Okay, so let me just confirm that I can understand what you're looking at.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Does it say something like it's giving you options for what you can share on your screen.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000
This permission allows an app to show things on top of other apps.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:49.000
You're using. This may interfere with your use of other apps.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Okay. Hmm, that's a little funny. So are you on the zoom?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Call right now. And it's saying that, okay.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Yeah. No, I did what you told me to do.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Okay.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
No, I hit this share screen, and then I hit screen, and these are, I've got like, wait me!

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
A couple options, gotcha!

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000
No, I have like. I probably have 8 literally 8 through Z.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
There's probably 15 or 20 different options here.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Wow, okay, well, let's think so. If you're looking at that, all those options does any of them look like the link?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I just sent you that email, that said dear Martha.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000
No, not even close.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
No, okay, alright! Let's close that window. If you're able to close it.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Okay. We would be, I can. I just need to figure out how.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Give me a minute. Here! Whoops!

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Actually, now, I can see your screen.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.000
You can. Okay.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Yeah, there, we go.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Yeah. So if if you right now, if you just yeah, perfect, you can close all those, let's keep that last one open.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And then if you go back to where you just were so you could see me, and you could see another screen when you were closing. Thing.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I can do you. I'm not. I don't know how to do.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
No, you're doing well, there we go. Okay.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
They're both. They're both really small, and I can't see you.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000
But anyway.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Yes, no, that's okay. So let's click on that one that says, Va, the bottom option. Let's click on that.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Okay. Hmm, that doesn't look like what we thought it would look like.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Got it. Here goes, and it's very slow, and no, this has me at Magenta Portal.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Okay. Why don't you stay there for a second? And I'm gonna send you a link.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And I think it's gonna pop up on your screen.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Okay.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Let's see if it does alright it doesn't look like it's popping up.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Okay, I think maybe if you swipe back up. So we have those little mini screens again.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Oh, I I know where I need to go for that.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Okay.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Okay, perfect, and then and then go to this.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Come on. Okay. So I him. I am. Go to the zoom.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Okay.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Go to the zoom. Yeah, we're working through this.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
We've got it. Alright! Here!

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Is there something that looks like it? Says Chat.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
No, but!

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
What about at the very oh, we go!

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
No? Well, but that's cause. I have at least enough zoom experience.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Yeah, that's great, perfect.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Yeah.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I can do that now I have the I I have the figma.com.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Okay.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Let's click on that. Let's click on either of those links.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Here. Well, they're the same. So.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And it's loading, loading, loading.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
No, my Va providers call it the Va circle of death.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Alright, so it's looking a little bit small on this screen.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So we'll just do our best to read this.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Okay, it's gonna be a little tricky on the phone or the ipad.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
But but we'll work through it, and if it's getting frustrating at all for you, then we we can make a plan. Okay.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
My shoulders are sore, and I am not willing to give up yet.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Okay.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Okay. Alright, I think that's a good attitude.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:35.000
But let me know if we need a little break so now that we have this open what I'd like for you to do, Mary, is to imagine that you've just received this email from the Va.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Okay.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So let's pretend like it says, Dear Mary, okay, I'm gonna give you a second to read this more closely.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Now, and when you're finished I'd like for you to summarize to me what you just read.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Okay, they're gonna make yet another change, and I probably would have deleted this by now.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Okay, tell me more about that. Why would you have deleted it?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Because I am satisfied with logging on straight to my healthy vet, and that it's that simple.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Yeah. Gotcha. Okay? So you feel like you've got a system that's working for you.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So if the Va. Tells you to do something differently, you're like Nope, I'm good.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Yup!

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Yeah, okay, so this this first sentence says, Ds, Logon will stop working for Va, digital's tools soon.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
What's Ds log on?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I have no clue.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Not a clue.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Okay, and what about va, digital tools? Okay? So let's pretend like this sentence said, my healthy vet will stop working for Va digital tools soon.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000
What would your reaction be?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, my healthy vet will take working for Va, digital tools.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Is that what you said?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Yeah, tell me, tell me what your so that's not what it says.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000
But tell me what your reaction would be if that's what it said.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
That I'm very angry, because now I'll be spending a lot of time on the phone.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Sending messages to my Pac team through a real live person.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Which is, which is a big waste of my time as well as the real life person.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Right? Yeah, I totally get that what if it said my healthy vet will no longer be assignin option for Va digital tools.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Soon. Would that change anything?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Did or no ditto to what I just said. I am not.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Okay.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I'm 63 years old. I finally figured out how to use my healthy vet, and I.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Yeah.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000
We have the same log in and password for as long as I've had the account, and I'm not changing, and a discussion.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I definitely understand that I'm no longer able to see your screen I think you're still on the line with me.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Yeah, I'm on the line with you.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Right? Oh, there you are. Okay. Alrighty. Let's I'm not able to see your screen, but I think you're probably able to see the website still, right?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Or are you seeing?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I still see that. Oh, there it goes again!

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Dear Martha Ds login will stop working for Va.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Digital tools, soon.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Okay. Alright. So what we're gonna do is I'm not gonna make you share your screen again.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
I'm just gonna let you look through it. But you're just gonna have to tell me what you're looking at.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Every once in a while. Okay, so sounds like, we're still looking at the email.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Yeah.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Let's look at that second paragraph.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
It says Login, Gov is an easy to use. Secure us government account.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Have you heard of login.com?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Yeah. And I trust the Federal Government as long as as far as I can throw them.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And know I haven't heard of Login Gov.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And I already have, like 18 different passwords. So I really don't give a rats.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Yeah.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Ask if it's easy to use and secure cause the end of discussion.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Yeah, yeah, I totally get that. So you you do like and trust things that are provided by the Us.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Government, but you have a lot of different accounts already. So this is not something that you're thinking about for much longer.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Bingo!

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Okay, that makes sense. So what we're gonna do today.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And you're just gonna have to bear with me. Cause this is kinda how it goes.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
We're gonna pretend like you're setting up a, you're gonna continue.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And you're gonna set up a login.gov account.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Okay, if.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Wait a minute. So you want me hit that blue box where it says, Go to va.gov to create an account.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Yeah, that's sounds right. Let's go ahead and click on that.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And Mary, like, I said at the beginning, this is just a prototype. So we're not gonna be entering any information or creating an account. Today, we're gonna pretend like we are okay.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Okay, so.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Alright, so tell me what you're looking at now.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Sign, in red box login, dot comv green box, id dot meet blue box Ds log on blue box.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
My healthy vet, I would punch my healthy vet.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Right? Okay? So you're used to my healthy vet, does this page look familiar?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Hmm! It looks like the one that always gives me trouble when I go to my health.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Yeah.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Y vet.com on a Google.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Okay. Gotcha. Okay? So it looks familiar, and it usually gives you trouble.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
But you know you would click on my healthy that.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Yeah.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Gotcha. Okay? If I told you that we needed to set up a login.gov account, what would you do on this page?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000
You can just tell me out loud.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Oh, wait a minute. I hit something in it went too far.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
That's okay. What's the page look like?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Let's see, maybe wait a minute.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:05.000
So I have options at the bottom create account. So if you tell me that if I don't create a Ds log on account they're going to kill me, I would go to the box that says, create account.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Okay, got it?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
So far through the phone. Okay?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Yeah, so again, this is just for me to understand what's working. Well.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
So don't feel like you have to answer correctly, or anything like that.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:22.000
There's no wrong answers. We're gonna this is gonna be a little bit of a curve ball for you.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Okay, but we're gonna pretend like we're signing in with Ds log on today.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So I'm gonna let you click on that Ds Logon Button.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Yes. Log on button. Okay.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Alright Nope! And then once we click on that, it says, username and password, right so we're gonna click, we're just gonna click login.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
We don't need to type in any information. Okay, so what's the page?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Login. Okay.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Say that you're looking at now.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000
You are about to navigate away from va.gov.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Okay, what's that mean?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
What an excellent question! I don't know, and I don't figure.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Okay, okay, if you were on the Va website site and you saw something like this, would you have any concerns?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I would log out and start again with my healthy vet.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Okay, gotcha. So we're gonna keep pushing through.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
And we're gonna click. Continue to login.gov, okay?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Can you log in? Okay? Now, it's asking me for my email and password.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Okay, what? What account is this? Who's asking me for your email address and password?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
The va login.gov.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Okay. Gotcha. So the Va. Wants you to set up this account with the Vi right?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Current, correct.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Okay, alrighty. So based on you and your experience, in which accounts that you know you have right now, would you be able to sign in here?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
No, because I don't use an email to sign in.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Therefore I wouldn't know the password.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Gotcha. Okay? So you think you probably have an account?

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
But you don't use an email to get into your account.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
That is correct.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Gotcha! Alright! So what we're gonna click on next is create an account.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
We're gonna pretend like you don't have an account.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Okay, so I hit create an account. And it doesn't do anything.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Okay. Now, it does enter my email. Do you want my actual email?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
No, we don't need to enter any information today. But what's helpful is if you just talk me through what you're seeing here.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:31.000
So what would you do if you saw this page? And you were setting up an account?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Enter my email address.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Yeah, okay. And then, what would you do after that?

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Hit continue. Well, no, I need to hit the little box that said I read next set the login.gov.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Rules of use. Then I would hit, continue.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Okay, perfect. Let's go ahead and do that. We'll click the little box and then we'll click.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Continue, and then you'll just have to let me know what you're seeing on your screen next.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Check my email at martha@gmail.com.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Okay, why is it asking you to check your email?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Because it sent the link to set up the account to my email.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Gotcha. Okay, is this something you've done before?

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Yes.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Okay. Alrighty. So let's click on check email.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
We'll click on that blue button. We're gonna pretend like you're receiving an email.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Now, okay.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I'm okay, wait. And it's not doing anything.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Okay, so.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Confirm your email. Okay, do you want me to confirm email address?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Well, first of all, is this email? Is this looking familiar? Would you have any questions if you saw an email like this?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Why is that?

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:54.000
It would go to my trash it because this does not, because I've been spammed, and I've been hacked, and I'm very sceptical.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Yeah, okay, so you would delete it.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Yeah, go straight to the trash.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Okay. Alrighty. Well, let's click on confirm email address.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
We're gonna pretend, like we're continuing to set up this account.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Okay.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
And what are we seeing now?

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Create a strong password, it must be at least 12 characters, not a commonly used word.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Okay, so when you're setting up passwords for accounts that you have right now, or that you need to create.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Now, do you have any hesitancies or frustrations with setting up and using passwords?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Actually I have the same password for all 18 accounts.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Gotcha. Okay? So probably if you saw a screen like this, you would say, I know what password I usually use.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
I'm gonna put it in here, and then I'm gonna click.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Correct.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Continue. Gotcha. Alright! Let's do that. We'll pretend, like you put in your password that you usually use, and we'll click, continue.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Oh, God! Here we go with authentication, face or touch, unlock security, key.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
I don't know what that is. Government employee.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000
I'm not a government employee. Authentication application.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
I don't know what that means. Text or voice, message.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:20.000
A life does not to be need to be more complicated. Backup codes a list of 10 codes you can printer saved here to when you use the last.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.000
No, I'm just gonna stop using my healthy Vt.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000
And use the telephone instead.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Okay. So you're seeing this page, you're going through the list.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:42.000
A lot of these are looking not familiar, and your reaction is like no I'm not doing this.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Umhm. Yeah.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Exactly. You want me to hit continue, anyway, right?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Well, unfortunately, Mary, this is what we have to do for this hour.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
So you want me to hit hit continue right.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
But after that well, what? Well, first we we actually need to choose an option.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:06.000
So of all the options you mentioned, you kind of gave your thoughts on each one which one do you think you would choose?

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Text.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
I did.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Okay, let's click on text. Okay? And then we're gonna click. Continue.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Right.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
And then tell me what you're seeing on this page.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And your security code via text message or phone call. We'll send you a or we'll send you a security code each time you sign in message and data rates may apply.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Please do not use web based phone services.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Okay, have you done something like this before?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Amazon does it, and Paypal does it to me all the time.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Okay, so familiar with it. Maybe not loving that you have to do it for these other services.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Right.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000
But it's something that you kind of know how it works right.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Correct.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Okay, so what we'll do is we'll pretend, like you put your phone number in and then you're gonna choose text message. It sounds like.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000
And then we would pretend like a code is being sent to you. Okay?

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
So you can click, send code.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Okay, got it?

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Alright! And then we'll pretend like that. Codes gonna go in here.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
So you would type that in where would you get that code from to type in?

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Okay. And then, okay, so.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
On my text on yeah. You've added your first authentication method.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Add a second method as abacco. Alright.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
So when you're reading that, does this feel like it's an option or something you have to do.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
You've added your first and at okay backup needs contingency plan.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
So it's an altitude.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Okay, so do you think this is something that you would choose to set up?

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
No!

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Okay. So what would you do if you didn't wanna set up a second method?

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
For now your account setup is complete. I agree.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Alright. We can go ahead and click on that. Okay? So before we click, agree and continue, are you still looking at this page that says your account setup is complete.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Correct.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Okay, let's talk about this for a second. So what type of account have you just set up hypothetically?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Okay.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
I don't have a clue. Well, it must be Ds log on.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Okay. Gotcha. So it's not super clear. But you think it might be Ds log on that.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
You just set up an account for.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
And that smiling, happy person at the top really makes me wonder what the hell is this?

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
And what are they trying to get out of me?

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Okay, so a little bit. Not enjoying the icon of the person smiling and not super clear, what's going on?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
No? Well, yeah, it's.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
What about that face? It real there's not a problem with the face.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:17.000
It's like when when men in Africa are trying to get money out of me and they send me Facebook friend requests they always pick the most attractive photographs. And that's why this photo or this woman with the big smile makes me a little bit suspicious.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Okay. So seeing someone who's maybe overly happy at the end of setting up your account has meet, you feel a little suspicious.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000
That's fair. Yes.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Okay, okay. So it says, Yeah, go ahead.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:39.000
And wait, and I think it might be a little bit helpful if it said your Ds.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Dot login account setup is connected.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Umhm. Okay? So you could confirm, this is the type of account I've set up.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Yeah.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000
I know for sure. Gotcha. Yeah, I think that makes sense.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
And underneath that it says, we'll share this information with the Va.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Why are they sharing information with the Va.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Because of Hippa.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Okay, right? Okay. And so when it's saying, we will share this information.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Who's we?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
It might be paging, it might be, with civilian providers, from whom I can receive care in the community.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:28.000
It might be with providers, where I've given permission, whatever permission it is to communicate with the Va.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Gotcha. Okay? So it could be a number of different kind of third parties. And you're basically agreeing for this information to be shared with the Va because of hipaa.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Yeah.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Well, I don't. No! Why else it's it's just a legitimate disclaimer.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
I mean.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Okay. So you think if you are reading this, even though things are not feeling super super clear about who is sharing information.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000
And what account was set up? Do you think you'd probably click, agree, and continue?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Because you're gonna tell me to agree and continue during this day.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Yes.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Okay. What if I wasn't here?

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:14.000
But I'm I'm firm in my position.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000
That simple is better. And what I've been using has been secure.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
So why bother to reinvent the wheel?

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Yeah, yeah, I totally get that like, it sounds like, we wouldn't have gotten like nowhere near this far, because you would have said, No, I use my healthy that it works for me.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And I'm ignoring this. So I understand it's a yeah. Go ahead.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:48.000
And and if there's another, if the login that I've used for the last 14 years is just continued then, like I said, I'm just gonna call the Va.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000
And leave old fashioned messages with my provider.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Gotcha. Okay? So you would. You wouldn't even choose to change your login method.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Exactly.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
You would say, Okay, I'm gonna go back to how it was before, when I didn't use secure messaging, and I'm just gonna call them yeah, that's really helpful to understand.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
So what we'll do next, Mary is we're gonna click, agree and continue before we do that.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
What do you think is gonna happen when we click that?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
I'm gonna get a a link to my account.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Okay, so you're gonna get a link to an account that you think is probably a Ds logon account. Okay?

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Yeah.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Let's click a green. Continue.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Yup!

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
And then what are you seeing on this page?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
You logged in with a login.gov.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
What's login? Gov?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:46.000
I don't. I'd assume that it's something that Va.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Employees can use as well as veterans using.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Using whatever, like my healthy bed, or the benefits or.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Okay. So it's something that you said BA employees, but also civilians are able to use this account in order to do things online.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Correct.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Get access to things. Okay, why is it telling you that you've signed in with login?

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Gov.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000
To let me know that I've signed in.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Okay, is it surprising if you're hearing that you've signed in with login.gov.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Yeah.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
I'm not familiar with this, so I don't feel like can fairly answer that question.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Yeah, that's okay. That's a fair answer. So we're gonna read a little bit more closely.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Now I'm just gonna give you a second to read that little text, and then, once you've finished that, let me know if anything is jumping out at you, or you have a question about anything.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
No no questions.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Okay. So I might just ask you a couple more questions. If that's okay.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Sure!

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.000
So we can see here. It says, no, you currently have a Va only login.gov account.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Okay.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Why is it saying you have a Va only login account?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Oh, well, that must mean that. That's not the linkage with providers outside the Va.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Okay. So you can only use your account with the Va.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Whoops. I don't know. My screen would be fading, and I hit the screen, so I just lost.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Oh, okay, that's okay. So is it just looking like it says my Va claims and appeals.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Check.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Yeah, okay, what? Let's continue on. So we're gonna click at the top of the screen where it says, Va, so it's in that dark blue. Okay?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Okay.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:54.000
And so does now this look like the homepage, almost, it says, access and manage your Va.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Benefits. Okay.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Yeah, it depends. If I use my ipad, I get one option.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000
If I use my phone, I get another one. If I use the desktop computer at the Va, it's different.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Gotcha. Okay? Alrighty. Well, what we're gonna do next is we're gonna pretend like you've just set up this login Gov account.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Okay, you've use this login account to sign in once with the Va.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:25.000
And then a couple of weeks go by and you're gonna sign back into the Va. Okay?

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
So we're gonna click sign in. I'll give you a second to find that sign in.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Search. It looks like I'm still signed. Oh, no, there it is.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Here we go again. Login gov id dot me ds log in my healthy ve.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Okay.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
So you want me punch the red box.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
I'm curious to know why you think that's what I want you to do.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Why do you think I want you to click the red box?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Yeah.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Well, and I'm not sure cause we talked about Ds log on, and we also talked about login.gov.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
So I don't know.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Yeah, so it's not really clear kind of what's going on and why we're talking about these 2 different logins.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Correct.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Yeah, that makes sense. I can understand that. What made you kind of lean towards the red box?

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Now my screen is fading again, and I don't.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Wanna, okay? Well, cause it's red and red into his intended to catch someone's attention.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
And it's at the top.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Umhm, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well, let's click on login.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Gov, and then we're seeing we're seeing a page that should say sign in right?

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Check.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Okay. And so we're not gonna enter any information here.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
But we're gonna click sign in. We're gonna pretend like we're signing in with the login.gov account.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Okay.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Okay. And then you're gonna see a new page that has a bit more.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
No, I'm no, I'm not sign in. It's not okay.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
You got it. Okay?

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
There we go verify you. Log in login.gov. Yes, okay.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Okay, perfect. So there's a little bit more text on this page.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000
So I'm gonna give you a second to read it, and then I'll ask you a couple questions before we wrap up.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Digital tools.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Are are. We is the objective that I can also log in to like the Irs with the same login.gov.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Potentially what's making you feel like that might be an option.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Can you tell me what sentence? Maybe, that you're reading?

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000
I because I like to sell puzzles and my sons and epic analogists.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
So I'm just taking a guess other than that. I can't tell you.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Yeah, okay, okay, so you're kind of guessing.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Oh, maybe. Is that maybe because it says for use outside.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Oh, wait! Wait! Wait! Because I went once.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
You I didn't once. Your identity has been verified.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Blah blah like social security benefits and Federal job applications.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Yeah, so that's?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Gotcha. Okay.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
So you feel like that's kind of confirming what you just said about the Irs.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Yes.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So it's feeling kind of clear that maybe you could use your login Gov account for things like the Aud or social security.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
What would you need to do in order to use your login.gov.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
Account for those things.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000
I would need my state issued Id social security number and phone number.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Okay. And what would you? What are you imagining? It's gonna happen if you click, verify your identity on login.gov, and we're not gonna click anything yet. But.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Then I'm gonna get the eternal circle of death.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Okay, is that the loading, the loading circle?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
The blue circle of death. Oh, my God! Yes!

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Okay. And if you didn't verify your identity, let's say you chose not to verify your identity.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:16.000
What do you think would happen? Based on what you're reading here?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Engineering Va. Only I could probably get to my healthy bet.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Okay? So you could probably get to my healthy vet, what about the Irs?

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000
If I verified my identity. Yeah?

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Gotcha. Okay, that makes sense. Okay? And I think this might be, you know, we're coming to the end of the session.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.000
So you'll bear with me for a couple more questions.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Sure!

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
But so what's the difference between verifying your identity?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.000
And then what we did before, what we did earlier in the conversation.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
I, what are you trying? I don't understand your question.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Okay, that's okay. So earlier in the conversation, we put in your email address, you had to verify your email address.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:10.000
You, you know you set up text message, authentication.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.000
So what's the difference between doing all of that? And then what this screen is asking you to do?

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
If I just wanna access my healthy vet, then I'm good to go.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:29.000
If I wanted to go to social security or Irs, then I have to have my driver's license and my phone number and my social security number.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Gotcha? Okay? Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Alrighty.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
So, Mary, if you wanted to you were like, I don't wanna see this information anymore.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:42.000
What would you do? You'll just have to tell me, because I can't see hit.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Hit the close.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
The close. Okay? So it feels pretty simple to figure out how to get out of this information.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Yup!

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
Okay, perfect. So that's kind of the end of my questions on this prototype.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:37:01.000
So if it's simple enough, you're welcome to come back to the zoom app, and we can just have a chat to finish.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Okay, wait. Give me a minute cause I do.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Yeah.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Wanna zoom okay, there we go. Can Yup alright?

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Yup, I can see you, and I can hear you. You can still see me.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Yup!

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Okay, perfect. Well, thanks so much. I know it was a little bit of a struggle getting through the technical issues for both of us.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:31.000
But I think we did pretty well. We have a couple of minutes before we finish, so I'd love to just kind of reflect on what we've done today.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Can you summarize to me what you did today when you were clicking through those screens?

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
I was a guinea pig in a prototype experiment.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Okay. And in that experiment, what were you having to do?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Set up a new account with a different password.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Okay. And what type of account was that?

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Was it? Ds login or login.gov.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
One of those.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Okay. So you set up a new account with either login.gov.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Or Ds log on, and then at the very end, what was the Va.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Recommending to you, when they asked you to verify your Id.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Why did they think that might be a good idea?

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Because it gives me the opportunity to access other Federal Government, whatever.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Through one password, and through one account.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Yeah, okay, that's really helpful. So we did a lot of different things today.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:47.000
I asked you a lot of questions which I appreciate. If there was one thing that we could have done in all of those screens to make things easier for you.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
What would that have been?

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:55.000
The it that face, that Smiley faces the first thing that comes to mind.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000
Okay? The smiley face was kind of bothering you at that end of the process.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.000
It felt a little bit.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Yeah. But it would be real easy for some individual with nefarious intent to develop another something or other like a Us.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Flag, or what donwn on me at first is that I do trust that Va logo.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:32.000
I've seen it so many times, and so when you're shifting from something that I'm familiar with to something that I'm skeptical of before.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
I even started you're gonna have a hard sell, anyway.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Okay. So it felt a little bit unfamiliar.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:48.000
And you were kind of thinking. I want this to. Maybe be more about like the government right now.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Yeah, yeah, that's fair.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Than it feels like it is okay. Okay. Well, Mary, I think that's all of my questions.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Do you have any questions for me as we wrap up?

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.000
We'll do any of the interns. The 2 interns have any questions they want to ask.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Well, they aren't interns. But let's see.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
So Carl is actually a content strategist.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Which means that Carl's working on a lot of the words that appear online and as well as other things.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:32.000
And Cassinia is a front end engineer. So basically, in order for us to show these things online to you, she needs to build it.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Okay.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:42.000
So she'll write the code. So Carl, signa, if you're if you're still awake and you wanted to come on, you're very welcome to.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
No!

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
But don't feel obliged. Hey, Carl?

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Hey, Simia! Did you guys have any other questions you wanted to ask?

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Mary at the end, or, Mary, did you have questions for any?

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000
All 3 of us.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Nope no questions.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Okay.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
No, I just think, thank you. You are very clear with your thinking.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000
I don't have any questions.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Okay.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Yeah, not either. Very useful insights. Thank you for your time.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Oh, thank you!

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Awesome. Well, thanks, Mary, just to wrap this up, we all really appreciate your time.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
We. This is kind of early days, which is why we're getting feedback from you.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:26.000
I do want to reassure you. That the way that you're signing into my healthy vet right now, using your my healthy, that sign in is still available.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.000
So if you went online tomorrow, don't stress, you can continue to use that sign in option.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Got it?

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Okay. The other thing I wanted to make sure was clear is Parian.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:37.000
That the folks who set up this interview earlier. I think Shannon gave you a call a little bit earlier.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
They're going to be the ones that manage payment for the interview.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:57.000
So if you have questions about how you're getting paid, you can ask them, and they should be really helpful and they're gonna also send you a little bit of a blurb that you can pass along to another veteran if they're interested in doing something like this.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Okay. I think that's everything for me. Any other questions you wanted to ask me before we head out.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
No questions.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Okay. Well, enjoy the I think we're all jealous.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
We can't have some fun after this, but we'll have to make it work great.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Thanks, so much
