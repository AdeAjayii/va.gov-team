### Transcript

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000

> Okay, let me start the recording. There we go. Okay. So I just wanted to confirm, are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio today?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000

> Yes.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000

> Okay. Thank you. Now we can get started. So like, I said, we're interested in learning a little bit about your experience with the VA nd how you access some of our online services. So to start, how long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000

> Well I got out in 76.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000

> Okay. So quite a while, that's okay.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000

> Yeah long time. I don't even wanna add it up.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000

> Yeah, that's okay. How often would you say you go online to manage anything VA related.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000

> Pretty often, let's say, 3 times in a month.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000

> Okay, yeah. And do you remember the last time that you signed in?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000

> This morning.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000

> This morning, okay, can you tell me a little bit about that. Where did you start when you when you went online this morning? Do you know which website you are on?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000

> I went to my healthy vet, and then I logged in because I had to talk to my PCP.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000

> Okay. And when you're signing in on my healthy vet and do you remember which sign in method that you use when you go to my healthy vet? There's a couple of different options.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:38.000

> Yeah, the second one, there's 3 of them, the 2nd one says, 'continue to my healthy vet only.' I believe that's what it says, and that's that's where I go.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.000

> Okay. So you're on my healthy vet. And then you're clicking something that says, 'continue to my healthy vet, only.'

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.000

> Right cause. There's a couple of options. I think one of them is ID.me and the other one is, I don't remember.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000

> Yeah, that makes sense. And are you aware, if you have multiple options setup, or you're using just that one option?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000

> I have 2, but I don't think I have others set up to enter my password automatically. That's easier for me.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000

> Okay. So you're generally using my healthy vet to sign in, especially because your password will fill in automatically for you.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000

> Yeah, the way it's set up there. Just put it in. It goes in automatic.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.000

> Yeah, yeah, that's definitely helpful. Do you remember which other one you think that you might have set up as well?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000

> I think it's the ID.me.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000

> Okay. Yeah. Alright. Well, we'll talk a little bit more about that today. And you said you were going online because you were chatting to your doctor. It sounds like, do you usually go in through my healthy vet? Are you ever going to other va websites like there's va.gov, for example?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000

> I don't go to va.gov for that. But I go to va.gov for other reasons. I'm a fiduciary for another vet who mentally kind of challenged right now. So I go there to do fidiciary stuff, only go there like once a year, for that.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000

> But and then I go to va.gov to pay ... [check video]

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000

> Okay. And when you're doing anything related to the fiduciary position, are you signing into VA.gov.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:05.000

> I think I go to va.gov FAST. I think it's ID. me. I'm not sure.

> [link: FAST](https://www.benefits.va.gov/fiduciary/fiduciary_FAST.asp) 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000

> Okay, yeah, that's okay. It's helpful for me to understand. Even that it might be difficult to remember which method you're using for different websites.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000

> It sounds like for you, though, when you're on VA.gov, you might be using a different sign in way compared to when you're on my healthy vet.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000

> Yes, I'm not using my healthy vet.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000

> That's really helpful. Is there anything else you wanted to share with me more generally about signing in before we continue?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000

> No, not really!

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000

> Okay. Okay. Well, I mentioned that we were gonna be looking at a prototype today. So I'm gonna send you a link in the zoom chat. And this is basically gonna open up a prototype on your screen. And then I'm gonna ask you to share your screen with me. Is that something you're familiar with? Okay? Awesome.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000

> Yes.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000

> So I've sent that link in the chat. And then once you open that up, just let me know if you need any support, sharing your screen. Perfect. Yeah, that looks like it's coming up, awesome. So now I can see what you're seeing. It looks like we're on VA.gov.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:51.000

> And so what I'd like for us to do is imagine we're in a scenario right now. So I'd like you to imagine that you've went online because you need to do a task on VA.gov, so let's say it's related to the fact that you are a fiduciary.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000

> Okay. And so the first thing that you need to do is to sign in. Can you show me how you would sign in?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000

> I would just go to the sign in button here.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:19.000

> Okay, perfect. Let's go ahead and click that. And then is this page looking familiar to you?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:28.000

> Yes, ID.me, my healthy vet. And I think that Ds logon... I never use it. I use that id me on my healthy vet.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000

> I remember seeing 3, though, when I, when I go there I usually see 3.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000

> Okay, so you're remembering that when you go to my healthy vet that you usually only see 3 options, right now we're seeing 4 options. And it sounds like the familiar ones for you or ID.me and MHV. Have you ever used DSL?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000

> Can't remember. If I did, it was once. I don't remember. I don't use it.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000

> Yeah, that's fair enough. And what about Login.gov? Have you heard of login.gov, is that something you've tried before?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000

> You know something – with the Login.gov – I was trying to help my brother get healthcare at some point and I think we had to go to Login.gov, but because I was doing it from [a different state than my brother]. We were on the phone. We couldn't get it done correctly, so I don't know what happened to that.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:56.000

> Okay, yeah, alright. So you actually have experience trying to help somebody else set up a Login.gov, and it didn't actually go very successfully.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000

> Right.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000

> So for today, what we're gonna have you do is imagine that you're signing in with –

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000

> If I could just add, I think the glitch that we had was – there was some redundancy in the verify who you are, or something. And my brother has early onset dementia, and it just didn't work.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:34.000

> Okay. And when you say redundancy in the identity verification part, do you remember a little bit about what felt redundant?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:47.000

> I think it was after you enter some information to verify who you are. I don't know if they sent an email to his phone or something or maybe sent a password. But because he wasn't computer literate as much, it was hard for me to help him with it. 

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000

> That makes sense. And were you on the phone with him, you said you couldn't actually see his screen or anything?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000

> Yeah, I was on a phone pulling up my screen and telling him to pull up his screen at the same time. 'Okay, so hit that.' And he was getting messages, saying – I don't exactly remember. It was very confusing. 'Check this over, check that.' I don't remember.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000

> Okay, yeah, that's sounds very confusing. And probably frustrating. And I think we'll talk a little bit more about that today. Actually so for now, what we're going to do is we're gonna actually pretend like we're signing in. I'm not gonna have you enter any information today. But this might be a little bit of a curveball, but we're gonna pretend like we're signing in with Ds log on today. I know you don't really use Dslog on. I think what might be helpful is, if you think about this like we're signing in with my healthy vet it's the same kind of thing...

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000

> So I'm just gonna have you click on Ds log on. And then we're just gonna click login. Okay? So just that gray box.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000

> Yeah, that's perfect. Alright. So let's pretend like we just signed into VA.Gov using myhealthy, alright and then I'm gonna just give you a second to read this screen. And after you've read this, I would just love, if you can summarize for me what you're reading here.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000

> And you want me to read this box that's white, okay?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000

> Yes. Please.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000

> Alrighty. So let's just start by – can you just summarize to me what you just read?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So what I read that one of the long-in portals was gonna be obsolete.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.000
They would use another. This other one which would minimize number of times.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:29.000
You have to identify yourself.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000
But if you go to other websites, you may have to do this double identity thing.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Okay. Gotcha. Alright. So it sounds like something's gonna go away.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And we're gonna ask you to set up a new account.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And it's gonna minimize the amount of times you have to identify yourself.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Can we talk a little bit more about that when when we, when you're saying, minimize the number of times you have to identify yourselves, can you describe to me what that means?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:03.000
What that means to me is like when you get in, it says, Okay, so to verify your identity we're gonna send you this code to a text number.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Yeah.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Alright. Then you get the code. Now you have to punch in this number.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Okay. Good. Like that.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So that sounds like something that you've done before.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Yeah, too many times.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Maybe with another account. Okay, yeah. Okay, so the Va is telling you that Ds logon is gonna go away soon.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
If you set up a login. Gov. Account, we're going to minimize the number of times you're going to have to do something like you just described.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And then you said, but if you went somewhere else, then you might need to do something more.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Can you tell me more about that part of the process? Can you describe to me what that means for you?

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Okay, that means other than sounds like it means to me other than a web healthcare website or healthcare portal, or something like, where I use the F. A. S. T.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Maybe I still have to double, identify, or whatever they call it.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Okay. There's a really loud playing going over me, so I don't wanna yell.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I don't know what a websites are available to people from on the government website, but.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So I'm just gonna give it a second. So that makes sense.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
You're in a oh, you're in a audio pollution zone.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I know, I know my headphones are doing their best to cancel out some of the noise for you okay, so it sounds like there's a little bit of confusion around.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:39.000
What other government websites you would need to access but it's clear that maybe you would need to do something extra if you wanted to do that.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Right.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Okay, that's helpful. And so if this was reading, if it's said to you instead of this saying, Ds log on, we'll stop working soon.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
If it said my healthy vat, we'll stop working for Va digital tools soon.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
How would you react to reading that?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I wouldn't really scrutinize it a lot, because I use my healthy vet regularly.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So I would be like, Okay, what do I have to do?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Yeah.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Right.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And I would focus on on it. I would phone in on it, whereas yes, log on just in my mind.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I don't use thes log on so it's not triggering me.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Right.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
But if it's in my healthy vet, I say, Okay, let me create this new account.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Right? Gotcha. Okay? So you would focus on this a little bit more because it would feel more risky, I suppose, because you use my healthy bed a lot.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I don't know if I would say risky, but more pertinent, important to me.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Yeah, that makes sense. And is that because you are imagining my healthy that, like the website that you using that, you went to?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Yeah.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000
I think you said this morning or yesterday, you're imagining that that might go away soon.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Yeah.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Based on on what we're reading here.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Yeah. Well, not that the website would go away. No, yes.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
No, no, will stop working, so if it's in, my healthy that will stop working.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So maybe they will be changing the name of it, and I would have to.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Whatever news coming out.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Okay. Gotcha. Alright, that makes sense. And you did say that because this is Ds log on, you know you don't use Ds log on.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
You would probably ignore this. So if you were gonna ignore what you're seeing here today, what would you do next?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And you can just describe it to me. You don't have to.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
You don't need to click.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Create a login.gov account.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I don't know that I would just ignore it completely.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I would look at it, you know. Create a login account because it says Ds log on to stop working.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Then I would. It's kind of not relevant to me.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000
So I'm like, Okay, you know, whatever I would just close it and go to the website that's behind it.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Yeah, okay, yeah, how would you get to the website? That's behind it.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I believe if I hit that close button, then this website behind it would just light up.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Gotcha. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So we're gonna do.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Next is, we are. Gonna imagine that we're creating this login.gov account.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And we're actually going to go through the steps to create an account.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Okay? So if we were going to create the Login Gov account, do you know where you would click next?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I would go with here, where it says, Create login. Gov.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Account at the bottom of this white box.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Okay, perfect. Let's go ahead and click on that.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Click on it!

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Okay.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Yeah, yes, please. Awesome. Okay. So if we were setting up a login.gov account, can you tell me what you would do next on this page?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I would just go to each box into your email address, password.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Wait a minute. No, I would go to create an account.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Okay. Gotcha.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Create an account. Okay?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Okay, yeah, let's go ahead and click on that.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Okay, so.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
English would be my default. I read and accept the login.gov.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Rules of use. As nobody reads those rules actually, but I would probably click it so it wouldn't stop me from going forward.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And then you would probably click.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Continue after that. Okay, that's.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Yeah, I would click it, you know. Click it, click the okay.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000
So who's not working? Then I read the rules, and I would continue right.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Perfect. Yeah, let's click on, continue. Yeah, okay, what about this page?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
I'll give you a second to read it.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:40.000
So we sent, we sent an email to you. So I would open my email in another tab.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:49.000
And confirm my email address. Oh, no, it says, check email, yeah, okay, that's new.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Right, okay. So usually, you would open another tab on the same computer and check your email.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Cause I'm used to going to another tab.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Right.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
There, not exactly sure what the button would lead to here?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
But I didn't even pay attention to that button to like, came back and looked at and said, check email.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
So I figured if I hit that button it'll go to my email.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Right? Right? Yeah, that makes sense and when we were talking about your brother and you helping to set up his login.gov account or trying to help we talked a little bit about maybe how the confusion or the redundancy was about checking your email do you does this look familiar is this ringing any

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.000
bells, or you think maybe it's a different part of the process where the confusion was. Hmm!

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Okay.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.000
Yeah.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
As I think about it, now, I can remember the confusion, he said. I told you he has some dimension.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
So he went to what? To setup an account so we're setting up the account.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Then it bounce back this already in account for this email address.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Gotcha!

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Yeah, it's with the confusion setting.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Okay, okay? And so then it was harder to kind of figure out where that account was or what the details were to get into that account.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Bye, right!

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Gotcha okay, that's helpful. Alright.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
So we're back in this scenario where you're setting up your login.gov account.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And we're gonna check our email for today. I'm gonna have you just click on check email, that big blue button.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Okay.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
We're not gonna obviously send you an email right now.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
So we're just gonna pretend like, you're getting an email.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Okay.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
And it might look something like this. Can you tell me if this is looking familiar?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000
If you would have any questions on this page or this email.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
I wouldn't have any questions. Buttons really big.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Confirm your email address. I'll just click. I would click it.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Okay, okay? And it's.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
And hopefully it took me back where I need to be.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Okay, gotcha, and we'll we'll sit on this page now, just for a minute.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:43.000
It sounds like you said you would be open up your email and another tab.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000
So you feel kind of familiar with opening up multiple tabs on your computer.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Yeah.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:56.000
And when you're setting up something like a logging Gov account, or any sort of account, is that something that usually would do on your computer?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Or is that something you might do on another device like your phone?

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
I don't set anything up on the phone cause it's too small for me.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Yeah.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
So I I don't use that for those things.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Okay. Gotcha.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Yeah. So I would just go uz open another tab.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Sound like a big. I like everything big.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Yeah. Gotcha. Okay? Yeah. No. I totally get that. I can't do very much on my little phone.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Awesome, alright. So now we're here, and this page is saying, create a strong password.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:36.000
I'll give you a second to look at this, and then just let me know what you would be thinking about if you saw this page.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Okay, I would just be thinking about what password that I would create.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Yeah.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
12 characters long. That's a be something I can remember hopefully.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Yeah, okay, do you have any concerns when it comes to passwords or using them over time?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:21:02.000
And I would just no!

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:09.000
I might be lax in that area, you know. People say, Oh, your password, you should change them so often.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
The scammers and the hackers. I see my perspective.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:19.000
They come after people with money, I have any so if you want to know who I am, whatever you know, I don't, so I don't. You know.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Yeah, okay.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
I don't. Hello!

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Yeah.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Get into change of passwords all the time, and security.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000
I think the security that's built in is sufficient.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
I'm not doing a whole lot of stuff.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Yeah, no. That makes sense. So it's it's kind of a little bit easier on you if you're not having to change your password.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
So often, and you're not super worried about any reason why you would need to either.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:53.000
That's that's really helpful. Well, we're not gonna have you create a password today. But we'll just pretend like you did. So we're just gonna click.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Continue. Now and then we'll see what's on the next page.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Okay.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Okay, so what?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I think.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Tell me about what we're seeing here.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
This is to.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000
This is I was gonna say, this is like a double a verification.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
So this authentication? Yeah, just to scan these.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
As I looked down, the only one that I would be interested in.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Okay.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Is the text of voice message because I don't wanna face in touch. And the rest of it, you know I don't have government Id, and I don't have security keys, and you know none of that stuff applies to me.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Right.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
So!

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000
That makes sense is a text or voice message, something that you've already set up before.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:23:01.000
We talked a little bit about that before.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Okay, okay, great. So.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Yeah, are you text message? Send me? SMS, not voice text using this extra email.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Okay, gotcha. So text or email would be your preference.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:18.000
So on this page you would you quite quickly figured out you would use the text messages.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
What?

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Your best option, and we're not really seeing a good backup option here or another one that you might have chose.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:43.000
I've always shot away from the face, you know. I don't know I guess you would have to have the camera on, and it would take a picture of something I didn't know how it would.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Yeah.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
But but I've never been kinda got into that.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Yeah.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Yeah.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:01.000
I've used a text message I mean the face, the face, and the fingerprints, and all that more biometrics to just, you know, having the system.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
I guess people were powering on whatever you know I might be.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
One of them. I don't know.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Okay, so let's click on text for today.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
And we'll continue as if we're gonna set that up.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Yeah, perfect.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
A list of 10 calls. Really, I don't think so.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
You're not the first person to say that.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Alright! Alright! Let me know what you are seeing on this page.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Okay. So that looking for that, they have my number there and then say, How should we send it?

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Text message phone call. So I would take a text message.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Okay. Yeah. Okay, let's go ahead and click. Send code.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.000
So we're just gonna imagine that you put in your phone number.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Excuse me, I was up early this morning. Sorry.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:01.000
Oh, you can. Yeah, no, you can. Yawn, and hopefully, maybe you'll have time for a nap after this.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Yeah.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
I'm a big sleeper, so I get it. Alrighty!

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
So we're gonna imagine that you were sent to security code to your phone.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000
And then you put it in here onto the screen. Does that feel familiar to you, or do you have any questions about how that works?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Okay.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
No like to remember this browser, too, so I don't have to do it again.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Okay, yeah, right, we talked about that at the beginning. I remember.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
So let's click on, submit.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Alright! I'll give you a second to read this page.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Okay, second, as a backup.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
So. So I assume that's mandatory.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Okay.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.000
So that's what I will come.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000
I'm not gonna answer your question. But if that sounds okay, yeah. Umhm, alright.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Let's go ahead and skip for now. Then it sounded like we kind of went through all the options.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Earlier awesome. So what is this page? What do you think this means?

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
I'm finished with the account, so I can go forward and do my business.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Yeah, why do you think it's saying that it will share information with the Vi.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
So I can go to the various Va portals.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Okay.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
The accounting, whatever it is.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And what sort of account would you say, you've set up?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
I think I've set up an account to deal with any Federal agency.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And if you had any questions on this page let's say that you were like, I don't understand what's going on.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000
What would you do?

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Let me scroll and see if there's anything. Is a help button down here is the privacy ins.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Yeah.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Information there.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
If I wanted to contact someone. So there's 3 options.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Kind of figure out what's wrong. Maybe the help might do it.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
Yeah.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000
I don't know what I would be looking for, but.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
It's 3 buttons there. Try to get the issue solved.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Yeah, yeah, okay. You found that quite quickly. And would you expect?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Let's say you were gonna contact somebody. Who would you expect to like?

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Let's say we were, gonna do a phone call. You found the phone number when you clicked contact.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Who are you expecting to talk to on the other end of the line?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:47.000
If it was about this page here, we'll share this information.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
I would expect some administrator who could explain to me.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Shared with Hmm, and say, just a digital. So you have access.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Okay. Great. Would that be somebody that works at the Va.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
I doubt it. It would be some, probably a government. It person.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Okay. Gotcha, yeah, that makes sense. Alrighty. And what if we clicked, agree and continue on this page?

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
What would you expect to see next?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:25.000
I would expect to go back to with where we started, so I can enter.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
I don't know what we were trying to go. I know what thanks!

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Go back, then.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Yeah, okay, yeah. Yeah. I mean, at the very beginning, we kind of pretended like you were gonna come online to do a task related to being a fiduciary.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Okay.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
And so you might expect it sounds like that. We would go back to the Va.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
And you could kind of continue and sign in and start doing that.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:55.000
Okay, Gotcha, let's click, agree and continue.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Alright! So before we look to closely at this page, I just want to talk a little bit about what we just did I know we've talked about this before, and it might feel repetitive.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000
But this is just for me to make sure I'm understanding everything.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Okay.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Okay. So in your own words, can you tell me what we've done so far in this session?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:24.000
What we've done is we've created a login.gov account.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:31.000
You know, username password.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Secondary.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Authentication.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:49.000
And then skip the second mode of.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Yeah, so.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Whatever the call, it's second motive. I don't know what they called it, but we split that.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. That's really helpful. I'm gonna give you a second now to read this a little bit more closely.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
And then same thing as we did before. I just like for you to summarize to me what you just read.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:26.000
And okay.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Okay, so.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Okay, so what does this? Yeah, go ahead.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:42.000
So for what what I've read here that what I've done is only for Va using login.gov only for via I want to use it for I don't know social security.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Whatever. I guess other government websites. Then I have to go back, and I'd have to verify my identity.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Gotcha. Okay? And white. We talked about this a little before.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:31:11.000
But can you tell me what verify your identity? What would you expect that to take?

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
If it was simple, just.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
It's the authentication I don't think so.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Verify my identity.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
I don't know.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Yeah, that's that's a totally fair answer.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
So I got the.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:41.000
I mean, we have. You have a lot of things that the people use now last for his social security.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Huh!

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
I don't know if they I don't know how serious.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.000
If they were. Want you to upload them. Ideal. A government issued Id or something, you know I've had to do in the past for other stuff, but I don't know.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Yeah, okay, yeah, that makes sense. It felt like it was clear to you that you've created an account.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
That's gonna work with the Va. But if you wanted to use it on, for example.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Social security, then you would need to verify your identity.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:13.000
It's not super clear what verifying your identity would mean that's really helpful.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:23.000
I have one question. So we talked about authentication.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Bye!

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
When we set up that text code right? What's the difference between authentication and verifying your identity for you?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000
That's what phoned me for a loop right here right now.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:38.000
I authenticate is like to make sure that they're really talking to neglect. Put my phone number in there.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Yeah.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:50.000
This is actually me, okay, identity verification. We need another type of identification I said, maybe upload your driver's license or your passport.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Something like that. I don't know.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Okay, that's helpful. And so again, we're back in this scenario you've signed in.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Let's say, with my healthy vet the Va.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Asked you to set up a login Gov. Account.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
So you went and set up your account. When you finished, you saw this screen.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
What do you think you would do next if you saw this screen?

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:24.000
You know, if I might go and learn more about this verifying the Id, because maybe I wanna use it only have a couple of government accounts.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Yeah.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Yeah.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
You know the social security, and then so.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Save them, to connect them both, or whatever.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Okay. And if you are gonna if you are, gonna use this account.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
This login.gov account with social security. What do you think that you would need to do in order to use this account?

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:49.000
With social security.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Uhhuh.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:57.000
I would probably go. Have to go back to where I said Skip, and I can't remember exactly what was on there, but it was like another identity factor or something like that.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Gotcha!

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000
I probably wouldn't actually complete that process.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Gotcha. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. Alright, that's all.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Been super helpful for me. So the next thing we're gonna do, unless there's anything else you wanted to point out on this page.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Okay. What we're gonna do is we're gonna have you?

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Let's pretend like you were gonna continue on.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000
You needed to do some task on va.gov.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:26.000
How would you get out of this, this modal or this popup?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Just hit the X close.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Okay, let's go ahead and click on that.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Perfect, and then we're just gonna have a little.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:44.000
We're doing a little trick. So if you just click at the top of the screen and that kind of dark part of the screen, just click anywhere.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Yeah, that should work perfect. Alright. So now we're gonna stay on this page.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
So, we're kind of pausing, and we are.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Gonna imagine that you've now signed out of v.com in a couple of months past.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:06.000
So let's say it's a month from now, and you need to go back onto va.gov, and you need to sign in.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Can you show me how you would sign in this time?

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Am I trying to go to the Va. Or just general?

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Like I have double portals, or whatever, because from distance to go to via, we'll just go to the sign-in Button.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Okay, and what that makes sense. And what do you mean by?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Can you help me understand the double portals?

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Okay. Gotcha.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:55.000
I was thinking if I wanted to go to. If I wanted to go to another government website like the security or something, then I would have to change this in the URL to just va.gov and go from there, maybe.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Gotcha. Okay, okay, so let's go ahead and use that first option.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Okay.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
So you're just signing in on va.gov, so you can click on sign in.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:16.000
And then, yeah, perfect. So this page looks familiar. We talked about it a bit earlier, knowing that you've set up a new account with the Va.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
But you also have these other accounts with the Va.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
How are you gonna choose to sign in this time around?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Well, my original one is gonna? Get!

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Okay.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
So I.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
The Ds log. On which one did I sign up?

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Which one did you just sign up with?

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Login.gov.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Umhm, okay, that makes sense. So you're kind of aware that one of your logins are is going away.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
That's why you set up long and not Gov.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
And so it might make sense to use login, dot.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Right.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Gov, yeah, that makes sense. Alright. Let's click on login.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Gov. Then?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
And then on this page, can you tell me what you would be doing on this page?

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:15.000
I'm here because my information is already valid. I would put in my email address my password sign in.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Okay, perfect. Let's click on sign in.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Alright. So again, in this scenario, it's about a month after you set up your login.gov account. And you see this screen. So I'm gonna give you a second to read this, and then we'll talk about it.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Okay.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:09.000
Alright. So first of all, can you tell me what you what this is trying to tell you?

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:16.000
It's trying to tell me that if I go forward that I would only have access to Va.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000
To Va tools.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000
But if I wanted to go to another account, like social security or so I think it's a taxes.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Yeah.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:39.000
I think, anyway, with them, whatever they're not have to do, the verify identity problems which takes about 20 min.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
It's a here as is. I thought that you would have to upload State.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Should I be social security, verifying documents? What information?

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Okay, and based on kind of what we've already talked about.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Did this? Did anything here contradict that, or confuse you?

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
It's what I expected. So excellent!

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Or did it feel like what you expected? Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Yeah, we talked, we talked about how you thought verifying might involve some like an Id or social security number.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Huh!

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000
So this does seem like it would fit in with what you were expecting, and and I can understand that you might use this for something like so security, or maybe for, like the Irs like you said I think that's really helpful.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.000
It doesn't sound.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
I don't know.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Sorry. Say that again.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Is it? Passport renewal? Maybe.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Right? Yeah. Gotcha, okay? Yeah. And so login, dot.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Gov, it sounds like it's something that you can use for different government websites.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Can you describe to me how it's used for those different websites?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
So like, let's say we did verify your identity so you could use this account.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Now for other websites. What would that be like? How would you use it for another website?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:10.000
I could use the Login Gov to go to my social security information.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Maybe log large, a question or check.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000
And by some rackless way they increased it, or something like that.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Yeah, right? Okay. And to do something like that, where would you start?

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Like if we were gonna open another tab right now and do that right now.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:36.000
What website? Would you type in?

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:50.000
I think the login.gov by itself would have a list of all of those websites, not just the Va.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000
I would think so.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Uhhuh, okay. So you could kinda start from Login. Gov, and maybe yeah, gotcha, okay, yeah, that sounds pretty clear.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Let's say that you did have a question.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.000
What we do need to do. So. Security taxation, you know, Embassy, whatever.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Yeah. Okay. Gotcha, it feels like things are pretty clear to you on this page.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:13.000
That's the sense that I'm getting let's pretend, like you had a question.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000
So something on here was not making sense, and you wanted to contact someone.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Can you just describe to me how you would do that? At this point?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Learn more about verifying your identity. Click on the only option on that really.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Okay? Gotcha, yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Perfect, I think, if answered, all of my questions. So I'm gonna let you.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:51.000
If you'd like to you're welcome to stop sharing your screen so there should be a button somewhere near the top of the screen.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:57.000
And then we'll just chat for a couple of minutes before we wrap up.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Share.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Awesome, perfect. It's I always find it like a little bit of a relief when you stop sharing screen, and you can kinda just have a chat.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Well, you answered a lot of questions for me today.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:22.000
If you are going to tell a friend about yours, let's say what you and I did today. How would you describe to them what what you did?

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
What you and I have done.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
That was probably a bad way of saying it. What you've done on your screen just now.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Okay, I I would say, you know, knowing that maybe they have to have the same type of access.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.000
The government is changing the way we log on. So and they have some new information.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
But I but I would tell them that there's a benefit, because you can have all of your access with one.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Login.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Huh!

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Yeah, cool. That makes sense. That's been really helpful.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
And what do you think that the Va. Ultimately recommended that you set up login?

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Gov like there could have been another option. For example, why do you think that chose login?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000
To centralize a collection of data. So we can know where everybody is.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
At every every moment. You know what they're doing.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:24.000
That's a fair answer. And if that is kind of what you think in this scenario, how do you feel about that?

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000
I mean. That's what that's what I think in my.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
My world of thinking, in my practical application, I really could get less.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Okay.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. So do you think you kind of think about it?

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Like, you know, the Va. Is telling me. I need to do this.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:49.000
So I'm gonna go do it. And I'm not gonna like, think too much into like what they made me do this specific thing.

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Yeah, okay, I think that's fair.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
No! But if you want to discuss, you know the conspiracy, we can go deep into that.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Rather hope, awesome.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.000
I think we might need another hour if we were gonna awesome.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Well, I think you have answered all my questions. It's been really really helpful to have this conversation with you, but I do wanna give you a chance to ask me any questions.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
If you had any, or if anything came up during the session.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
No, no, no, you know I expect them to roll that out, though the login.com.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
So if it's not already rolled on already, we'll see.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, so right now, you are able to use login , go with the Va, but some of the things that we were looking at right now are not necessarily like decisions or real, you know, real things that are are ready to be put up online so I do want to reassure you that if for whatever reason

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
you wanted to use login duck with the Va.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:57.000
You are totally welcome to if you wanna continue signing in as you have done, like. Please don't feel like you need to change anything based on our conversation today.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Okay. Awesome. Well, I really appreciate our conversation. It's been great having a chat with you, and it's been really helpful to hear your feedback as well.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
I think we're kind of wrapped up here.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
I want to make sure that you're aware of Prisian. They're the folks who set up the interview with you.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:22.000
They're gonna be the ones that are managing, paying you.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000
So!

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
So if you have any questions about that, you just let them know they're they're also gonna send you a little note about how you can get other veterans.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:40.000
If you have any other veteran friends or folks that you know, that wanted to do something like we've done today they'll send you a little blurb, and you could share that with them so I think that's everything for me.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Did you have any other things you wanted to ask? Okay, awesome.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
No. No. Okay.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Alright. Well, thank you so much, and have a great rest of your day.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Thank you.Bye.
