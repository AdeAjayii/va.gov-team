### Transcript

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000

> Awesome. So [participant 2], I just wanna confirm, are you comfortable if I record this session?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000

> Yes, I am.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000

> Thanks so much. Alright, I think we can get started now, if that works for you, [participant 2]. Awesome so I just want to start by learning a little bit more about you and your experience with the VA. And particularly with using some of our online services. So I'm going to just ask you a couple questions.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:36.000

> How long have you been a veteran, [participant 2]?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000

> I got out of the service in '94.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:53.000

> Okay so quite a while. And how often would you say that you go online to manage VA benefits or healthcare, or look up some information?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000

> This year a lot more than I did in the past to be honest. Yeah.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000

> Okay. And what does a lot look like is that a couple of times a month?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000

> Probably 3 to 4 times a month. Yeah.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000

> Okay? And when you're going online, do you know which website you're usually going to?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000

> Hmm what is it? MyHealtheVet [MHV]. Yeah, that would be MHV. That one!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000

> MHV okay. Great. Yeah. That's helpful.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000

> And are you usually going to MHV and just like kind of looking for some information or are you usually signing in?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000

> Looking for information.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000

> Okay, and how often do you? Would you say you are actually signing in?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000

> So you're entering your username and your password when you go to MHV.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000

> Well, every time I log on in, so that'd be 3 to 4 times a month.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000

> Yeah.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000

> Okay. Do you remember? I'm gonna test your memory a little bit but we'll do that a little bit throughout the hour, so you'll have to bear with me.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.000

> Do you remember which way that you're signing into my healthy bet? There's a couple different options when triggering any memory?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000

> I got it as a favorite, and then I click on that, and then it drops on down, and then there's like 4 choices.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000

> I think. Then I click on on my health. That, yeah.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000

> Okay, okay, so it sounds like, you're on the my healthy that website. And then you're choosing my healthy bat as your sign in option. Awesome.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000

> Right.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000

> That's really helpful. And that's usually how you would sign in.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000

> Is there ever a time when you're choosing a different side?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000

> No. Nope!

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000

> Okay, that's really helpful. So the next step we're gonna do, [participant 2], I mentioned that I'm gonna show you a prototype today.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:51.000

> So that's that kind of pretend version of the website.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000

> Okay.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000

> And this is so that we can get your feedback. This is for, you know, a time for you to share your opinions about what we're looking at.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:01.000

> So I'm gonna send you a link into the zoom. And I just like you to open the link on your computer. And then, are you familiar with sharing your screen?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000

> Not really?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000

> Okay, that's okay. I'm gonna talk you through it.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000

> So I've sent you a link in the chat.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000

> Yup!

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000

> And so if you go ahead and open that link, you might not be able to see me for a second.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000

> Okay. Let me click on that link then.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000

> Okay. So you see that opening up?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000

> Yes.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000

> Alrighty! So once that opens up, you're gonna try and find zoom again.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000

> So come back to.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000

> Yup, see yup.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000

> Okay, perfect. And then at the bottom of the zoom window, we were talking about this earlier.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000

> It says a couple of different things, and there's one in the middle.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000

> It's green, it says, share screen. You see that? Okay, perfect.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:08.000

> So if you click on that, it's gonna give you a couple of options, and you can go ahead and try and find that window that you just opened.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000

> This one?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000

> Okay.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000

> Perfect, alrighty. It's just loading and I'll let you know what I can see. Once it comes up.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000

> Okay, that's so [participant 2], just for your familiarity.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:33.000

> Now, what I'm seeing is basically what you're looking at on your screen so that Va email that's coming up on your end.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:45.000

> Okay.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000

> Alright!

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000

> Okay, okay, great. So we're gonna keep this prototype opened throughout a lot of the conversation you can always come back to the zoom window if it's feeling a little funny talking to the Internet. Alright.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000

> So what I'd like us to start with is just imagining that this is an email that you've received.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000

> So it says, dear Martha, like so you received this email from the Va.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000

> I'm gonna give you a second now to read the email more closely.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:31.000

> And when you finish, what I'd like is, if you can summarize what you reallyve read for me.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000

> Okay.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000

> Okay. So just to start, can you tell me a little bit about what you just read?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000

> Is that my login for the Ds login is that's gonna be no longer available.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000

> I'm gonna have to create a new account@login.gov.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:22.000

> What does what does that mean to you?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:31.000

> I don't know more or less they have to create another account, create a new password and user.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000

> Okay.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000

> Id for another area. Yeah.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000

> And I'm sensing a little bit of confusion like it's not feeling super clear yet.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000

> Is that true?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:49.000

> Correct. Yeah, I'm not real sure what the Ds login site is off it.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000

> Yeah.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000

> Top. My head. Okay, that's where the confusion is.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000

> And I'm like, okay, if that's the original login site.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000

> That's fine. And I'm used to creating other usernames and passwords.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:10.000

> And other accounts for thanks.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000

> No!

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000

> Correct.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000

> Okay, that makes sense. So it's not so much confusing that you'd have to set up another account but it's but it's quite confusing that you're not really sure what Ds log on is okay, that's helpful.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000

> And so what is this email asking you to do?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:31.000

> I'll go to logging.gov and create an account, you know, so I can access.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000

> You guys, my records.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Uhhuh. And when you read this email, let's say you decided.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I don't want to set up an account. What do you think would happen if you didn't set up an account?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I won't be able to access anything on the Internet.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Okay.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Yeah.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And so, if you were someone who was reading this and wasn't completely sure what Ds log on was, but knew that you'd receive this and it's telling you to set up an account, otherwise you might not be able to access anything on the Internet what would you do next and you'll have to try and imagine you

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
know this kind of hypothetical scenario.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I wouldn't say if I did not recognize the Ds Login account information.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Haven't just deleted.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Okay, yeah. So it feels like it might not be relevant for you, or you're not exactly sure what it is.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And so you might ignore the email.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Oh, yeah, I just the way things are with fishing and scams and stuff like that.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000
If I don't, if people don't recognize the site off, you know, right off the top of their head, they're gonna delete it.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Or not even open it up.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense. Right? Yeah, that makes sense.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:03.000
So if I told you you needed to set up a login.gov account, what comes to mind any sort of reaction to that?

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Not really no, no, I.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Okay, it. Sounds like you've set up some accounts in the past.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Oh, yeah.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So!

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Okay.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Yeah, that's what I was doing this morning. I've been doing about 6 of them.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:26.000
6 of them. Oh, gosh, okay, yeah. So it sounds like something you're used to being asked to do.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Maybe, okay. So for the purpose of the rest of our conversation, [participant 2], and I'm gonna explain a little bit about Ds log on now.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So Ds logon is another way that you can sign into Va. Services.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
So we were talking about how you use my healthy vet.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:10:00.000
You choose that sign in Ds. Logon is another sign in option that you can use, and so I can see how it's slightly confusing, because you're used to using my healthy vet, so what we can do is maybe just imagine that this email said you know my healthy bet will stop working soon and we

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
need you to set up a login.gov account.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
How would that may be change? How you reacted to the email.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Well, I know I'm I'm familiar with the site.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Then I would take the proper. I would take the proper steps to create the new account. There.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Yeah.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Okay, yeah. So you'd feel less kind of hesitant or like, this might be phishing because you recognize the name.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Correct.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Okay, yeah, I think that makes sense. And again, imagining this, said, my healthy, that will stop working soon.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:41.000
If you had any questions about what you were reading in this email, what would you do?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Let's see here. I'll look for a phone number for for a support group.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Yeah, is that phone number.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
There's support, help line so I could contact them. Make sure that Yup, to make sure that this is legit.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Okay, so that might be the question you have is a phone number.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Yet your preference when you're trying to contact the vendor, or really any kind of service.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Talk to a live person. Yes.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. So what we're gonna do next, [participant 2] is, we're gonna imagine that you decided to continue today to set up this account.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Okay. So if you wanted to set up the account, what would you do next?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Of one thing I would print off this email, so that I can rough it.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Yeah.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
It's just me. I can't remember things, and I can't go back and forth.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Yeah. Can you tell me more about that? So when you say you know you wouldn't want to print the email, and you don't want to go back and forth.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Is that? Are you kind of speaking to like wanting to have one thing open on the computer at a time?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I just get, yeah.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And so you'd rather have the printout next to you.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Correct. Yup.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
That's helpful. Okay?

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Yeah.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
That's just me, you know, I just for yeah.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
But yeah, then I will walk. Look at the email and make sure that go through the steps.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And yeah, go to Va dot Cov and sign in with my login and account and follow that instructions.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Okay, perfect. So yeah, that makes sense. So it sounds kind of straightforward.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:24.000
If you decided to set up an account. So let's go ahead and click on that blue button that you see there.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Go to the Da.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Yeah, that's perfect.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Okay. So I think, it might be loading. It looks a little blurry.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Yup!

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Does it look a little blurry for you? Okay, we'll give it a second.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000
So we can kind of see it. It's a little blurry, but it's a sign in screen, right?

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And it's showing us a couple of different options, is it?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Does this look familiar?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Not off the top. My head! No!

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Yeah.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Well it might. The 4 choices!

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Oh, yeah, but I can't make them out. So maybe like.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Yeah, that's not part of the test. The blur.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
No!

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Why don't we? Let's try and refresh the page.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:30.000
So, Dean, how to refresh the page. Yeah, up there, let's try that and see if it makes it a little less blurry.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Oh! There we go! Perfect!

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Ariel, yeah, this. Okay, yeah, yeah, that recognizes. Yeah.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Like, I said, Yeah, then I usually go down to my my health.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Vet.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Okay, so this looks familiar. Yeah, usually, you'd click my healthy.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Oh, yeah.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:51.000
That, okay, perfect. So after reading that email, we had decided we were gonna set up this login.gov account.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So we open the sign in screen. And what are we going to do next?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:05.000
The login. Gov, click on that one, or actually, or create an account.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Pro create an account, since I would assume I don't have one.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Yeah.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Okay, so you've gotten an email telling you to set up login.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Gov. And so you open va.gov, and you're like, Okay, I've got a setup login.gov.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Yup!

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
That makes sense alright. So I'm gonna throw a like a curveball at you.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Now, so the next thing that we're actually gonna do now is sign in with Ds log on.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
If I tell you we're gonna sign in with Ds log on.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Remember that email said, you have a Ds log on account it's going away soon.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
We need you to set up login. Gov. And now I'm telling you to sign in with Ds.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Log on. How do you react to that?

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Little confused, and ask, why?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Yeah. What if you wanted to ask someone, why, right now, do you know what you would do?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Call that number.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Yeah. Okay. Do you think of yourself as a patient enough person that you might decide to call that number?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Oh, yeah, I'll call him and sit. Yeah.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Okay, yeah, that's helpful. So I'm gonna let us continue.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Now, [participant 2], and I know that you use my healthy vet to sign in.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So you're gonna have to use a little bit of an imagination today.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And we're going to pretend like you use Ds log on.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Hey!

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Okay. So if you click on Ds log on next and then we're just gonna continue as if you're signing in with Ds log on today, so we won't have you put in a username and password again, this is just a prototype.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:41.000
So it's not real. We're gonna have you just click login. Now.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Do you see a lot in? Yeah, that's perfect. Alright.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
So we're gonna stay on this page for a minute. Now.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Okay, so I'm gonna give you a minute to read this more closely.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And then, same thing. I'll ask you to summarize what you've read to me.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Okay.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Okay. So can you tell me what you just read? [participant 2]?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Is, and we're gonna be navigated away from va.gov.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
This page into login, dot go to create an account. Once I create that account I'll be sent back to Va.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Dot gov.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Okay, Gotcha. And is there anything about that that is confusing or surprising?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000
This had the thing. I thought I was just back@loginurva.gov.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
But that wasn't so.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
I was just you know, like go back and forth so that was a little bit.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
I did read it a couple of times, just to understand so.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Okay, so yeah, it sounds like, you're gonna be bounced around a little bit.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And it kind of feels like it came out. I mean, it feels clear.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
But it took you a little bit of time to understand what was going on.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Alright! Correct!

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And so what would you expect to happen next if we were gonna continue to login.gov.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Oh, but click on the button! Then I would take me to that, Gary and I would have to create a new.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And create an account password user. Id, and then, once that is earl, any other information, and once that's done, submit it, and then I'll be sent back to v.gov.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Okay. Gotcha, yeah, that makes sense. And I promise I won't ask you this question.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Okay.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:24.000
500 times, but maybe a 100 times. If you had a question on this page, do you know how you would get help?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Okay.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Yeah, probably go up to contact us or hit the back button.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Look for a number.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense so let's go ahead and click.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Continue to log in.gov, and we'll start to set up that account.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Okay, great. So before you click on it here, can you tell me what you would do first if you were setting up a login.gov.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000
I'm looking at the page right now, looking for anything that says, like, yeah, first time using login, dot.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Gov, yeah, and create an account. Anything like that?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000
When you got help and you got contact information there which is very, which is needed.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Okay.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Yeah, that's what I was looking at. And then, yeah, first time users.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And okay, and create an account. Yeah?

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Okay, so that felt pretty quick for you to figure out where you needed to be on this page.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Oh, yeah.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Okay, let's go ahead and click. Create an account.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Okay, so as we go through the next couple of screens, [participant 2], I would just love to if you can tell me out loud what you would do next.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:52.000
And if there's anything that seems confusing or surprising or different, you can ask me about it. And so we can have that sound. Okay.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Yup, first thing I'm gonna be want to scroll down to make sure I can see everything contact help.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
There's any like any hidden buttons, you know, like anything like that.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:16.000
And look at the enter your email address. I would look at I type that onion, select your email language, English Yup.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I have read and accept. I click on that and open that all up and scroll through.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
See if there's any hidden buttons. You know any boxes that you know.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:38.000
And click. I have read and just scroll down and make sure I'm not missing anything, and then click, continue.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Perfect. Yeah, that was okay. Let's click on. I read and accept.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:48.000
For today. We won't have you read the rules, and then.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:21:07.000
And same thing on the screen. Let me know what you're seeing here.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Alright. I'm gonna open up my email, whatever email you know, on a Friday.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Okay.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
And look for that email and then open it up. Follow it, you know.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Click on the link if it needs, and then also get me back here.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Okay, and this process that we're doing right now, you know, we're obviously on your computer.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:38.000
If you were gonna check your email, would you do that on on the computer as well?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Or would you do that on your phone?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
I would use. I would do it on my computer.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Okay, gotcha. So for today, we're just gonna have you click, check email.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
And we're gonna pretend, like you received this email.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
So go ahead and click, yeah, perfect. So we'll pretend like you received this email.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Is there anything jumping out at you here, as you know, potentially confusing or not?

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:14.000
What you expected.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
Is this something you've done before?

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000
I don't think so. Oh, yeah, numerous times. I think it was fire 24 h. Okay, confirm your email.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Okay, so sounds straightforward. We'll go ahead and click, confirm email address, and we'll continue back to login. Gov.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Okay, perfect. So on the screen, same thing as before. If you could talk me through what you would probably do if you saw this screen.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Okay, email is confirmed. Great. I just gotta.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:06.000
I'm just going to assume that my user ideas, my email address.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Does that feel like it's not okay.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Okay. No. I find no, a lot of sites that I work with.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Use that, you know, and it it's just.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
That's the one thing I notice. I'm like, Okay, upgrade to the password.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Okay, gotcha. So.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Not letting the person know. All right. Your user. Id. What's my user?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Okay, so it seems like you never had to set up a username or a user id, it's skipped right to jump to the creating a password.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:43.000
And so your assumption would be that your email would be your username.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Okay, perfect. Thank you.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Correct most. I'm not going to assume.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Yeah.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Maybe some people might not get that. No, you're looking for alright. Now, I gotta create a user id, or do I create a user? Id?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Yeah, that makes sense. And what about setting up a password? Is this?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:12.000
I mean, it sounds like you've set up a lot of accounts today, even is setting up a password something that you have any hesitation about, or frustration, or anything like that.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000
No!

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Okay.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Sorry, enjoy it!

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Alright perfect! What do you enjoy about it?

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Hey? Just gotta write it down on in my pad.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Okay. So that's where you keep them. That's smart.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Yup!

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Alright, so you would probably create a password and then grab a pen, write it down, and then maybe click, continue.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
I would show the click show of passwords and make sure it's written down.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Correct.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:56.000
And password strength. Make sure it's correct, and it passes all the protocols for it, and such.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
So then yeah, then hit continue.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Okay, perfect. Let's go ahead and click. Continue.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Alright!

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
So I heard a little bit of a sound on the other end.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Yeah.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Can you tell me what that? What that was? What was that describing?

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Awesome two-step authentication method setup.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Yeah.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Tell me how you feel about 2 step offentication setup.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000
It's very needed, but sometimes you can be a pain in the butt.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Of for one. I'm not doing the face or touch unlock cause.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Yeah, yeah, fingers and thumbs. Yeah, they're just change.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
It's just a pain in the butt security keys.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Okay.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
It don't like using the USB port.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Text, messaging or voice mails, I get that. Do that all the time.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:13.000
And then I think the office authentication application that's sort of like.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:22.000
What I wanna say like a third party software. You gotta like type in a number in a certain timeframe I got like 3 of those.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Okay.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Then you just gotta remember which one goes to which one you know.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Right? Right? Yeah, okay, so you're leaning towards it sounds like setting up text or voice message or potentially, the authentication application.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Yeah.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense. And.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
I I don't. This is more like another hassle.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000
It's just another stuff, but I totally. It's needed.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
So!

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
Why do you think it's needed?

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
All the schemes and all the phishing people taking people's identity.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Id theft? So yeah, it's a major thing. It's a major thing.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Okay. So it feels a little.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
For, for for my industry.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Okay, gotcha. So from your perspective, you want to have this setup. But you don't wanna have to deal with it where it's a little bit of a nuisance dealing with it.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Alright! Alright!

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Yeah, okay, that makes sense. So let's set up text or voice message today.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.000
So if we were gonna set up text or voice message, what would you click next?

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Perfect.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.000
And then you can go ahead and scroll down.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.000
And we'll hit. Continue. So what we're gonna do now is set up.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
Oh, let's see if it works. Hmm!

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Do you? Wanna click, continue one more time. I think this seems like a a prototype problem.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
What about if we click backup codes? Let me see if that changes anything? We're actually sorry.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
[participant 2], let's click up above the one you almost chose.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.000
The authentication, application and click continue.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Okay, so it looks like the text message one wasn't working, which is helpful for us to know.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
So we're gonna pretend, like you're setting up an authentication app today instead.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Yup!

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Let me give it a nickname. Open up here!

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Okay.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Tell me what you're thinking when you read through this page.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
No confused.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Okay, tell me about what's confusing.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
We're gonna go. Get where to scan the bar code, where to get the app.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Okay. So it maybe was not exactly what you were expecting.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
To see.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Right now I'm where would I need?

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000
I'm looking for the app. So where would I find the app to scan?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Or am I thinking wrong?

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Yeah, I'm gonna be annoying and not answer all the questions right now.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:59.000
But I think it's helpful to see what's confusing.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Great.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000
So it seems like not clear how you would, or where you would scan this barcode, and maybe what app that it's talking about.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
Okay.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Correct. I don't see a name. Open your authentication, app.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Okay.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Okay. Yeah.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Where do I go to get it?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Yeah, I can see how that's not making a lot of sense for today.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Okay.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Let's just imagine you were setting this up and you saw this, and you were like, wait this is kind of confusing me.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
I actually don't want to use this method. What would you do?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Click! Go back, try another. I try another train, another one.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:38.000
Okay, you click the back button. Yeah, try them. Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Well, for today. It's seemed like you were leaning towards setting up a text message, and obviously we weren't able to do that today.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
But let's continue with the authentication app, and we can talk through it.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Maybe a little bit at the end about how this would actually work.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:31:04.000
So we'll just scroll to the bottom. We don't actually have to do any of this for the prototype, and we'll just click, submit!

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Okay, perfect. So let's say that the two-factor authentication was added to your account, and then we'll keep going.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
So what? What is the screen telling you?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Oh, it's telling me that a texture voice message was added to my account.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Even though we were trying to do the.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
Authentication, App.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Yeah, that is, that is quite confusing.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Oh, that was! That's a little confusing.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Add up second method as a backup. Okay?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
So I can create another one.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Do you think that's something that you would choose to do to set up a backup method?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Yes.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Yeah, why is that?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.000
Umhm. Yeah.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Case I get in case there's no text messaging or voicemail service I wouldn't want to have another choice to receive that information like the email or something like that.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
So!

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Yeah.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:38.000
And you know some of the options we talked through. It felt like you were leaning towards a text message or maybe using the authentication app which turned out to be maybe not something.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Right.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Do you remember anything else on that list that you might set up?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.000
We kind of said no to security keys, no to to the face or touch on.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Right. I didn't think I had like the Government. Id.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Umhm. Yeah.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Oh, only 3, or those, the other ones that I remember actually listed off so.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Yeah, yeah. So it might feel like, you all have one option.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Yeah, one or 2. Okay.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Okay, so for today, we're just gonna we're actually gonna skip setting up another meeting.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Okay.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000
And so if you scroll down a little bit so you can see the whole screen, we'll click.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
Yep.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Yeah, we'll click on skip for now. Perfect.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Okay, so what's the screen telling you?

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000
You're going is your account setup is complete.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000
We'll share this information with the Va. My email address.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Okay, just.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Okay.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Like a privacy, notification, no, more or less. And then, yeah, agreed to the conditions and continue.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Do you know why it's it's telling you that it will show the information with the Va.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000
I'm going to assume. It's part of the Va website that remember creating.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
So it's gonna have to be a sharing with the Va.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Okay, so it feels like, maybe we're on the Va website.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:28.000
And that's why it's being shared with the V.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Yeah.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
I kind of like, the, okay, yeah, that's helpful to know.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000
So if we clicked on a green, continue, what would you expect to happen?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Hopefully. It takes me to my home page.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Umhm, and what kind of homepage would that be?

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Va.gov.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Okay, yeah, alright. So let's click on a green contain, continue, and we'll see what happens next.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Okay, so we're seeing this screen. Now.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
This looks like it might be a duplicate. [participant 2].

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
I'm not gonna not gonna lie to you. So let's click on a green.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Continue one more time. We'll pretend like that didn't happen.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Alright! Here we go!

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:38.000
So is this the kind of you talked about? You felt like you would get back to a homepage and potentially on ba.gov, is this sort of looking like what you had expected?

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Yeah.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Yes.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
Okay? And before we before we kind of read this too closely, yet I would love to just reflect a little bit on what?

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Just so. Where were we before, and what were we doing?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
If you can just describe that.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.000
We were at Login, Gov. Creating an account.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:10.000
So we created an account, I mean, we're told.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Well, actually, we are@theva.gov. Site first, and then we went to the Gov. Created an account.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Then we are told, you know, after creating account, login.gov.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
It would be then to the va.gov. Site.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Make sure all done. So that's yeah.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
Okay. Yeah. And that's where we are. Now. Yeah, that's perfect.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Yup!

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:34.000
That's helpful. So I'm gonna give you a second now to read this screen a little bit more closely.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.000
So we're seeing some sort of popup here. It looks like and then when you finish reading that again, I would just love.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:37:09.000
If you can summarize to me what you've read.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Okay, so what's this telling you?

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:25.000
The popup is more or less saying, I can use my log login.gov account.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:31.000
All va, digital tools, I'd have to check into that further cause.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:53.000
That's new to me. No one, even if I want to use the account for any non va digital tools and other government sites I would need to log back in to login to verify my Id did not know that either.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:04.000
So I wouldn't possibly given in on the time, busy I was, I would probably click on that verifying.

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
They're more of all verifying your idea. Login, Dot.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Go get rid of that, and then just probably search around. Just see what else are available.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Okay. So there's a lot of a lot of different things that you're picking up on here that I want to chat through.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:34.000
So the first one, I think, that you mentioned was Va digital tools, feeling maybe.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Can be hindsight, never knew about it, so.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Yeah. So it doesn't fit really clear. What would be a digital tools is right?

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Yeah.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Correct. So I would have to search to see where. If there's a tab, you know, behind us, you know. And actually, those what sites are.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Yeah, okay. And so you know, you set up a login.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Dot gov account. You know that you can use it with Va, digital tools.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Correct.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.000
But you don't know what va digital tools are so it's not, yeah. Okay, that's perfect. Thank you.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:12.000
And then there's this note, and it's telling me that you can use your account for non vij digital tools on other government websites.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Right.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
If you verify your identity, what does it mean by other governments?

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Hmm!

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
I'm going to assume it like that. Hmm!

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Not sure could be like social security.gov or irs.gov or anything like that.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
I'm discussing.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, that makes sense. Are any of those other websites.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000
One.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
So security. Yeah, I got my own account. Hey? Direct clients to that.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Site for their so security benefits. And then Irs is for any research or information education.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Okay, alright. So, feeling pretty clear on what other government websites might mean.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Why might you want to use this login.gov account for those websites?

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Can you talk me through how that would work?

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000
I would not know to be honest.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Yeah, yeah, that's fair. And so we talked about how it's letting you know that you'd you might need to verify your identity if you wanted to use this one.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:40.000
And you mentioned that, depending on the time, if you were already going through this account setup process, you might just decide to continue and verify.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Right.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Yeah. And so, if you wanted to do that, what would be the next thing you did on this page if you wanted to verify your identity with La.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Oh, you go to like the go to my profile, please click on that to have to see what that leads me to what I scroll down, actually, what I'm doing right now.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.000
See. What else is there on this page before moving forward?

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.000
So. But yeah, I would look for like anything that is like, yeah, my profile information.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Okay. Gotcha.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Yeah.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Okay, so it feels like, you know, you talked me through what we've been doing.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000
So we went to va.gov. We went to Login, Gov. We set up an account. We came back to Va. Gov.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:44.000
And then it got things got a little bit confusing is kind of how I'm seeing it.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
So we know we've signed in with login.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Gov, we know that we can use it for VA additional tools, but we don't and we're not totally clear on how we would verify our identity if we wanted to.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Correct.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
That's all very, very helpful for me to understand.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
So, [participant 2], if you wanted to get out of this this pop up!

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Do you know what you would do next?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Let's pop up, make calls.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Yeah.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Yeah, okay, okay, cool. So that felt pretty clear. So let's go ahead and click close.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:29.000
And now can can you just confirm and tell me where we are now?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Let's see, I met my V.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
8.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:44.000
On site. I think I can't quite see in this corner, because it's because of the.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Oh, okay, that's all right.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Our video screen is there. So I'm trying to see totally what.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Yeah.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Okay? Oh, yeah. My Va might be my health. Okay, that helps.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Yeah.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Okay.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
And I know I know you mentioned at the very beginning that usually when you go on to access Va.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Benefits and healthcare and things like that.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:14.000
You start at month, and this is not my healthy vet as well.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Where is does this look like my healthy bet?

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Hmm!

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000
I know it is not. I don't think it does.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Okay.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
So we're not super sure.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
No, I'm not. Yeah. I'm not a 100% sure on it.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Yeah, yeah, that's okay.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Alright! So this has been been really helpful. We're nearly done so.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Thanks for answering so many questions already we're gonna do one more thing. And so I'm gonna just talk you through how we get to that next task so if you click just at the top of your screen somewhere in that dark, you can just click there and then it'll help us move

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:05.000
on hopefully to the next task. Yeah, there we go. Okay. So we're in imaginary world again.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:13.000
So we're on va.gov, and let's say it's a couple weeks later and you've decided to come back to Va.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Dot gov and sign. So let's click on that sign in Button.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
I'll give you a second to find that.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Let me know if it's not.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
Okay. Yup.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Yeah, perfect. So why don't we go ahead and click on that?

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Okay, so we're seeing the sign in screen again. And you know, we've set up login.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Gov. We also have this other account that we used before.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:55.000
What what are we gonna do when we see this sign in screen a couple of weeks?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Hmm!

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
I would probably sign in with my health.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Yeah, and why is that?

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
I'm just familiar with it.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Okay. And knowing that you have set up login.gov, how would you start to think about that extra sign in method that you you still have my help?

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
You bet you've got login.gov, what's the difference?

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
And how you think about those 2.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
I I I wouldn't would be more familiar with my health.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Yeah.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Vet more comfortable with that, and that would have now, if both sides are basically the same you know, I'd have to. I would have to play with login.gov, to make sure to become more familiar with it.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Yeah.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Able to navigate through it. Well, yeah, to alleviate any.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Yeah.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:12.000
You know. Headaches trying to find things easier, and if they're the same, I'm just going to assume that they might be.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Yeah.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:19.000
This are compatible. If they are, it all depends on which one I feel like going to.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Yeah, okay.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:31.000
But if one is totally, if they're both, no one has the stuff that I need, I'm gonna go to the one that I, the stuff that I need, and I can access each.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Right? Gotcha. Okay? So you know, you've set up login Gov, but you're very familiar with my healthy, that, and so it would probably take less for you to continue using my healthy vet, because it's familiar.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Correct.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:57.000
You know what to do. You're not kind of not sure Login Gov. If you started to learn how it works, and you started to sign in with it more often, you might decide to get okay.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Correct.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:07.000
That's really really helpful. So let's go ahead and click login.gov. I know we're getting a little bit like everybody gets a little tired at 50 min.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Let's yeah. So let's go ahead.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000
And now we're at the sign in page on Login Dot.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Gov, we're gonna imagine you're signing in with login.gov.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Yup!

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Okay, so we're back@va.gov, and we're seeing a different popup. And remember, this is a couple of weeks after we've set up I'm gonna give you a second to read this again.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:48:07.000
And after that we're gonna talk about what you've just read.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Okay, so, [participant 2], what is this telling you here on this screen?

00:48:42.000 --> 00:49:00.000
And this is like a another pop-up. What we had previously couple of months ago, of all cream login account that I could use it for the digital tools.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Okay.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:08.000
And if I want to go out to other different government sites, I could use that login also, no, it's just more or less learning all the different verifying the idea of myself.

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:16.000
It takes, you know, the time frame about 20 min to create, to do that, to set that up, hey?

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:28.000
She's telling me what information I will need to do that. Let's give me the option to either do it now, or can you continue later on?

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Okay, so it feels kind of familiar because you've seen that other popup previously a couple of months ago.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Okay.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
So it's not like, Oh, my gosh! What does this?

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:43.000
What's going on it almost felt like it was giving you a little more information about what we meant by other government.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Yup, Yup, that helps. Yeah.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Other government websites. Okay, yeah, yeah. Did. Do you think that this was more helpful than the previous screen that we talked about?

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Yeah.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Oh, he does! List of the government benefits, you know, or government sites.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:00.000
So like social security benefits of Federal job applications, and other government benefits, sites.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Yeah, that this is a lot more information head, a lot more information.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000
And now the previous pop-up.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Okay. Yeah. So you feel a little bit more clear about what this means.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:23.000
If you were to verify your identity, you could use it at places like social security. And it's.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, it could, hey? Clerks up the muddy water.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Okay, yeah, that's really helpful. And you also mentioned it tells you how much time it takes to complete.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:39.000
And then what you need to verify your identity. Reading this screen, what would your thoughts be?

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Do you have any hesitations about starting this verification process?

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
No, this pills it out. The time like you, said the timeframe.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
And what information you're needed, instead of just filling it I know it all. You need your driver's license.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.000
All you need is this number all you need that I'm like, oh, great!

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Right.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Yeah, okay.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:03.000
No, not where do I put that now? I gotta go grab my wallet from my partner I'm off on the car from the truck.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Yeah.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Then you're just frustrating even. Yeah.

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Yeah, no, I get that. So you like that. It told you a little bit about what to expect before you start.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
So you're not like, Oh, gosh! Now, I've got to do this and that.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Correct.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
I didn't realize that. Yeah, that's really helpful.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000
And you know, last time I'm gonna ask this.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:30.000
But if there was something on this screen that you did have a question about, what would you do in order to get help or an answer to that question?

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000
That's what I was just looking at yeah, I don't see it.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000
It's not in the popup.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:46.000
I'm more well, I probably click on, learn more.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
Okay.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:53.000
If there's a phone number, if not, if not, I close out of it. I'll find a phone number up here in the sport area.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Yeah. And let's say you did that.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:59.000
For an email, and or probably give them a call then and like, Hey, this is what I'm trying to do.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Right? Okay, if you close this, pop up. And you wanted this information you wanted to like, revisit this information.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:17.000
How would you find this information again after you click close?

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Good question.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Probably, if to try logging on in and see if it pops up again.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Okay, yeah. So you give you kinda guess a little bit about how you'd find it again.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Okay. Yeah, that's helpful. Well, you've answered all of my questions on this prototype.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000
So I'm gonna let you stop sharing your screen.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:48.000
If if you wanna come back and we can finish chatting so you'll probably see a little popup near the top of your screen.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:54.000
You saw it. Okay? And if you click, stop sharing, I think it's in red, perfect.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000
All right. So now I can just see your face perfect. Well, we've talked a lot today.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:08.000
You've answered a lot of questions out of everything that we talked about out of anything that was confusing anything that was interesting.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:17.000
What stood out to you the most.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Oh, there's no, I guess, knowing that there's.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:32.000
My question is just looking at those 4 tabs. No, that the link now is that all link into the Va dot?

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Yeah.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Gov. That's just my general question, cause I didn't never, you know, like you never shown or taught, you know, like, Hey, go to the site, have fun!

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000
I'm like, Okay, I'm trying to follow the yellow brick roll, but you know, like, get a wall.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Yeah.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000
I go off of it. Okay? Was just basically just the way I am.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:55.000
I got my health, that that's the only one I go to. Good.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:02.000
I'm familiar with it. I got find the information there now do those other 3 ones link into.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:05.000
They all play together. That's my general question.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Yeah, yeah, I can see how. It's quite confusing.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:15.000
And we've reached kind of the end of our interview, so I can stop being annoying and start answering some of these questions.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.000
What?

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:24.000
So there's so yeah, it is confusing. There's 4 different options, I think my healthy that is a common option that people have used.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:29.000
When did you set up my healthy bet? Do you remember how you were introduced?

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Probably. Last summer. Sometime. Yeah.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Did you find out about it from someone else? Or did you just decide to set it up?

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Oh, oh! From one of the Va doctors!

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Okay, right? So yeah, I think it's a common method that people use to sign in, particularly if you found out about it while you were at a Va medical center or seeing a doctor, so that there are other options that you can use to sign in and that's what those 4 different options

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
are so, all of those are basically a way that you sign in to access the Va site.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:10.000
So you can go to myheld event, but you can use login.gov to sign in, and so you'll be sent from Login.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Dot gov back to my healthy vat, and then you continue just as normal what you usually do.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:19.000
It sounds like as you go to my healthy bat.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000
You sign in with my healthy bat, and then you continue on to my healthy bet.

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:37.000
So it's not the most straightforward process which we understand, and so what we're our team is interested in is how can we make it a little bit more simple and also more secure for people to sign in to access Va benefits?

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
And services. And so Login Gov is one option.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:49.000
You saw that you'd need to set up that two-factor authentication which you know helps with security, but is also a little bit of a burden.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Sometimes, and so some of the questions I'm asking you are to help us understand where things have gotten confusing or where things could be easier to do.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000
And it was really helpful to talk through your understanding of like.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000
What's the relationship with logging? Gov to Va. Gov.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Because we know that it's not so clear so that's kind of why we were asking you those questions.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Oh, yeah.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:16.000
And I hope that makes it a little bit more clear what those 4 options are.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Yeah, awesome. It's. Is there any other questions you had for me? [participant 2]?

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:25.000
I don't want to keep asking you questions. I think it's your turn now.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:33.000
I can't really, I don't think so. If well, I did have one for the.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Like the second step step 2. So like you get the text message, or if you don't choose that, or what is there certain ones that you have to like download onto your desk or your iphone, or your app, or your android like that, too?

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Yeah, that words. That's it. Yeah, it's not a fun word to say.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000
For authentication.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Yeah. So that the authentication app that one that we talked about was a little confusing.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Right.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:14.000
So the way that it works is you would download an app on your phone, and then once you have the app downloaded on your phone, which it wasn't very clear, it didn't tell you which app to download.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Right. That's.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:26.000
You can download a couple of different ones. So a common one is called Google Authentication, or something like that, there's another one called like Off The.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Yup! Yup, I think. So. Yeah, I got like 2 of them on my phone.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
So there's a few different options. You have. Yeah, okay, yeah, exactly.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:38.000
It's just more or less. Yeah, okay. So I was just wondering which one you guys would use.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Make it for.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Yeah, so you can. So yeah, you can use any of those options, those apps.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:51.000
It's kind of up to you which one you have, so I if I if it was me setting it up, I would open my phone.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Yup!

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Whichever authentication app I already have, I would open that up, and then you would use that to scan the barcode.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:58:00.000
So it sounds like it's something you've set up before.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Yup!

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:04.000
But maybe it was a little more clear when you set it up with the other services that you were using it with.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Yeah, yeah, so that's that.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000
Yeah, so, that's my only thing. Yeah, over somewhat tech. Savvy?

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000
But not really. Okay.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Yeah, I think, that's all of us that describes every single one of us.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Some things make sense, and a lot of things don't make sense.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Right.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Well, thank you so much. I see the time, and I really appreciate our conversation today.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:32.000
It's that you're feedback is very helpful, and we're gonna continue to work through this so that we can make everything a little bit more clear before we make any changes.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000
I do want to reassure you that the way that you're signing in right now like you don't need to change any of that.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000
You can continue as you are. All of the changes that we're talking about.

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:46.000
These are not happening yet, or at all are not happening yet, or at all, or in this exact way.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:51.000
So continue as you are, and don't worry about signing in with my healthy bat, and all of that.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Okay.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:57.000
The last thing to say is the folks who are contacting you to set up the interview.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000
They're gonna be the ones who are paying you for the interview.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:03.000
So if you have any questions about that, you just let them know and I think that's everything.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Okay.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Do you have any other questions?

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.000
No, I don't think so.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Awesome. Well, thank you so much. It was really great to meet you.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Yeah, same here, thanks. Guys, have a good day.

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Bye, you too!
