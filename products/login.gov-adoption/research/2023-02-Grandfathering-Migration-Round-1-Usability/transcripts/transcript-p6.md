> I've started recording I'd like to confirm. Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000

> Yeah.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000

> Great. I'd like to start by learning a little bit more about your experience with the VA. And some of our online services. How long have you been a Veteran?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000

> I've been a Veteran now... I think it's 38 years of service.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000

> Wow! That's incredible. How often do you go online to access and management your VA benefits and healthcare?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000

> At least, maybe once or twice a month, I go to the VA. I use the site to input my knowledge, go in and check MHV. I go in there to communicate with my primary physician about twice a month.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000

> Yeah, okay, that's great. Do you remember the last time you signed into the VA online?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000

> I was getting ready to sign in. I went in yesterday with my computer. About 2 weeks ago I had to go in and put some money in.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:27.000

> Okay, so yesterday you we're trying to put in some mileage to get reimbursed.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000

> Yes, and the only thing the only thing about that â€“ when you go in and put your mileage in. You have issues with putting your totals in.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000

> Okay. Yeah. How do you sign into VA?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000

> I use MHV. The updated version. A new version.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000

> When you say the updated version? Do you mean premium?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000

> Yeah. Premium. Yes. Yes, it's premium.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000

> Yeah, okay.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000

> A locked in my information. So it's pretty easy when I go in. When I get decide to, it just prompts me, and then pulls up my data, and I go in.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000

> That's great. Great. So how does it usually work when you sign into VA.gov? What do you do first?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000

*** watch video from here ***

> First I got to decide my house there then it is so now I think. Give me a selection of which one to go into.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Yeah.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Accoon.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And when I click on that, if some sometimes they send me a verification confirmation call sometime I get that.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Now I put that, and I validate. I put that in.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Did I go through them to the site?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Okay, great. Is there anything else you want to share with me about signing in before we move on?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Penny is no issue with signing is breed.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Great, that's good to hear. So next I'd like to share some ideas with you.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So we can get your feedback in a minute. I'm going to send you a link to a prototype.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
I mentioned earlier that a prototype is like a pretend version of an email or a website it's going to look similar.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
But it won't work as you might expect, because it's not a real email or a website.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Okay.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Okay, I'm gonna send that to you in the chat, just copying it.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And I put the link in the chat.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I have!

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Let me know, once you open that.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And are you familiar with sharing your screen in zoom?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Not to live with that.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:15.000
That's okay. I can walk you through it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Let me know, once you have that link open and okay. Great.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I have the leg open.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So come back to zoom, and at the bottom of the zoom there should be.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I'm oh, sure!

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Come back to. Okay. I mean, I'm finding. Actually, I think the screen.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
You do? Okay? Yeah. That green button that says, share screen.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I see the little screen with a Zoom Meeting. Then it got zoom on other side.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Okay.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I hit the new Z down to the bottom of the computer.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Yeah. Yeah. So that's how you can come back to zoom.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Okay.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
You want me to come back to it?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Yes.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Okay.

The green button. I don't see a green butt.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Where you said the green blend is that?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Hello!

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Yeah, the so at the bottom, at the bottom, where you see chat, and you might say, mute, there's an icon of a microphone.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I don't see a microphone. I don't see a microphone.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Do you agree? But right now I didn't see that before. Okay.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
You found it.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Okay.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Thanks. Sarah. Okay.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Great. And now I'm looking at your screen.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Okay.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And I'd like to start bye. Imagine that you've just received this email from the Va. And I'm gonna ask you to take a second to read this closely. And when you're finished, I'd like you to summarize what you've read.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Okay.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Okay. That didn't mean that the the current system that they had would be discontinued soon, and you'll be able to sign up for the premium, which would, when you are both have the choice to go to the premium login account.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
You don't want to do any variation.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
In the future.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Okay, do you have any questions? After reading this email?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
No, I think I received something like this. I'm problem, though.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Yeah. So this is him.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
When I switched over when I switched over to Premium.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Gotcha!

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:51.000
What is this email asking you to do next?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But I gather for me to argue. He told me I could do it I didn't have a certain time to do it.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I could do it anytime. I did mine right away.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Can you say more about that?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I see it when I received this minimal. I don't think it gave me an I don't see a time when it says that I just did.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Gotcha!

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Mine told me to do it. I just did mine at my convenience.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Yeah. So it's not telling you when you have to do it.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Gotcha!

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Yeah, you could do it anytime. So I just did mine.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I did mine as a couple of times. I'm going back in the whole way. Then I change that.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Just to test it, to see how it works.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So you've done something like this before.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Yes.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Okay in this scenario. Would you be interested in setting up a login Gov account right now?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Okay, so.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
You mean set up a new one?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Set up a login account.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So, okay, and how do I go about doing that?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Go to Va dot global account.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
How do you think you would? You think?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I I would probably go to the Va. Good to create an account.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Okay, before you click on that I have a few more questions.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Do you have any hesitations about setting up a login account?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Yeah, of course, we are when I do go in and set up account.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:38.000
I have all the time in one to do it. So if I'm if I take my time and make an error, I don't mess anything up.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Good in a timeframe. I have be a little nervous about doing it.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Okay.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
But I'm doing it on my own. You I have all the time, you know, to play around with.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000
If I needed. Come out and try to get in later.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Okay, yeah. Oh, why do you think the Va is recommending that you set up a login account?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:17.000
I guess they try to make everybody. If most of you are saying you get all the building on the same page.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And I guess what it change of technology in the future.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Probably be fast.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Okay, yeah. If you had a question about anything that you read here, what would you do?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I would probably call try to most time on the side.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
The other little icon for support.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Then they try to find that phone, and we either do it through the do it through the website and go to support.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Yeah.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
That's what I get to do. I try to get support on how to do, have to walk me through the procedure.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Okay, how would you get support?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Then it be a telephone them. I go to that website.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Try to get your phone number to our support. Awesome. Many. Va.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Okay.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Administration, hey? I didn't get me any support.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Okay, thanks for that. Let's go ahead and click that button.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Okay.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Alright!

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Is this what you expected to see after the email?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Yes, I give me from that some login instruction. Yes.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Okay. Can you tell me what you would do next?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I would go to my health. Then.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Yeah, that's the one that you're that you usually use.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Okay.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Why are you? I get we should all have it so.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Great.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I figured what I'm familiar with. I don't want off too much that's why I say, stick with my husband, that's the one I'm both using.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Most of them have any kind of thing to do with your mind, cause most.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I'm going my health bed and do almost anything I wanna do.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Yeah. Great. Would you ever sign in using Ds log on?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I think I might have did it in the past long time ago.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Yeah.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Okay, yeah. But that's not when they use anymore. Okay, let's pretend that that you are still using your Ds log on.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:42.000
So today we're going to sign in with Ds Logon. So go ahead and click that.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Okay.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And let's pretend that you entered in your username and password, so you can go ahead and click log on.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Okay? And before we read this in detail, can you describe to me what we're looking at?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
You've got to navigate away from Va.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And read that way to Login you can continue to login they're taking to continue and login to dog in dot good.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Dot good be a joy!

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:30.000
So it's given you a choice. Okay? And why do you think that this appeared on your screen?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
So he won't stay with a secure sight. You might wanna stay in with.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Okay.

Okay, do you have any questions? After coming to this page?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:16:05.000
That would. No, I wouldn't have an equation. I would just continue to go forward with it with the prompts.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Bye!

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Okay. And what do you expect? What happened next? If if you continued with the prompts?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
He'll probably take you to a low end set.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Where, where you need your free, to the fact that you're looking for your you'll get the screenshots.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000

And.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000
And once they send the code I would see again this in the spring.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:27.000
You plump the screen up that one pass security code out go in and type in the code exactly what they sent me on.

Okay? And before we click anything, what do you expect to happen when you click a green, continue?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Hmm! Probably go into the account.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000

Okay.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
If there's an issue on this page, what would you do?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
Code, take support with Va.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
And what does this screen mean to you?

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Confirming that you have signed in with the login login.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Before we talk about this screen I'd like to just reflect a little bit about what just happened in your own words.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
Can you tell me what you just did?

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Full process.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Yes.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Yeah, we could deal with want me through the process of setting up an account for a login not good.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:14.000
That it did verification need a.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And also gave the authentication for how they how they would check these tests to make sure that the right person signed into the account. So when they hit your account that you have they have to get verification from you, and send you a code to put in in order to go into your account it was a login prophecy.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Including security factor.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Okay.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000
And where are we now?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
You on the site. 9. Say you are logged in?

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:55.000
You have signed in with Login dot good.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
And I guess you can go into fact 9. Go in my Va.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Or my hill for any one of those admin will go check on them and go in.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Have access to the window side.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Okay. And what is the screen trying to tell you?

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Okay.

To check, to enter in your mileage.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Do you have any concerns about your ability to do that task?

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Now!

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000
No, I don't think I have any question back you know most of the meeting when I go in.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:56.000
It is the process of reading. Touch and go as you go along and follow the instruction.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:00.000
Okay, yeah, that makes sense.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
I don't like doing it, but you know, putting it in, I used to like it better when I just turn it into the Va.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:12.000
At at the Ca facilities. But it's okay.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Oh, okay, you preferred it when you could do it in person.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
This would not drop it off when I booked it. See, my dot!

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
You had dropped my seat off the name, and they put it in.

That's what you said to me is a issue with attaching the tolls and all that.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Sure!

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
And not because of the side, is still probably because my knowledge of the site of being able to use the computer.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Okay.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:45.000

I Robin is going in, and I've been in for a while.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:46.000
I would go into va.gov hit down to login if you don't log in, we're not going to log in.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And get it going to prompt me up with those different side like.

Yeah.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Okay, well, today, imagine after you've set up that login Gov account, imagine that that you still use your Ds login account.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
And you set up this this new login dot of account.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:50.000

Can you describe to me what you're looking at now?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Is already created. Account. Now.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Looking at the screen with it, verified your login login.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:41.000
Goup account. What a youth I have! A Va.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:48.000
And 80, got 20Â min to wait. Yeah, your phone name, or whatever it's so good.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000
And then why are you gonna do the verify? We got 20Â min to input all that information.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000
We did load that we get off that.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:05.000
That's the verification we have to verify that it's you and no one else went into your account.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000
Okay.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
And why do you think this appeared on your screen?

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Security.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Okay, can you say more about that?

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Yeah, keep it to what I have on boarding and getting your account from into your medical, any any personal information?

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000
All your information is, once you get in all your information.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Okay.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000
I'm getting to give you a second to read this a little more closely, and when you're finished I'd like you to summarize.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Okay.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Okay, they give you options in here. You can either go in, get access to all the Va digital tools and manage healthcare benefits.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
You wanna use other government web site. We need to go into validate.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
You have to verify your identity. Oh, that's something new.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:45.000
I know you can go and look at the Social security benefits and Federal job application.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
You have options.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Yeah, okay, do you have any?

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
You got a line that what's the learning more about verifying you in general?

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Oh, you click on that link any additional information?

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Great. Do you have any initial questions? After reading this?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
No, I?

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Think that accounted on dog. I thought going to use it.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Okay. Would you be interested in upgrading your account?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Into the premium@thelogin.gov.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Log, in.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
If you saw this? Yeah, yeah.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Yeah, it's sound like something I would want to do.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Okay. Why do you think the Va. Is recommending that you upgrade your login account?

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Sounds like a one stop shopping. You can go to other sites and stuff and feel good.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
They haven't got to the security side, and all that.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:09.000
You can do it all through. login.gov.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Yeah, so it's.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Under one umbrella.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Yeah.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:25.000
But now you got social security. Got opm. Got all different kind of facts.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
So it sounds like.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Now, there's something that you guys plan on doing in a few.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Can can you say more about that?

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Is this? Is this always in this a distance? So you guys don't play alone. This is something you're working on.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Doing is already been the.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Hello! Again.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Yeah, so this there.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.000
There's also a way for you to login is already one of the ways to login to via.com.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Okay. Oh, okay.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Yeah. So can you say a little bit more about using this in in other places?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Lack of using, is it? When I'm understanding that you need to go in?

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Look at Job. African and you're going in for. Not that I'm looking for job vacation, looking for social security.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
You can go through that login dot good which I make.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000
We got, I think, is very convenient.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Okay.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
For me it would be.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Okay? So it sounds like login. Gov is how you can access these other websites.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Hey? Love the government, its website? Yeah, I like their products.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Okay.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
I gotta do my manage the day I'm gonna go in and play around with it.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Okay.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:14.000
If you choose not to upgrade your login account, what do you think will happen?

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
I think eventually, guys, I'm not. I don't.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Quick main thing to happen, because if the side I have, I probably would still do to go in.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:33.000
But assume, if you are dealing with technology change, you might be a problem getting in.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Can can you say that again?

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:42.000
I said. If you don't change, I guess with the changing technology, it will make it kind of difficult for you to be able to get into the site.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Yeah. Okay. So if anything was changed.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000
So we're staying in 2 with technology, you can.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Probably want to change it, upgrade and change today.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Yeah, okay.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
If you had a question.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Once you log in, but you can log in. You can use login.gov and still keep the same one I have like going in.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.000
My, he's a premium, right? You can have both right.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Okay.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Yes, yeah, you can have multiple ways to log in.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Yeah, yeah, he'd want to keep us up. My security blanket.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
I get used to the site.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Okay.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:32.000
If you had a question about anything on this screen, what would you do?

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:38.000
I would call the port.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Okay.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Great.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:51.000
So we covered a lot today. And I'd like to spend a couple of minutes now just reflecting before we wrap up.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Can you summarize what it is that you did today as you click through this prototype?

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Overview of Va a login dot good.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000
The benefits. How are you sign in? How you get verification?

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Indicate new accounts.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:21.000
And some of the features of the account.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:27.000
And if you have any issues who to contact.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Yeah. An assistant.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:44.000
And walk through the process, verifying your account, validate in your account.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Yeah.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Okay.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Out of everything that you did today and looked at. Is there anything that sticks out to you?

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Thanks that to me is the part of the leg of this screen right here, where you can go into or manage other government benefits and service like social security and Federal job updates.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
I didn't know. You can do all that to that fact.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Do it, going through?

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Is there anything else we could do to make it easier for you to set up a login account to use that the Va.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:44.000
No, what you could do I'm not sure if everyone yes, I have a housing and session.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Have a Thursday with a lot of other Va.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000
A lot of their bedrooms and I don't think a lot of them are familiar with this are Va.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Low login dot go but most of them is like I am using that cause.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:07.000
Then. So if you, if they could put something out to all the veteran, let them know this will.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Some of the pro. Some of the.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Very. You're using login login, dot go with.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
That would be a help.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Okay.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Great. Well, thank you. Those are all the questions that I have for you today.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Do you have any questions for me?

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Oh, well, thanks a lot. I opened my eyes a lot too.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.000
So being dot good, but what it could do with it to give some of the advantages that use it.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Yeah, yeah, I want to clarify that. So login.gov is, is is a credential is is a way to login.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Via.gov. So just like you use my healthy that to log in you can use login.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Okay.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Gov. So to log in, to Va. Gov. And you can use that same login that you create elsewhere on other government websites.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Okay.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:15.000
So it's not that you can go to login.gov to access those websites you can go to those websites and use your login username and password on those sites.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Does that make sense?

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Okay, make sense. Thank you.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Okay, yeah, yeah, I just wanted to clarify that with you.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000
I really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Your feedback is so helpful, as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really, before we go.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
I wanna make sure it's clear that everything we did today is not real.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000
So you haven't actually set up a logging. Doc Gov.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Account or changed the way that you sign into via you can continue logging in with my healthy, that, as you normally and thank you.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Lastly, Perry, Jan, I think we'll be sending a thank you.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Note with a little blurb, so you can pass along to other veterans, you may know, to provide them with a chance to participate in future research studies.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000
And now also be in touch about payment as well.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Thank you. You have a nice day. I'm sorry about the difficult.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
At the beginning of the video.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Oh, not at all technical difficulties are just all part of it.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
No problem.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Alright, thank you, and have a nice one.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Thank you so much. You have a great day.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Take care bye, bye!

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Bye, take
