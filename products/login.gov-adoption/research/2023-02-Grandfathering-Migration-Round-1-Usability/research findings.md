## Research goals

The key goals of this study were to:

* Review whether Veterans can migrate their accounts from DS Logon to Login.gov (IAL1) without issue.
* Review whether Veterans understand the type of account they've set up and its limitations.
* Review whether Veterans know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.

## Research questions

Review whether Veterans can migrate their accounts from DS Logon to Login.gov (IAL1) without issue:

* Are Veterans motivated to set up a Login.gov account when initially prompted, why or why not?
* Are Veterans more or less motivated when prompted via email or via a (surprise) modal after sign-in?
* How confident do Veterans feel about their ability to set up a Login.gov account when initially prompted?
* Can Veterans successfully initiate the account setup flow?
* Can Veterans successfully create their account, including verifying their email address and setting up multi-factor authentication?
* Can Veterans successfully return back to the VA after setting up their account?
* Do Veterans understand they are now signed into Login.gov?
* Do Veterans have concerns about their data or information now that they use a different sign in method?
* Do Veterans have concerns about their ability to continue accessing VA services, now that they have a new login method?

Review whether Veterans understand what type of account they have set up with Login.gov and its limitations:

* Do Veterans understand why they're being asked to set up a Login.gov account?
* Do Veterans understand the type of Login.gov account they are being asked to set up?
* Do Veterans understand that they should now stop using DS Logon and use Login.gov to sign in moving forward?
* Are Veterans motivated to upgrade to an IAL2 Login.gov account at a later date, why or why not?

Review whether Veterans know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.

* What will Veterans do first if they encounter an issue?
* Do Veterans know where or how to get help if they encounter an issue?

## Methodology

This usability study was conducted remotely on Zoom. We tested on desktop. 2 participants used tablets instead.

We tested two prototypes. In half the sessions, we tested Prototype #1 and in the other half we tested Prototype #2. Both flows are similar but start differently:

* Prototype #1: After signing in to VA.gov, a modal pops up asking Veteran to set up a Login.gov account.
* Prototype #2: Veteran receives an email asking them to sign in to VA.gov to start Login.gov account set up.

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

All participants:
* Must be Veterans
* Must have a computer and be willing to complete their sessions on this device (Note: In subsequent rounds, we will include and favour mobile testing)
* Must be willing to share a web browser window on their computer
* Must have a working microphone on their computer
* Must have Zoom downloaded to their computer prior to the session and know how to share their screen
* Must have signed into a VA application (including VA.gov, My HealtheVet or eBenefits) in the last 6 months
* Must use DS Logon (as their credential service provider) to sign in to the VA. If Veterans aren’t sure what this means or what they use, this can be confirmed by asking them to sign into VA.gov and confirming how they logged in.

At least 13 participants:
* Must not have a Login.gov or ID.me account set up.

At most 2 participants:
* Must have a Login.gov account set up, but not use it to sign in to the VA. For example, they use Login.gov to sign in to TSA Pre-check or USAJobs, but, when they sign in to VA.gov, they use DS Logon.

Demographic goals:
* At least 50% of people must be over 55
* At least 50% of people must have an identified cognitive disability
* At least 30% of people must identify as Black, Hispanic, or Native
* At least 30% of people must be without a degree or professional certificate
* At least 30% of people must live in a rural or remote area
* At least 20% of people must identify as other than male
* At least 20% of people must be non-native English speakers
* At least 20% of people must identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender

We talked to 10 participants. More information about the participants recruited for this study is in the [VA Recruitment Checker for Equality](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit#gid=589451186).

### Underserved groups we haven’t talked to

This research does not include the perspectives of the following marginalized Veteran groups:
Asian Veterans
LGBTQ+ Veterans

We weren't given data on whether participants were other than honorably discharged, of immigrant origin, or expats (living abroad).

We tested a desktop-first prototype, with the aim to test a mobile-first prototype in our next round of research. We did not aim to recruit AT users, with the aim to test a coded prototype with AT users in a subsequent round of research.
