## Research goals

The key goals of this study are to:

* Review whether Veterans can migrate their accounts from DS Logon to Login.gov (IAL1) without issue.
* Review whether Veterans understand the type of account they've set up and its limitations.
* Review whether Veterans know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.

## Research questions

Review whether Veterans can migrate their accounts from DS Logon to Login.gov (IAL1) without issue:

* Are Veterans motivated to set up a Login.gov account when initially prompted, why or why not?
* Are Veterans more or less motivated when prompted via email or via a (surprise) modal after sign-in?
* How confident do Veterans feel about their ability to set up a Login.gov account when initially prompted?
* Can Veterans successfully initiate the account setup flow?
* Can Veterans successfully create their account, including verifying their email address and setting up multi-factor authentication?
* Can Veterans successfully return back to the VA after setting up their account?
* Do Veterans understand they are now signed into Login.gov?
* Do Veterans have concerns about their data or information now that they use a different sign in method?
* Do Veterans have concerns about their ability to continue accessing VA services, now that they have a new login method?

Review whether Veterans understand what type of account they have set up with Login.gov and its limitations:

* Do Veterans understand why they're being asked to set up a Login.gov account?
* Do Veterans understand the type of Login.gov account they are being asked to set up?
* Do Veterans understand that they should now stop using DS Logon and use Login.gov to sign in moving forward?
* Are Veterans motivated to upgrade to an IAL2 Login.gov account at a later date, why or why not?

Review whether Veterans know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.

* What will Veterans do first if they encounter an issue?
* Do Veterans know where or how to get help if they encounter an issue?

## Methodology

This usability study will be conducted remotely on Zoom. We will test on desktop.

We will test two prototypes. In half the sessions, we'll test Prototype #1 and in the other half we'll test Prototype #2. Both flows are nearly identical, but each has an alternative start:

Prototype #1: After signing in to VA.gov, a modal pops up asking Veteran to set up a Login.gov account.
Prototype #2: Veteran receives an email asking them to sign in to VA.gov to start Login.gov account set up.
