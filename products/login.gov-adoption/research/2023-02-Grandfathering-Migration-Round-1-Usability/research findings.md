## Research goals

The key goals of this study were to:

* Review whether Veterans can migrate their accounts from DS Logon to Login.gov (IAL1) without issue.
* Review whether Veterans understand the type of account they've set up and its limitations.
* Review whether Veterans know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.

## Research questions

Review whether Veterans can migrate their accounts from DS Logon to Login.gov (IAL1) without issue:

* Are Veterans motivated to set up a Login.gov account when initially prompted, why or why not?
* Are Veterans more or less motivated when prompted via email or via a (surprise) modal after sign-in?
* How confident do Veterans feel about their ability to set up a Login.gov account when initially prompted?
* Can Veterans successfully initiate the account setup flow?
* Can Veterans successfully create their account, including verifying their email address and setting up multi-factor authentication?
* Can Veterans successfully return back to the VA after setting up their account?
* Do Veterans understand they are now signed into Login.gov?
* Do Veterans have concerns about their data or information now that they use a different sign in method?
* Do Veterans have concerns about their ability to continue accessing VA services, now that they have a new login method?

Review whether Veterans understand what type of account they have set up with Login.gov and its limitations:

* Do Veterans understand why they're being asked to set up a Login.gov account?
* Do Veterans understand the type of Login.gov account they are being asked to set up?
* Do Veterans understand that they should now stop using DS Logon and use Login.gov to sign in moving forward?
* Are Veterans motivated to upgrade to an IAL2 Login.gov account at a later date, why or why not?

Review whether Veterans know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.

* What will Veterans do first if they encounter an issue?
* Do Veterans know where or how to get help if they encounter an issue?

## Methodology

This usability study was conducted remotely on Zoom. We tested on desktop. 2 participants used tablets instead.

We tested two prototypes. In half the sessions, we tested Prototype #1 and in the other half we tested Prototype #2. Both flows are similar but start differently:

* Prototype #1: After signing in to VA.gov, a modal pops up asking Veteran to set up a Login.gov account.
* Prototype #2: Veteran receives an email asking them to sign in to VA.gov to start Login.gov account set up.

## Hypotheses and conclusions

|Hypotheses|Concusions|
|:--|:--|
|Veterans will be motivated to set up a Login.gov account if they understand they will no longer be able to use DS Logon at some point in the future.|Likely True|
|Veterans who receive an email will be more motivated to set up a Login.gov account than those who see a modal pop-up; because they won't be interrupted while completing another VA task.|Likely True|
|Veterans will be able to set up an IAL1 Login.gov account, which is less risky and burdensome than setting up an IAL2 Login.gov account.|Likely True|
|Most Veterans will be able to set up one multi-factor authentication method without issue.|Likely True|
|Most Veterans will choose to set up text or voice message as their multi-factor authentication method.|Definitely True|
|Veterans will be motivated to continue to use their Login.gov account moving forward if they understand they should stop using their DS Logon account.|Likely True|
|Veterans will be motivated to upgrade to an IAL2 account through identity proofing if they understand what an IAL2 account will let them do (access other government websites).|Likely True|
|Veterans will decide and be able to navigate to contact information on the Login.gov or VA.gov websites if they encounter an issue during account creation.|Definitely True|

## Key findings

1. Most Veterans are motivated to set up a Login.gov account because they’re concerned about losing access to their benefits and healthcare.
2. Veterans are likely to ignore messaging about migrating to Login.gov if it comes at the wrong time, on the wrong device, or without additional context and information for those who need it.
3. Veterans didn’t recognize a relationship between their verified DS Logon account and their ability to create a Login.gov without identity verifying right away.
4. Veterans are unfamiliar with the term ‘VA Digital Tools’ which causes confusion and demotivates them, because they’re not sure what they’re losing or gaining access to.
5. Not understanding the difference between authentication and verification makes it difficult to know the limitations of an unverified Login.gov account, and how verification works.
6. Veterans prefer when they’re giving more information about the account, what to expect, and where to get help from VA.

## Additional insights

1. Many Veterans benefit from password managers, whether they’re using a password manager application or an in-browser password manager that auto fills their details for them.

2. Veterans found it straightforward to close the modal and most Veterans understood that was all they needed to do in order to navigate to another task they would like to complete on VA.gov.

3. Most Veterans will choose to set up SMS, and are familiar with it. We found this during discovery research and it’s further confirmed by data from Login.gov.

4. Most Veterans will not choose to set up a backup multi-factor authentication method. Those that would choose to set up a backup method tend to have experience with losing their phone, or understand there might be circumstances when they’re unable to access one method.

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

All participants:
* Must be Veterans
* Must have a computer and be willing to complete their sessions on this device (Note: In subsequent rounds, we will include and favour mobile testing)
* Must be willing to share a web browser window on their computer
* Must have a working microphone on their computer
* Must have Zoom downloaded to their computer prior to the session and know how to share their screen
* Must have signed into a VA application (including VA.gov, My HealtheVet or eBenefits) in the last 6 months
* Must use DS Logon (as their credential service provider) to sign in to the VA. If Veterans aren’t sure what this means or what they use, this can be confirmed by asking them to sign into VA.gov and confirming how they logged in.

At least 13 participants:
* Must not have a Login.gov or ID.me account set up.

At most 2 participants:
* Must have a Login.gov account set up, but not use it to sign in to the VA. For example, they use Login.gov to sign in to TSA Pre-check or USAJobs, but, when they sign in to VA.gov, they use DS Logon.

Demographic goals:
* At least 50% of people must be over 55
* At least 50% of people must have an identified cognitive disability
* At least 30% of people must identify as Black, Hispanic, or Native

### Underserved groups we haven’t talked to

This research does not include the perspectives of the following marginalized Veteran groups:
Asian Veterans
LGBTQ+ Veterans

We weren't given data on whether participants were other than honorably discharged, of immigrant origin, or expats (living abroad).

We tested a desktop-first prototype, with the aim to test a mobile-first prototype in our next round of research. We did not aim to recruit AT users, with the aim to test a coded prototype with AT users in a subsequent round of research.
