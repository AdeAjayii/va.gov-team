# Research Plan: Organic Adoption Messaging (Usability)
*Login.gov Adoption Team, Organic Adoption, March 2023*

Last updated by @tygindraux: March 14, 2023

## Background

There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These sign in options don't all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. During [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/discovery/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research), we defined different pathways for the migration.

This initiative focuses on one migration pathway: the organic adoption of Login.gov. In this case, we're encouraging Veterans to adopt Login.gov as their primary credential, however we're not providing any specific binding or inheriting of identity data. Essentially, we're encouraging Veterans to set up a Login.gov from scratch. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/login.gov) has more details on this product.

This study is part of a staged rollout plan. The [research overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research) has more details on what is upcoming and related.

### Research this builds on

* [2022-10-Research-LoginGovFieldResearch #185](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/185)
* [2022-07 MHV transition to Login.gov as a single sign-on #157](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/157)
* [2022-07 Login Self-Service Tool #156](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/156)
* [2022-03 Sign-In Accessibility #93](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/issues/93)

### OCTO Objectives 

* Veterans can manage their health services online.
* Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov.

### Veteran Journey

Signing to securely access VA services can happen at any stage in the [Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). With this migration pathway, however, we're particularly focused on the stages that occur later on in the journey. Other migration initiatives will focus on reaching Veterans who are just getting out and starting up, aiming to ensure Veterans proactively set up Login.gov (instead of another credential service provider) from the start.

This initiative is focused on Veterans who have set up a DS Logon account already. In order for Veterans to not lose access to their information and benefits when DS Logon is sunset by the VA, we need to ensure there is a clear and technically-feasible pathway for their migration.

These stages include:
* Taking care of myself
* Putting down roots
* Retiring
* Aging

## Research Goals	

The key goals of this study are to:

* Review whether Veterans are motivated to set up a Login.gov account based on messaging
* Review whether Veterans understand what we're asking them to do and why

### Outcome

This research will validate and refine content that encourages a Veteran to set up a Login.gov from scratch (or without any migration of data from previous legacy credentials). We will aim to find solutions to any issues that are surfaced through testing.

This research will inform a staged rollout plan.

### Research questions

Review whether Veterans are motivated to set up a Login.gov account based on messaging

* Are Veterans motivated to set up a Login.gov account when prompted, why or why not?
* How confident do Veterans feel about their ability to set up a Login.gov account when prompted?
* Do Veterans have concerns about setting up a Login.gov account?
* Do Vetetans have concerns about their ability to continue accessing VA services if they do or don't set up Login.gov?

Review whether Veterans understand what we're asking them to do and why

* Do Veterans understand why they're being asked to set up a Login.gov account?
* Do Veterans understand that they should now stop using other credentials and use Login.gov to sign in moving forward?

### Hypotheses

These hypotheses still need to be updated.

* Veterans will be motivated to set up a Login.gov account if they understand they will no longer be able to use DS Logon at some point in the future.
* Veterans will be motivated to continue to use their Login.gov account moving forward if they understand they should stop using their DS Logon account.

## Methodology
This usability study will be conducted remotely on Zoom. We will test on desktop or mobile.

## Recruitment	

Before defining our recruitment strategy, we reviewed:
* [Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md)
* [Inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md)
* [Introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md)
* [Recruitment checker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing)

### Recruitment approach

We will use Perigean to recruit Veterans for this moderated study. We haven't submitted a Recruitment Request yet.

### Recruitment criteria

We need to recruit 10 Veterans for this study in order to achieve 7 completed sessions.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

All participants:
* Must be Veterans
* Must have a computer and be willing to complete their sessions on this device (Note: In subsequent rounds, we will include and favour mobile testing)
* Must be willing to share a web browser window on their computer
* Must have a working microphone on their computer
* Must have Zoom downloaded to their computer prior to the session and know how to share their screen
* Must have signed into a VA application (including VA.gov, My HealtheVet or eBenefits) in the last 6 months
* Must use DS Logon (as their credential service provider) to sign in to the VA. If Veterans aren’t sure what this means or what they use, this can be confirmed by asking them to sign into VA.gov and confirming how they logged in.
* Must not have a Login.gov or ID.me account set up.

Demographic goals:
* At least 50% of people must be over 55
* At least 50% of people must have an identified cognitive disability
