# About this research

## Study
(This study hasn't started, so it hasn't been added to the [Research Repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository) yet).

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These sign in options don't all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. During [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/discovery/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research), we defined different pathways for the migration.

This initiative focuses on one migration pathway: the organic adoption of Login.gov. In this case, we're encouraging Veterans to adopt Login.gov as their primary credential, however we're not providing any specific binding or inheriting of identity data. Essentially, we're encouraging Veterans to set up a Login.gov from scratch. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/login.gov) has more details on this product.

This study is part of a staged rollout plan and relates to other organic adoption research we will do. The [research overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research) has more details on what is upcoming.

## Research Goals

- Understand whether Veterans are motivated to set up a Login.gov account based on messaging
- Review whether Veterans understand what we're asking them to do and why

## Date
This research will likely take place in March-April 2023.
