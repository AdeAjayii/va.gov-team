# About this research

## Study
(This study hasn't started, so it hasn't been added to the [Research Repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository) yet).

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These sign in options don't all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. During [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/discovery/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research), we defined different pathways for the migration.

This initiative focuses on one migration pathway: the organic adoption of Login.gov. In this case, we're encouraging Veterans to adopt Login.gov as their primary credential, however we're not providing any specific binding or inheriting of identity data. Essentially, we're encouraging Veterans to set up a Login.gov account from scratch. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/login.gov) has more details on this product.

This study is part of a staged rollout plan. The [research overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research) has more details on what is upcoming and related.

We're interested in testing this in mobile, because it's an identified gap (and commonly used for VA applications) and we hypothesize the length of the content could be a problem on mobile.

This research will be conducted in partnership with the Core Identity team. They will lead this study. Their [documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity/Research/2023-04%20Organic%20LIG%20Adoption) includes more details.

## Research Goals

- Review whether Veterans are motivated to set up a Login.gov account based on messaging
- Review whether Veterans understand what we're asking them to do and why

## Date
This research will take place in April 2023.
