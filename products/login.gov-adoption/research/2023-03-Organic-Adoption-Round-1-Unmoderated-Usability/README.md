# About this research

## Study
(This study hasn't started, so it hasn't been added to the [Research Repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository) yet).

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These sign in options don't all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. During [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/discovery/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research), we defined different pathways for the migration.

This initiative focuses on one migration pathway: the organic adoption of Login.gov. In this case, we're encouraging Veterans to adopt Login.gov as their primary credential, however we're not providing any specific binding or inheriting of identity data. We're essentially encouraging Veterans to set up an account from scratch, including identity verification. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/login.gov) has more details on this product.

This study is part of a [staged rollout plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X5A69Jqx4xQyJje3Cwbp8e_aOH7EYS2rjmkWe6_kHiA/edit#heading=h.g5j35d7r1ip0)  which will start with Stage A: Canary, where we will run a test with a small Veteran population to ensure any obvious bugs and edge cases are found in production.

## Research Goals
These research goals still need to be agreed upon. They are based on this [staged rollout plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X5A69Jqx4xQyJje3Cwbp8e_aOH7EYS2rjmkWe6_kHiA/edit#heading=h.g5j35d7r1ip0).

- Review whether Veterans need help through account setup and where they go for support
- Review which issues Veterans face during IAL2 account setup
- Review whether Veterans who use screen readers can complete IAL2 account setup

## Date
This research will likely take place in March 2023.
