# About this research

## Study
(This study hasn't started, so it hasn't been added to the [Research Repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository) yet).

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These sign in options don't all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. During [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/discovery/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research), we defined different pathways for the migration.

This initiative focuses on one migration pathway: organic adoption of Login.gov. In this case, we're encouraging Veterans to adopt Login.gov as their primary credential, however we're not providing any specific binding or inheriting of identity data. The [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/login.gov) has more details on this product.

We will run an unmoderated usability test to review the effectiveness and usability of content which encourages the Veteran to set up a Login.gov account. This would take place before running a live test in production. The [research overview](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research) has more details on what is upcoming.

## Research Goals
We still need to write and agree on research goals for this future study.

## Date
This research will likely take place in March-April 2023.
