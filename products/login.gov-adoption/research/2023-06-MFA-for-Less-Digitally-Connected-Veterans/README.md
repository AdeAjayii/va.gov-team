# About this research

## Study
(This study hasn't started, so it hasn't been added to the [Research Repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository) yet).

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These sign in options don't all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/legacy%20CSP%20migrations) has more details on this product.

In order to set up a Login.gov account, whether a Veteran is migrating to Login.gov from a legacy credential or setting up a Login.gov organically, a Veteran will be required to set up MFA. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/mfa%20security%20keys%20pilot) has more details on this product.

This research will build on [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/discovery/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research) help inform recommendations related to MFA set up and use.

## Research Goals
* Identify accessibility issues for blind and low vision Veterans who use assistive technology (AT) to sign in and access VA services.
* Review whether Veterans can migrate their accounts from DS Logon to Login.gov (IAL1) without issue.
* Review whether Veterans understand the type of account they've set up and its limitations.
* Review whether Veterans know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.

## Date
This research will likely take place in April 2023.
