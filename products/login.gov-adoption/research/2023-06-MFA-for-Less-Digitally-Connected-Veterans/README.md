# About this research

## Study
(This study hasn't started, so it hasn't been added to the [Research Repository](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository) yet).

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These sign in options don't all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/legacy%20CSP%20migrations) has more details on this product.

In order to set up a Login.gov account, a Veteran will be required to set up multi-factor authentication (MFA). This can cause issues for user's who aren't familiar with MFA set up and use. This [product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/mfa%20security%20keys%20pilot) has more details on this product.

Taking this a step further, there is a particular risk here for Veterans who have limited connectivity and/or limited access to different devices. One hypotheses that the VA would like to explore is whether security keys might be a useful MFA option in these cases, or how else we can support these Veterans.

This research will build on [discovery research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/discovery/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research) and inform recommendations related to MFA set up and use. With this study, in particular, we're aiming to fill a gap in our understanding of how less-digitally connected Veterans set up and use MFA. This might include:
* Veterans who have limited connectivity or limited access to different devices for a variety of reasons
* un-housed Veterans
* Veterans with severe cognitive disabilities

## Research Goals
We still need to write and agree on research goals for this future study.

## Date
This research will likely take place in June 2023.
