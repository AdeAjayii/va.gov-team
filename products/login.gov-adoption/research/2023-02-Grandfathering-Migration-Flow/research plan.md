# Research Plan: Login.gov Adoption Team, Legacy Credential Migration
*Grandfathering Migration Flow Usability Testing, February 2023*

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These sign in options don't all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. During discovery in December 2022, we defined different pathways for the migration. [See Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/products/legacy%20CSP%20migrations).

This initiative is one of a few migration pathways; here we are focused specifically on moving select DS Logon users to Login.gov without the need to reverify their identities, through “grandfathering” or deferred identity proofing.

In this case, Veterans will receive an IAL1 Login.gov account which works “as normal” for VA services, but can’t be used by other government services until it’s upgraded to IAL2. In order to upgrade to an IAL2 Login.gov account, Veterans will have the option of identity proofing (at a later date, if they choose to).

We plan to run a few rounds of testing to review the effectiveness and usability of this migration pathway. One of these rounds will focus more closely on accessibility, specifically with screen reader users. This will be run separately so that we can wait for a coded prototype for testing. Besides this study, we also plan to run a related study that looks closely at multi-factor authentication set up and usage for Veterans with severe cognitive disabilities, those who are not well digitally connected or those who are unhoused.

### OCTO Objectives 

* Veterans can manage their health services online.
* Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov.

### Veteran Journey
Signing to securely access VA services can happen at any stage in the [Veteran’s journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf). However, in the case of this migration pathway (grandfathering) we're particularly focused on the stages that occur later on in the journey. Other migration initiatives will focus on reaching Veterans who are just getting out and starting up, as they'll aim to help Veterans proactively set up Login.gov (instead of another credential service provider) from the start.

In this case, Veterans will have set up a DS Logon account at some stage in the past. In order for Veterans to not lose access to their information and benefits when DS Logon is sunset by the VA, we need to ensure there is a clear and technically-feasible pathway for migration.

These stages include:
* Taking care of myself
* Putting down roots
* Retiring
* Aging

## Research Goals	
The key goals of this study are to:
1. Review whether Veterans can migrate their accounts from DS Logon to Login.gov (IAL1) without issue.
2. Review whether Veterans understand the type of account they've set up and its limitations. 
3. Review whether Veteran know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.

### Outcome
This research will validate the suggested user flow for Veterans to migrate their accounts to Login.gov through grandfathering or deferred identity proofing. We will aim to find solutions to any issues surfaced. Where there are recommendations we can make to the Login.gov flow, we will raise these to our partners.

Additionally, we will use this research to inform a built prototype which we will test with Veterans again, including screen reader users.

### Research questions
Review whether Veterans can migrate their accounts from DS Logon to Login.gov (IAL1) without issue:
* Are Veterans motivated to set up a Login.gov account when initially prompted, why or why not?
* How confident do Veterans feel about their ability to set up a Login.gov account when initially prompted?
* Can Veterans successfully initiate the account setup flow?
* Can Veterans successfully create their account, including verifying their email address and setting up multi-factor authentication?
* Can Veterans successfully return back to the VA after setting up their account?
* Do Veterans understand they are now signed into Login.gov?

Review whether Veterans understand what type of account they have set up with Login.gov and its limitations:
* Do Veterans understand why they're being asked to set up a Login.gov account?
* Do Veterans understand the type of Login.gov account they are being asked to set up?
* Do Veterans understand that they should now stop using DS Logon and use Login.gov to sign in moving forward?
* Are Veterans motivated to upgrade to an IAL2 Login.gov account at a later date, why or why not?

Review whether Veteran know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.
* What will Veterans do first if they encounter an issue?
* Do Veterans know where or how to get help if they encounter an issue?

## Recruitment	
Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
We aim to recruit at least 10 Veterans for this study.

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session.

* Pilot participant email: 
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research: February 6-10, 2023 (TBC)

### Length of sessions
* Session length: 1 hour
* Buffer time between sessions: 30 minutes
* Maximum sessions per day: 3 sessions

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
