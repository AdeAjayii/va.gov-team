# About this research

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These login options do not all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. During [discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/discovery/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research) in December 2022, we defined different pathways for this migration.

This initiative focuses on moving select DS Logon users to Login.gov without the need to reverify their identities, through “grandfathering” or deferred identity proofing. These Veterans will receive an IAL1 Login.gov account which works “as normal” for VA services, but can’t be used by all government services outside the VA until it’s upgraded to IAL2.

These Veterans will have the option of identity proofing (at a later date, if they choose to) in order to receive an IAL2 Login.gov account that gives them access to other government services, too.

## Research Goals
1. Review whether Veterans can get through the user flow and successfully create an IAL1 Login.gov account without support.
2. Review whether Veterans understand where they can get help if they encounter an issue.
3. Review whether Veterans understand what type of account they have set up with Login.gov, and its limitations.
4. Review whether Veterans who use screen magnification are able to complete the flow without encountering usability issues.
5. Understand what will motivate Veterans to upgrade to an IAL2 account at a later date.

## Recruitment
We will aim to recruit 10 Veterans for this research. They all need to currently use DS Logon to sign in to VA services. Ideally, we can recruit one Veteran who uses DS Logon to sign in to VA services, but has a (proofed) Login.gov account that they've never used to sign in at the VA. We also need to recruit at least 2 screen magnification users.

We aim to do a follow-up study with a coded prototype that can be tested by Veterans who use screen readers.

## Date
This research will take place through February and March 2023.
