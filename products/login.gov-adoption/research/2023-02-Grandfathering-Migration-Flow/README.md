# About this research

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These sign in options don't all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. During [discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/discovery/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research) in December 2022, we defined different pathways for the migration.

This initiative focuses on moving select DS Logon users to Login.gov without the need to reverify their identities, through “grandfathering” or deferred identity proofing, as one of a few approaches to migration. In this case, Veterans will receive an IAL1 Login.gov account which works “as normal” for VA services, but can’t be used by other government services until it’s upgraded to IAL2.

In order to upgrade to an IAL2 Login.gov account, Veterans will have the option of identity proofing (at a later date, if they choose to).

As we review the effectiveness and usability of this grandfathering user flow, we will plan to run a few rounds of testing. After this round, we'll evaluate findings with the potential for a similar round of usability testing is we find major issues to correct and re-test. We will also round a distinct round of testing focused on accessibility, specifically with screen reader users. This will be run separately so that we can wait for a coded prototype for testing.

Besides this study, we also plan to run a related study that looks more closely at multi-factor authentication set up and usage for Veterans with severe cognitive disabilities, who are not well digitally connected or who are unhoused.

## Research Goals
1. Review whether Veterans, including those who use screen magnification, can get through the user flow and successfully create an IAL1 Login.gov account without issues.
2. Review whether Veterans understand where they can get help if they encounter an issue.
3. Review whether Veterans understand what type of account they have set up with Login.gov, and its limitations.
4. Review whether Veterans understand that they should stop using DS Logon and use Login.gov to sign in moving forward.
5. Understand what will motivate Veterans to upgrade to an IAL2 account at a later date.

## Recruitment
We will aim to recruit 10 Veterans for this research. They all need to currently use DS Logon to sign in to VA services. Ideally, we can recruit one Veteran who uses DS Logon to sign in to VA services, but has a (proofed) Login.gov account that they've never used to sign in at the VA. We also need to recruit at least 2 screen magnification users.

We aim to do a follow-up study with a coded prototype that can be tested by Veterans who use screen readers.

## Date
This research will take place through February and March 2023.
