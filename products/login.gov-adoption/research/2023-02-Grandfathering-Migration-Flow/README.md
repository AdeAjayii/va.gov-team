# About this research

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These sign in options don't all meet required security standards and also create user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. During [discovery](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/discovery/2022-10-Login.gov-Adoption-Discovery-Research) in December 2022, we defined different pathways for the migration.

This initiative focuses on moving select DS Logon users to Login.gov without the need to reverify their identities, through “grandfathering” or deferred identity proofing, as one of a few approaches to migration. In this case, Veterans will receive an IAL1 Login.gov account which works “as normal” for VA services, but can’t be used by other government services until it’s upgraded to IAL2.

In order to upgrade to an IAL2 Login.gov account, Veterans will have the option of identity proofing (at a later date, if they choose to).

As we review the effectiveness and usability of this grandfathering user flow, we will plan to run a few rounds of testing. After this round, we'll evaluate findings with the potential for a similar round of usability testing is we find major issues to correct and re-test. We will also round a distinct round of testing focused on accessibility, specifically with screen reader users. This will be run separately so that we can wait for a coded prototype for testing.

Besides this study, we also plan to run a related study that looks more closely at multi-factor authentication set up and usage for Veterans with severe cognitive disabilities, who are not well digitally connected or who are unhoused.

## Research Goals
* Review whether Veterans can migrate their accounts from DS Logon to Login.gov (IAL1) without issue.
* Review whether Veterans understand the type of account they've set up and its limitations.
* Review whether Veteran know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.

## Date
This research will take place through February and March 2023.
