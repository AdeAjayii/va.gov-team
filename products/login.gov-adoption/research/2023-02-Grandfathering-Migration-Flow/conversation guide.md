*Login.gov Adoption Team, Legacy Credential Migration, February 2023*

## Moderator logistics
### 2-3 days before the session
- [ ] Send instructions to observers (such as using the #feedback-backchannel for observer comments, joining the waiting room, having their cameras and microphones muted)
- [ ] Ensure prototype(s) are prepared and Perigean will share them with participants

### Day of the session
- [ ] Prepare prototype on your device and be ready for screen sharing if necessary
- [ ] Mute Slack and email notifications
- [ ] Use #feedback-backchannel to interact with observers (including asking for 'observer instructions' from the Slackbot)
- [ ] Review goals and research questions for this study in the [research plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/login.gov-adoption/research/2023-02-Grandfathering-Migration-Flow/research%20plan.md)

### Starting the session
- [ ] Ensure everyone except the participant is on mute
- [ ] Where necessary, confirm the participant is able to hear and see you

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Tyler and [NOTETAKER'S NAME] is taking notes.

I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about how you sign in to access and manage your VA benefits and health care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I'd like to make sure I don't take too much of your time, so I may occasionally move us along so we can cover everything we're hoping to talk to you about.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Today, you'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is basically like a pretend version of the website. It might not work exactly how you expect. For example, you'll be able to click on somethings on your screen, but not all of them. We use prototypes to help us test things before we decide what to make real, and what to change.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow people to observe today, but I'd like to confirm. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. 
    - Then, ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the rest of the session.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we finish analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

I'd like to start by learning more about your experience with the VA and some of our online services.

- How long have you been a Veteran?
- How often do you go online to access and manage your VA benefits and health care?
- Do you remember the last time you signed into the VA online?
- Why were you signing in, that day? (What we're you trying to do, that day?)
- Can you describe to me how it usually works when you sign into VA.gov (or eBenefits or MHV)? What do you do first?
- Is there anything else you want to share with me about signing in, before we move on?

### Things to watch for:
- Does the Veteran recall whether they usually start on VA.gov, eBenefits, My HealtheVet or another VA application?
- Does the Veteran recall using DS Logon, MHV, Login.gov or ID.me to sign in?

## First Task: Signing into VA.gov - 10 minutes

Next, I'm going to share something we're working on with you so I can get your feedback.

- Step 1
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

- Does VA.gov look familiar to the Veteran?
- Does the Veteran notice or mentioned the different sign in options, on the sign in page?

Are Veterans motivated to set up a Login.gov account when initially prompted, why or why not?
[If we are prepared to test an alternate flow, with a different trigger] Are Veterans more or less motivated by the alternate flow?
How confident do Veterans feel about their ability to set up a Login.gov account when initially prompted?
Can Veterans successfully initiate the account setup flow?
Can Veterans successfully create their account, including verifying their email address and setting up multi-factor authentication?
Can Veterans successfully return back to the VA after setting up their account?
Do Veterans understand they are now signed into Login.gov?
Do Veterans have concerns about their data or information now that they use a different sign in method?
Do Vetetans have concerns about their ability to continue accessing VA services, now that they have a new login method?
Review whether Veterans understand what type of account they have set up with Login.gov and its limitations:

Do Veterans understand why they're being asked to set up a Login.gov account?
Do Veterans understand the type of Login.gov account they are being asked to set up?
Do Veterans understand that they should now stop using DS Logon and use Login.gov to sign in moving forward?
Are Veterans motivated to upgrade to an IAL2 Login.gov account at a later date, why or why not?
Review whether Veterans know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.

What will Veterans do first if they encounter an issue?
Do Veterans know where or how to get help if they encounter an issue?

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
