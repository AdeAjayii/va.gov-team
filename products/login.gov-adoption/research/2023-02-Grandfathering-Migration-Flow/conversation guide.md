## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Tyler and [NOTETAKER'S NAME] is taking notes.

I also have a few other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them... 

Today we're going to talk about how you sign in to access and manage your VA benefits and health care.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 1 hour.** I'd like to make sure I don't take too much of your time, so I may occasionally move us along so we can cover everything we're hoping to talk to you about.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **Today, you'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is basically like a pretend version of the website. It might not work exactly how you expect. For example, you'll be able to click on somethings on your screen, but not all of them. We use prototypes to help us test things before we decide what to make real, and what to change.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- Perigean did ask for your consent to allow people to observe today, but I'd like to confirm. **Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?**
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
    - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on, introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. 
    - Then, ask notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the rest of the session.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we finish analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up - 5 minutes

I'd like to start by learning more about your experience with the VA and some of our online services.

* How long have you been a Veteran?
* How often do you go online to access and manage your VA benefits and health care?
* Do you remember the last time you signed into the VA online?
* Why were you signing in, that day? [What we're you trying to do, that day?]
* Can you describe to me how it usually works when you sign into VA.gov [or eBenefits or MHV]? What do you do first?
* Is there anything else you want to share with me about signing in, before we move on?

Great, thanks!

### Things to watch for:
- Does the Veteran recall whether they usually start on VA.gov, eBenefits, My HealtheVet or another VA application?
- Does the Veteran recall using DS Logon, MHV, Login.gov or ID.me to sign in?

## Task 1: Sign into VA.gov - 10 minutes

Next, Iâ€™d like to share some ideas with you so we can get your feedback.

In a minute, I'm going to send you a link to a prototype. I mentioned earlier that a prototype is like a pretend version of the VA website. So it's going to look similar, but it won't work as you might expect it, because it's not a real website.

Okay, I've just sent you a link in the chat. [Help them open it and share their screen].

*Screen: VA.gov homepage*

Now that you have this open, I'd like you to start by imagining that you've just went online to [reference a task they do online with the VA]. First, you need to sign in.

- Can you tell me what you would do first, to sign in?

Thanks, you can go ahead and click sign in, now.

*Screen: Sign in pop-up window*

- Before we click anything, can you tell me what you would do next, if you were signing in?
- Is DS Logon [or other credential they mention] usually how you sign in to the VA?

Great, we're going to imagine you signed in with DS Logon, today. You can click sign in and we'll continue.

*Screen: DS Logon sign in page*

Let's pretend you put in your username and password. You can click Login, now.

*Screen: Modal recommending migration*

- Before we read this in detail, can you describe to me what you're looking at, now?
- Why do you think this has appeared on your screen?
- Now, remembering that, in this scenario, you signed in to [reference the task they are doing]. What would you do if you saw this screen, instead?

I'm going to give you a second to read this more closely now. When you're finished, I'd like you to summarize what you read.

- Can you summarize what you just read, for me?
- Do you have any initial questions, after reading this?
- In this scenario, would you be interested in setting up a Login.gov account right now? Why or why not?
- What hesitations do you have about setting up a Login.gov account?
- Why do you think the VA is recommending that you set up a Login.gov?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the Veteran use DS Logon (or another credential) to sign in, usually?
- Does the Veteran appear confused at all throughout the sign-in flow?
- Does the Veteran appear motivated to set up a Login.gov account when initially prompted?
- Does the Veteran appear hesitant or confident about what they're being asked to do?

## Task 2: Create an IAL1 Login.gov Account - 20 minutes

Okay great. For today, let's imagine that you are going to set up a Login.gov account.

*Screen: Modal recommending migration*

- Before you click anything, can you tell me what you would do first to set up an account?
- Before you click anything, what do you expect to see when you click [that]?

Great, let's go ahead and click [link text].

*Screen: Create an account*

As we go through the next couple of steps, I'd like for you to describe out loud what you're thinking or what you would do next. If you have a question or something interests you, let me know so we can chat about it.

- 

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

Can Veterans successfully initiate the account setup flow?
Can Veterans successfully create their account, including verifying their email address and setting up multi-factor authentication?
Can Veterans successfully return back to the VA after setting up their account?
Do Veterans understand they are now signed into Login.gov?
Do Veterans have concerns about their data or information now that they use a different sign in method?
Do Vetetans have concerns about their ability to continue accessing VA services, now that they have a new login method?
Review whether Veterans understand what type of account they have set up with Login.gov and its limitations:

Do Veterans understand why they're being asked to set up a Login.gov account?
Do Veterans understand the type of Login.gov account they are being asked to set up?
Do Veterans understand that they should now stop using DS Logon and use Login.gov to sign in moving forward?
Are Veterans motivated to upgrade to an IAL2 Login.gov account at a later date, why or why not?
Review whether Veterans know where to get help or what they will do if they encounter an issue during or after account setup.

What will Veterans do first if they encounter an issue?
Do Veterans know where or how to get help if they encounter an issue?

## Third Task: [TASK NAME] - X minutes

- Step 1
- Step 2

### Things to watch for:

- [Does the participant understand meaning of xyz?]
- [Does the participant notice xyz?]
- [Etc]

## Cool down - 5 minutes

- Question 1
- Question 2
- Do you have any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]
