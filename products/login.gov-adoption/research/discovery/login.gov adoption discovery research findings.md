## Research Goals
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access My HealtheVet and other VA services. These login options don’t all meet the required security standards and also create frustration and confusion for users.

Through our research, we hoped to explore how the VA can most successfully migrate existing users, and onboard new user to Login.gov (which is a compliant, single sign-on credentialing platform). While Login.gov does currently exist, our research hopes to uncover the best ways to support Veterans, non-Veteran roles, and VA staff in this transition.

### How this research maps to the Veteran journey
1. Attending to health needs: How can we proactively intervene at this stage to make sure Veterans are able to create a Login.gov account they will use to access My HealtheVet going forward?
2. Managing my declining health: How can we help Veterans who are aging and managing their declining health have clear and technically-feasible options to transition their access to My HealtheVet to Login.gov and ID.me?

### Goals
1. Understand how we can intervene to ensure that new generations of Veterans use Login.gov or ID.me to access My HealtheVet from the start.
2. Understand what in-person support will enable Veterans to create and use a Login.gov account to access My HealtheVet.
3. Understand how the greatest number of Veterans can use multi-factor authentication options, including security keys.
4. Understand how setting up and maintaining shared access might work for Veterans and non-Veterans.

## Research Questions

* When should proactive intervention encourage the creation of a Login.gov account?
* What do Veterans find important or beneficial when choosing a login credential?
* How do we communicate the need to migrate to Login.gov to access services?
* How do we support Veterans and non-Veterans after they set up Login.gov?
* When people in-person proof and migrate their account, what issues arise for them?
* What resources or workflows will help with issues during in-person proofing & migration?
* How do Veterans understand the process of choosing and using a MFA method?
* Which MFA options will allow more Veterans to migrate to Login.gov?
* How can MFA support non-Veterans who need access to parts of a Veterans’ information?
* Which non-Veteran users would Veterans choose to set up access for, when and why?
* How do non-Veterans imagine shared access to work for themselves and non-Veterans?

## Methodology 

1. Scenario Validation: We presented Veterans with a scenario showing a potential approach to creating a Login.gov account and accessing My HealtheVet. This helped us evaluate whether Veteran finds a particular solution is useful, clear, appropriate or concerning.

2. Service Prototype Testing: We used this method alongside scenarios, walking Veterans through a service prototype of how they would in-person proof, set up multi-factor authentication and secure a Login.gova account at a VA facility. This helped us evaluate the workflow and support needed.

3. Intercepts: We ran contextual intercepts with Veterans where we shared various stimuli, like, an email or a login screen. This helped us clarifying content and tone-of-voice of messaging, in particular, and reach Veterans who don’t yet have a My HealtheVet or Login.gov account.

## Key Findings

1. Setting up a new credential is frustrating for Veterans if it's made to seem like a choice or the need is unclear.

2. Veterans see security as the VA's responsibility, but they're motivated to be more careful if their at risk for not being able to access their benefits, or, they understand how their actions affect fellow Veterans.

3. Bundling identity proofing with other appointments, and moving it the beginning or end of the account set up process, makes it more convenient for Veterans.

4. Veterans will choose whichever login credential is most familiar, or appears to be the most direct route to completing a task.

5. Perceived ease of use and paradoxical views about security inform Veterans' multi-factor authentication choices.

6. Veterans don't think to set up shared access until life altering events make it necessary for others to have access to their information.

7. Having humanized, contextualized and dedicated help available motivates Veterans to set up and continue to use a credential.

## Details of Findings

**1. Setting up a new credential is frustrating for Veterans if it's made to seem like a choice or the need is unclear.**

Messaging that suggestions setting up a new credential is optional, when it is in fact required is frustrating for Veterans – they want clear instructions about what is expected of them.

Veterans aren't buying Login.gov, so rather than selling it to them they need clarity about what it is they need to do. Transparency around government decisions and spending serves more than satisfying a curiosity, it instills trust and supports people to embrace change.

> "If Login.gov is the preferred method, the VA has to say that and stop providing options." Participant 9, Veteran Interview

> "They could use the money they are using for Login.gov to help Veterans [instead]." Participant 4, Veteran Interview

> “We're good at following orders, we ran into gunfire." Participant 1, Veteran Interview

<br>

**2. Veterans see security as the VA's responsibility, but they're motivated to be more careful if their at risk for not being able to access their benefits, or, they understand how their actions affect fellow Veterans.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `BNFT: Healthcare`, `VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

While Veterans might distrust the government, they tend to overestimate its online security and  feel it's the responsibility of the VA to make sure things are secure, not theirs. 

Many Veterans perceive little risk around their medical information being hacked, but are deeply worried about not being able to access their doctors and prescriptions through My HealtheVet. While someone hacking your account is abstract and, therefore, less concerning, the risk of not being able to access My HealtheVet to complete a healthcare task is worrisome.

Veterans are eager to share information that will benefit other Veteran, so their experiences can have a ripple effect and impact adoption, good or bad. This also means that, when thinking about security, Veterans are often more motivated by concerns about fellow Veterans' data, than they are about their own.

> "I understand that they are trying to be secure, but I also know that when it comes to the Internet, nothing is under lock." Participant 4, Veteran Interview

> "They've put enough security measures in place to ensure the person logging on is secure." Participant 8, Veteran Interview

<br>

**3. Bundling identity proofing with other appointments, and moving it the beginning or end of the account set up process, makes it more convenient for Veterans.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `BNFT: Healthcare`, `MHV: Appointments`,`VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

Setting up Login.gov alongside another VA appointment is a welcome convenience for Veterans, as long as it represents a definitive start or end to the process. But, if it creates another ongoing process then Veterans are less likely to see it through.

While Veterans appreciate bundling tasks with appointments, bundling communications causes confusion and fear around doing something wrong.

Moving between online and offline touchpoints can create confusion – but clarity on what to bring, why you’re identity proofing and how it won't affect your existing appointments or accounts, helps put Veterans at ease.

> "I would set up Login.gov at the end of my appointment, while I'm here. I'd rather get more done in a single period." Participant 6, Veteran Intercept

> "I'm unsure if they want me to bring ID, then they want me to use my password and username? If I don't click yes, then I'm worried I wouldn't be able to go to my appointment." Participant 3, Veteran Interview

<br>

**4. Veterans will choose whichever login credential is most familiar, or appears to be the most direct route to completing a task.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `BNFT: Healthcare`, `VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

Veterans will choose whichever login credential is most familiar, or appears to be the most direct route to completing a task. If Login.gov is the only option available for accessing valued services, Veterans will use it, but they’d like to know the reason for the changing requirements.

> "I seem to press 'My HealtheVet' more often than not. I think it's because that is where I'm going. It feels more direct, like it's getting me right in." Participant 10, Veteran Interview

> "If you keep presenting me with those same options every time, just out of habit, I'm going to keep doing what I've been doing." Participant 7, Veteran Interview

<br>

**5. Perceived ease of use and paradoxical views about security inform Veterans' multi-factor authentication choices.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

Perceived ease of use drives Veterans' multi-factor authentication choices –  they may want high-security in theory, but choose what they see as an easier option in practice.

Ingrained responsibility for government-issued property undermines the perception that a security key from the VA would an easy and low-stress MFA option. And while biometrics can at first feel like a violation, through repeated exposure it's increasingly embraced as an easy option requiring no memory. When choosing a multi-factor authentication option, Veterans weigh intrusiveness against ease of setup and continued use.

> "I'm old, using something new makes me feel old and dumb." Participant 26, Veteran Intercept

> "My personal concern is not being able to use my own device resulting in not being able to have the password securely generated and stored in my password manager. I do not want to have to write this password down." Participant 7, Veteran Interview

<br>

**6. Veterans don't think to set up shared access until life altering events make it necessary for others to have access to their information.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `AUD: Caregivers`,`PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `BNFT: Healthcare`, `VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

Veterans don't think to set up shared access until life altering events make it necessary for others to have access to their information. Shared access asks Veterans to consider who they trust and who will take care of them in the future, which can evolve or change over time.

With more complex care situations, caretakers recognize the need for nuanced permissions when accessing a Veterans' information. Veterans and their support systems find it important that a Veteran is able to grant and revoke shared access and see exactly what has been accessed by others.

> “It depends on my trust in the person who I give access, what I would give them access to. My husband could have full access, but my children, would be able to see my medications only.” Participant 15, Veteran Intercept

> "I would feel fine about [giving access] to my wife. She's the pilot and I'm the copilot. It would be convenient." Participant 18, Veteran Intercept

> "What if I'm going through a divorce and they use my medical records against me? 75% of my disability is PTSD. In court, it could be used against me in terms of childcare rights. But there is a need regardless, if I'm blind or can't print out a prescription." Participant 3, Veteran Interview

<br>

**7. Having humanized, contextualized and dedicated help available motivates Veterans to set up and continue to use a credential.**

Labels: `AUD: Veterans`, `AUD: Contact Center`, `PRDT: Login.gov`, `PRDT: Login`, `VETJNY: Taking care of themselves
Veteran`, `RESRCH: Generative (discovery)`, `RESRCH: Evaluative`, `RESRCH: Interviews`, `RESRCH: In-person`

Knowing that quality, dedicated help is available makes Veterans more willing to try to set up and continue to use a new credential. 

Many older Veterans are highly competent and familiar account creation and MFA. They want to be empowered to do things online themselves, but may have limited troubleshooting skills. Rather than requiring Veterans to be able to diagnosis their problem to find a solution, Veterans want a person or artifact, that will speak their language and can guide them through the steps in a way that makes sense to them.

Even technologically challenged Veterans see benefits in My HealtheVet services, they just need a trusted intermediary who can assist them to set up and learn how to use it.

Building on familiar paradigms and offering proactive support to make the Veteran feel smarter than the system will lower frustration and result in high successful account set up and adoption.

> "Plenty of people use MFA and have issues. My parents would be a great example of technologically challenged people that need help – but usually they just have to learn how to do it a few times, get used to it and then they are fine." Participant 12, Veteran Intercept

> "The lady at the desk here is already busy, she has to check in more people and get them set up with healthcare. She doesn't have time to help me set up Login.gov, then people would be waiting. But maybe there if there's someone else in a different room..." Participant 6, Veteran Intercept

> "I would walk away at this point unless someone is walking through it on my phone with me." Participant 7, Veteran Interview
