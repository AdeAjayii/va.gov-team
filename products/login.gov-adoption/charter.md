## What we strive for

### Vision

The fragmented sign-in experience is confusing for Veterans and non-Veterans faced with multiple pathways and credential options. Further, the credential options are insecure, non-compliant, have poor user experience, or are expensive. VA needs a streamlined way for Veterans to sign-in and securely access products and services.

- One sign-on to access all products and services.
- Veteran choice of “public” or “private” credential option for VA.gov

### Mission 

The CEDAR IDIQ will connect VA employees with industry partners to deliver high-quality, digital products following modern best practices to improve service delivery to Veterans.

- Give VA streamlined access to a small group of exceptional companies that specialize in agile software development and user-centered design
- Create a contract mechanism that incentives VA employees and contractors to deliver rapidly following private sector best practices
- Promote the principles of Agile and DevOps culture in VA
- Support VA’s digital modernization strategy to solve tough technology challenges facing VA


### OCTO Objectives
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov

### North star objectives

- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services 
- Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome 
- Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

## Workflow + Cadence

### Stand-up: people & product check-ins

* **My VA Team**: Daily @ 10:30am ET 
  
1. Team update
  - What I did yesterday? 
  -  What will I do today? 
  - Any blockers?
2. General discussion

### Sprint Planning
Outline team and member focus, goals for sprint:  
- 1st Thursday of every sprint  
- 1-2 hour(s) 

### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, areas for improvement, what to start doing:   
- 1st Thursday of every sprint, right before planning   
- 60 min

### Grooming
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint and loosely discuss next/future sprint(s):  
- 2nd Thursday of every sprint for one-hour

#### What

In grooming, we will walk through each team member's Zenhub board to make sure tickets are ready by the time we get to sprint planning. By the end of grooming:

- 100% of tickets have are associated with an epic.
- 100% of tickets have acceptance criteria.
- 100% of tickets are estimated.
- 100% of tickets are appropriately labeled.
- At least 2 sprints out, 5 tickets tentatively assigned to those iterations.

#### Prior to grooming

Please review `needs-grooming` tickets within your discipline (determined by the right GitHub label e.g. `frontend`).

### Issue Etiquette

#### Issue creation

You can create issues for yourself or the team throughout the sprint. We'll use grooming to get tickets ready to go before they are put in the "Current Sprint" column on our Zenhub board.

For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):
- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels - login.gov-adoption (and cross functional team labels)
- User Story, Goal, Acceptance Criteria - please fill out the Goal and any known acceptance criteria. The PM will revise as necessary.
- Epic assigned
- Milestone
  
#### Estimation
Estimation is based on a combination of a few factors — how long something will take to complete, risk, level of effort (LOE), and complexity. We have found [this scale](https://www.scalablepath.com/blog/agile-points-explained-fibonacci-sequence/) to be helpful in estimating tickets.

 - 1 - Easy task, work is known, can be executed quickly   
 - 2 - Mostly known, doable
 - 3 - Becoming complex, maybe be 2 - 3 days of work 
 - 5 - More complex, may take a full week   
 - 8 - Needs to be broken down into smaller user stories      

#### Issue validation 

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint.
 
### Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

**And some logistics:**

- Keep as much Slack conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to an issue or useful to document, copy them into GitHub.
- Our tickets/issues have an estimated level of effort, clear acceptance criteria, and an individual or team assignee before being put in a sprint.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
