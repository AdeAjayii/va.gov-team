`eBenefits | June 2020`

Today we're going to be going through the form 21 686 C or the dependency claims application a common action veterans take is making changes to the dependence that are connected to their benefits and awards using this form the veteran can then inform the VA about additional depends that can take advantage of their benefits and remove dependencies as needed for various reasons. 

So let's get started by looking at the view component. 

Right now the user that has logged in doesn't have any dependence on file. This shows a blue error message saying we can't find any dependence to add to your disability award. There's a some actions that they can take in the event that they want to correct us. What this would look like if they're were dependents in this account is this you can see here the there's three dependents here listed on your VA benefits, and then down here you can see that there's one example of a, Dependent that is not associated with any current VA benefits in your in the Veterans account. 

So let's move forward into the actual application itself. 

Now, again this a user already has an application in progress save in place as working rate. So we want to have the option of either continuing the application or starting a new application. So let's for this example start a new application and we'll confirm that. This screen here will then allow the veteran to select all a card what workflows they're most interested in. 

For this demonstration, we'll go ahead and walk through the entire form. I'll be at maybe pretty quick. I'm gonna, Do my best to speed the video up for some of the data entry opponents that are not necessarily as interesting but we'll talk about some of the callouts that are important for this form. 

This next screen allows the veteran to confirm some of this more static information that needs to be called using this number and the event that they want to have that changed. Once that's done we can hit continue. 

Again, another call out we would have here is that if the veteran is on a military base outside the US they would check this box and see that country is defaulted to the United States and that city has been converted over to APO FPL or DPO. You could learn more about that by dropping this down and and reading a little bit about that help protects. 

I'm gonna go ahead and enter this information in here. 

It should be noted that in the event that information that it's said to be required is not entered. A red request will pop up and show the veteran that they need to enter the the proper response this is true for any field that has it requirement. 

Starting with the information to add a child. 

Sometimes you could add more than one entity and in which case there's this example here you can add another child and you can see the previous child is up here and now we would add the the second child. 

For the first child we can see here from what I entered before we're gonna enter the child's place of birth. 

For any response that is other than biological there's additional evidence, that will be required. More information on this can be found here. 

You can also indicate whether or not this child was previously married or not and the relevant information therein. 

If the child lives with you, you can simply click yes and move on else you would be asked to invite to enter the information that is required. 

I'm gonna skip this part. 

Here you can see the different marriage types ceremonial is the most traditional most common common log tribal and proxy are some others and then if there is something outside the scope of that the veterans invited to type that in. If you select a marriage type other than ceremony ceremonial you'll be required to add additional evidence to establish that spouse. 

Again if the spouse does not live with you you are asked to enter them in here. 

In the event your spouse was married before. You're asked to include the former spouses information. For your spouse. 

Term over to report information needed to indicate that there's been a marriage of a child under 18, you would feel this out. 

For a child between the ages of 18 to 23 that has stopped attending school. 

First step child, that is no longer part of your household. 

Information needed to add a student 18 to 23 years. 

This is the further student's address where the student is living while attending school. 

This is for the information needed to add student 18 to 23 years old indicating what term or core states are relevant for the student. 

If the student attended school last term or not if they did you can enter that information here if not we move on. 

This page is part of the review and confirmation process of this form where each of these accordions expands to show the relevant information inside this does a recap of all the different workflows that we selected and each of these sections indicates the entered data. If any of this needs to be changed, you can simply come in to the section hit edit and, Complete that hit update or even add another deceased dependent for example. 

Or remove them. 

From here. I'll check the privacy policy box. Submit the application. Since staging so this doesn't submit right now. 

That's it for the 21686, thank you.
