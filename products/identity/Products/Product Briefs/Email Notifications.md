# Email Notifications

## Overview: (Provide a high level description of the product/set of features)

Send Veterans emails when there is a login to their account under what might be fradulent circumstances, including:
* Logins from New Devices
* Unusual Account Activity
* Password Reset Requests
* Changes to Security Settings
* Logins From High-Risk Locations



## Problem Statement: (Describe what problem weâ€™re going to address with this product)
If we send a Veteran notification about a login that they did not initiate, it can serve as an early warning sign of unauthorized access or a security breach.

One of our OKRs reducing the time to detect fraud by 10%, and by notifiying Veterans of unusual logins, Veterans can take immediate steps, such as changing passwords, reviewing account activity, or contacting the VA, in order to secure their accounts and prevent further unauthorized actions.
