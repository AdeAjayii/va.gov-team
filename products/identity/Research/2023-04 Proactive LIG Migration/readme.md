## Background

There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These sign in options don't all meet required security standards. Having so many also create user frustration and confusion. The goal is to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov. Discovery research by related teams defined several pathways for the migration.

This research focuses on a modification of one of those migration pathways. We're seeking ways to encourage Veterans to adopt a modern CSP as their primary credential on their own, and preemptive to any announcement about sunsetting legacy credentials.

This study is part of a body of research work that is taking place across multiple Identity teams.

## Research goals

- Identify which terms helps veterans undersand account creation, migration, verification, and authentication so the call to action for those will be better understood 
- Find out best ways to encourage more veterans to migrate CSPs now, even before sunsetting of legacy accounts(s)
- Test the usability of a modal prototype that encourages veterans to signup for a login.gov account
