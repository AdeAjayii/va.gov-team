# WIP - the research plan template will be filled in as we plan 

# Research Plan for Identity, Proactive Login.gov Migration, [Date]
 

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These Credential Service Providers (CSPs) don't all meet required security standards and so many choices creates user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov as a first choice or ID.me. During discovery research, the LGA team defined different pathways for the migration.

The pathway this research focuses on is to promote Organic Adoption of login.gov - encouraging veterans to migrate to a modern CSP now, ahead of sunsetting.

### In scope for this research
- verbiage for what veterans call a "verified account"
- veterans who use a legacy CSP
- self-directed migration to a modern CSP

### Out of scope for this research
- Support for account creation or proofing
   - like potential VA integrations with login.gov account creation process
   - like potential VA work to help veterans through the current login.gov (or ID.me) account creation process
- Pathway for Grandfathering accounts from legacy CSP
   - like binding to login.gov verified accounts based off legacy proofing
- Pathway for organic adoption of login.gov (those who are creating an account for the first times)

### OCTO Objectives 

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
- Decrease: Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey

Securely accessing VA digital services can happen at any stage in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf).
This initiative focuses on Veterans who are using either DS Logon or MHV as their CSP. To help Veterans keep access to their information and benefits as VA prepares to sunset legacy CSPs, this study seeks ways to encourage veterans and others with accounts to proceed with migration before being forced to.


## Research Goals

- Test the usability of a modal prototype that encourages veterans to signup for a login.gov account
- Identify which term is most understandable and resonates most when describing an ID proofed account
- Find out best ways to encourage more veterans to migrate CSPs now, even before sunsetting of legacy accounts(s)


### Outcome

We hope to learn the best words or phrases to use so that veterans and others accessing va.gov understand the difference between their current CSP and what we are asking them to migrate to.
We’ll also validate a modal prototype to learn if it makes sense to move forward with it as is or even at all

From both of these we’ll gain understanding about how to encourage va.gov legacy account holders to migrate to one of the modern CSPs early but on their own timeline, before they encounter stress of possible disruption of service.

### Research questions

- Is the modal useful in encouraging organic adoption of a modern CSP?
- Would any changes make the modal more helpful or more encouraging?
- What word or phrase will best convey to veterans the concept of “ID proof” or “verified account”?
- How might we encourage more veterans to migrate their CSP now, on their own, before sunsetting forces it?


### Hypothesis

- Some veterans will be motivated to migrate from a legacy CSP with some encouragement, like the modal prototype
- Most veterans will choose to ignore the modal their first time seeing it
- Veterans will have a term or phrase for “verified account” that we can use to better speak to the process.


## Methodology	

Remote usability testing will evaluate the modal prototype on **[mobile/desktop/TBD]**. This will be paired with interview questions to evaluate use of words and phrases we can use to best convey these concepts to veterans.
We’ll use Perigean’s Zoom account for these remote sessions

## Recruitment	


### Recruitment approach

We will use Perigean to recruit Veterans for this moderated study. Since this study builds on previous research looking at the same or substantially similar topics, this research will consider any gaps in the representation from previous research and aim to target underrepresented groups from this body of work.

- [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing)

### Recruitment criteria

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

All participants:
- Must have a computer and be willing to complete their sessions on this device (Note: In subsequent rounds, we will include and favour mobile testing)
- Must be willing to share a web browser window on their computer
- Must have a working microphone on their computer
- Must have Zoom downloaded to their computer prior to the session and know how to share their screen

In addition our Primary criteria includes
- Must be Veterans

### Screener questions

To support the above criteria, we’ve provided the following screener questions:
1. Have you signed in to VA.gov, My HealtheVet or eBenefits in the last 6 months?
   - [answer must be yes to qualify]
2. Which method do you use to sign in? [options 1. DS Logon, 2. My HealtheVet, 3. ID.me or 4. Login.gov] it may be helpful to reference [the sign in page](https://www.va.gov/?next=loginModal)

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
- Planned dates of research: 2023 April TBD
- Session length: **-minute** sessions 
- Session buffer: **60-minute breaks** in between
- Max sessions per day: 4
