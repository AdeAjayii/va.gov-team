### Research Goals:

-   Explore Veterans' knowledge of personal device management as well as management of concurrent sessions on multiple devices.
    
-   Explore Veterans' understanding of the use cases for device management and the security implications of multiple active sessions on various devices.
    
-   Test the user flow for how a Veteran would access device management and signing out of multiple devices at once.
    

### Research Questions:

-   Are there any potential concerns about ending sessions and signing people out of their accounts on all devices? (Review previous research on stickiness of sessions).
    
-   Does the prototype allow users to successfully navigate to and utilize the proposed user flow for managing their devices?
    
-   What updates to the user flow could we incorporate to make it more intuitive for Veterans?
    
-   Is there any confusion regarding connected applications and device management?
    

### Hypotheses and Conclusions:

-   Veterans will be split on their understanding of a rationale for signing out of all devices.
    
-   Most Veterans will never have used the option of signing out of all of their devices on other websites.
    
-   Veterans will need an explanation of the implications of signing out of all their devices in order to make an informed decision to proceed.
    
-   Veterans will expect the platform to take accountability for their security e.g. if there are suspected instances of malware, phishing scams, etc. the VA.gov website will automatically end all user sessions and inform the Veteran.
    
-   Veterans are willing to sacrifice security for convenience of not having to sign back into their devices.
    

### Methodology:
-  Remote usability testing will evaluate the prototype with participants. We’ll use Perigean’s Zoom account for these remote sessions. We plan to test with both mobile and desktop users and with assistive tech users.

### Key Findings:
