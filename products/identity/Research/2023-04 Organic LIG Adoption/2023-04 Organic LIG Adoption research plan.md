# WIP - the research plan template will be filled in as we plan 

# Research Plan for Identity, Organic Login.gov Adoption, [Date]
 

## Background
There are currently multiple ways to sign in and access VA services. These Credential Service Providers (CSPs) don't all meet required security standards and so many choices creates user frustration and confusion. We need to migrate Veterans from legacy credential service providers (DS Logon and My HealtheVet) to Login.gov as a first choice or ID.me. During discovery research, the LGA team defined different pathways for the migration.

The pathway this research focuses on is to promote Organic Adoption of login.gov - encouraging veterans to migrate to a modern CSP now, ahead of sunsetting.

### OCTO Objectives 

- Veterans and their families can apply for all benefits online
- Veterans can manage their health services online
- Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
- Decrease: Call center volume, wait time, and time to resolution

### Veteran Journey

Securely accessing VA digital services can happen at any stage in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf).
This initiative focuses on Veterans who are using either DS Logon or MHV as their CSP. To help Veterans keep access to their information and benefits as VA prepares to sunset legacy CSPs, this study seeks ways to encourage veterans and others with accounts to proceed with migration before being forced to.


## Research Goals

- Test the usability of a modal prototype that encourages veterans to signup for a login.gov account
- Identify which term is most understandable and resonates most when describing an ID proofed account
- Find out best ways to encourage more veterans to migrate CSPs now, even before sunsetting of legacy accounts(s)


### Outcome

We hope to learn the best words or phrases to use so that veterans and others accessing va.gov understand the difference between their current CSP and what we are asking them to migrate to.
We’ll also validate a modal prototype to learn if it makes sense to move forward with it as is or even at all

From both of these we’ll gain understanding about how to encourage va.gov legacy account holders to migrate to one of the modern CSPs early but on their own timeline, before they encounter stress of possible disruption of service.

### Research questions

- Is the modal useful in encouraging organic adoption of a modern CSP?
- Would any changes make the modal more helpful or more encouraging?
- What word or phrase will best convey to veterans the concept of “ID proof” or “verified account”?
- How might we encourage more veterans to migrate their CSP now, on their own, before sunsetting forces it?


### Hypothesis

- Some veterans will be motivated to migrate from a legacy CSP with some encouragement, like the modal prototype
- Most veterans will choose to ignore the modal their first time seeing it
- Veterans will have a term or phrase for “verified account” that we can use to better speak to the process.


## Methodology	

Remote usability testing will evaluate the modal prototype on **[mobile/desktop/TBD]**. This will be paired with interview questions to evaluate use of words and phrases we can use to best convey these concepts to veterans.
We’ll use Perigean’s Zoom account for these remote sessions

## Recruitment	

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
