Thank you for joining this session today! I first want to make sure that we are able to hear each other.

[WAIT FOR RESPONSE - if can’t hear, [troubleshoot](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/troubleshooting-for-va-gov-research-sessions-in-pr#Troubleshootingresearchsessions-Problem:Usercannothearyou/youcan'thearthemonZoom) otherwise...]

Great! I’m [YOUR NAME] and I’m a researcher for VA.gov. 
I also have [NOTE TAKER NAME] here today, who I’ll now ask to introduce themself.

[PAUSE FOR NOTE TAKER to introduce themself]

We have a couple other team members in the waiting room who would like to observe and help take notes. But before we invite them, I'd like to tell you more about what we're doing today.
- The subject of our research today is the login and account process.
- Today we're going to talk about how you sign in to access and manage your VA benefits and health care.
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. The goal is to improve this process to better meet veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your candid feedback.
- In this session, I’ll also ask you to interact with a prototype. It will look real, but it isn’t, and we won’t be accessing your account or real information. We use prototypes to help us test things before we decide what to make real.
- This entire session will take no more than 1 hour.
- I do want you to be as comfortable as possible, so if for any reason and at any time you want to pause or even stop the session, please let me know.
- Perigean did previously ask for your consent to allow other people to observe today, but I know things can change. So I'd like to confirm with you now - are you okay with a couple of additional observers joining us during this session?
   - [If NO]: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - [If YES]: Admit observers.
      - Let’s have each of our observers quickly go around and introduce themselves with cameras on, please. 
      - [PAUSE for observers to introduce themselves]
      - Ok and now I’ll ask our notetakers and observers to mute themselves and turn off their cameras for the remainder of the sessions to save on distractions and to save Zoom bandwidth.
- I want to ask your permission for another iten now. We do like to record these sessions. This helps us so we can look back for clarifications like to make sure we noted your opinions correctly. We delete recordings after we finish analysis, which usually takes a couple weeks. Also we sometimes write quotes down to help others at the VA understand why we want to make certain changes, but your name will not be directly linked to any of your comments.
- Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and our audio as we talk today?
   - [IF YES - RECORD TO CLOUD] 
   - Now that we are recording, I have to confirm once more - are you are ok if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
- [WAIT FOR RESPONSE]
- Ok, we are ready to go


## Round 1: Mobile internet use questions| 5 minutes

I'd like to start with a few questions to get to know how you use your phone online…

- Would you mind telling me what devices do you generally use to go online?
   - [PROMPT] Do you regularly use a computer to go online?
      - [It could be desktop or laptop, one you own or one you borrow]
   - [PROMPT] Do you regularly use a mobile phone to go online?
   - [PROMPT] Do you regularly use a tablet to go online?
- Which of these would you say you use the most when going online?
   - Could you tell me about why you tend to use [THAT DEVICE] the most?
Have you accessed a bank account or health account on your phone in the past?
   - [IF YES] Do you have a preference for accessing an account like that, either on your phone or on a computer?
   - Have you ever used your phone to create a new account for a website or service?
   - [IF YES] How did that go?
      - [PROMPT] Did you find any issues or difficulties when doing that?
   - [IF NO] Is that something you would consider doing from a phone?
      - Could you explain that a bit more?
   - For an account you already have, let’s say that you need to update the phone number or password for that. Have you ever used a phone for doing something like that?
   - [PROMPT] That could be either on the VA or another website
   - [IF YES] Could you walk me through an experience you’ve had with doing that from your phone?
   - [IF NO] Would you only do something like that from a desktop or laptop computer?
      - Could you tell me a little more about why?


## Round 2: Account terms questions | 10 minutes

I’d like to take some time to think about a few words or phrases that the VA might use when talking about online accounts. I want to remind you that this isn’t a test of you or your vocabulary. Instead we are interested in understanding what you and other veterans call things so we can make instructions more clear and understandable.

- When you go to a website and want to access your personal information, you probably have to type in your username, which sometimes is your email address, and then your password. What would you call that process?
   - Do you have any accounts with personal information, like a bank account or health provider account that has more steps to the sign in process than username and password?
   - [PROMPT] Let's say that while signing in, a site said they were going to text you a 6 digit number - have you ever had to do something like that?
      - Do you have a word or phrase you might call that?
      - Do you consider the 6 digit number to be part of signing in? Or is it different?
         - Can you tell me a bit more about your thoughts on this?
- Let’s think about the process of creating an account for a site like a bank or health care organization that has important personal information about you. Sometimes they’ll ask you to prove who you are. For example, they might have you answer questions about your credit history, or where you’ve lived in the past. Some sites might ask you to send a picture of your ID. Have you ever done anything like this before while creating an account?
   - Do you have a word or phrase you might call this process?
- Imagine that your bank [IF THEY PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ONLINE BANKING, otherwise use “the VA”],said that you needed to set up a new sign in that would be more secure.
   - If you were working for the [BANK or VA] and trying to tell someone about this new type of sign in, what might you call it? Or how might you describe it in a few words?
   - [PROMPT] Would you think of this as an upgraded account?
- Let’s switch it up a little. I’d like for you to think about two specific words. “Authenticate” and “verify”. What similarities or differences do you think about with these two words?
   - [PROMPT] Do they mean different things to you? Or would you use them to talk about the same kind of thing?

### Things to watch for:
- How the participant thinks about these terms
- Are there any nuances?
- Is there any confusion?

## Round 3: VA account use questions | 10 minutes

Let’s think more specifically about accessing the VA on your phone

- How often would you say that you use a phone to go online to manage your VA benefits or VA healthcare?
   - [IF SPLIT mobile/desktop] Are there certain things you are more likely to do on your phone?
   - Are there things you’re more likely to do on a computer?
      - [either desktop or laptop]
- If I asked you to use your phone to sign into your VA account online, how would you get there?
   - [PROMPT: maybe MHV? Or VA.gov? Or eBenefits? Or the VA phone app?]
   - Is [ANOTHER VA PORTAL] a place you visit?
      - Do you ever sign in there?
   - [IF NOT ALREADY MENTIONED] Do you ever use the VA smart phone app?
      - [IF YES] When you go to the VA online while on your mobile phone, would you say you tend to use the VA app more or the web version more?
   - I’m interested in why you [DO or DON’T] go to different places for the VA online.
   - Is there a word or phrase that you might use to call all these different VA places online?
      - [NOTE: DON’T specifically say “VA digital tools” here, save further discussion about this in Round 4]
- When was the last time you remember signing into your [VA account online]?
   - And are you comfortable telling me why you signed in that day? Like what were you trying to do then?
   - Do you remember what webpage or web address you used at that time?
      - [PROMPT: maybe VA.gov or maybe My HealtheVet (myhealth.va.gov) or the VA app?]
   - How did you sign in to the VA that time?
      - [PROMPT or screen share for MHV - there are 3 options…]
      - [PROMPT or screen share for VA.gov - there are 4 options…]
   - Do you have a particular reason that you use this sign in method?
- [IF recent sign in was into MHV]
   - Are there times when you go to VA.gov to sign into your account?
   - [IF YES] Which of the sign in choices would you say use most often
      - [PROMPT or screen share DS login, My HealtheVet login, Login.gov, or ID.me]
   - Do you ever use another option?
      - [IF YES] Can you tell me about when you would choose to log in this way?
- [IF USES MULTIPLE PORTALS] Do you use the same sign in option for VA.gov, MHV, and eBenefits?
- What do you tend to do the most often when signing into the VA online?
- Is there anything else you want to share with me about signing into your VA account online, before we move on?


## Round 4: Modal task - 10 minutes

I’d like for us to now take a look at a prototype. This is a website design that we are thinking about using. It will look like VA.gov but this is not real, and everything might not work like you are used to. Your thoughts and ideas about this will help us know how we can make it better.

I’m going to sign into this Zoom call from my phone, so I can share the design as you might see it from a phone. It will look like another person is joining this session, but it’s just me.

[SCREEN SHARE, [the prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/8vobVoSl1UqLnXsni3rcvO/Login.gov-Adoption%3A-Design-Flows?node-id=1375-5590&scaling=scale-down&page-id=944%3A3979) at this point, from your phone]

[IF ANY ISSUE WITH PHONE SHARE - screen share the mobile design from computer]

- Hopefully this looks familiar like what you would see on VA.gov from your phone?
- Let's say you were going to sign into your account to [PRIOR MENTIONED TASK or “refill a prescription”].
   - What would you do next
   - And which option would you select here?
- Can you describe for me what you see now?
   - If this popped up here while you were actually signing in, what would you do next?
      - [PROMPT: maybe close it right away? Or read through it?]
   - [STOP SCREEN SHARE or otherwise hide the modal while answering]
   - I’m hiding that screen from view for a moment, because right now I’m mostly interested in your first immediate thought.
   - Did you get a chance to see any words on the last screen that was up?
   - Do any questions or thoughts immediately come to your mind with what you had time to see of the text? 
      - If none, that's fine too
- Would you expect anything to happen if you ignore this particular popup?
   - [PROMPT] could you miss out on something? Would you get more notifications about this if it’s important? Would those notifications come in different places?
   - Have you gotten a popup before, right as you log into your account - either VA or another site?
      - How closely do you usually read a pop up like this?
      - Do you generally ignore those?
      - What if it shows up again the next time you sign in?
         - If that's happened in the past, did you still ignore it?
     - Other than right as you sign in, would there be a better place or time for this to come up for you?
        - Why would this be a point for you to see this?
- I’ll give you some time to look through this now. Try to spend as much time as you would if you were actually signing into your account here. Let me know when you are good.

[WAIT AS NEEDED]

- Do any questions come to your mind now that you’ve looked through it a little more?
- If you were describing this to a friend or family member, what would you tell them this information means?
- Now that you’ve read this, what would you do?
   - Is getting a new sign in something you would consider doing after reading this?
- How do you feel about the information that's presented here, on this screen?
   - How do you feel about this account option listed?
   - Have you heard of it?
   - What would you expect to happen if you go through with signing up for Login.gov?
      - [PROMPT] What is your understanding of what this change means for you
      - [PROMPT] Would you expect all the information you want to see online with VA remain the same?
- If instead of showing one account option here, if instead we said something like “The VA has two account options that meet our security standards” and showed you both choices, what would you think?
   - How would you choose which to go with?
- Do you have any questions for me at this point?
- Do you have any questions about any of these questions or tasks that we’ve worked through today?

### Things to watch for:
- Is the participant compelled to leave their legacy credential?
- Is there confusion around any terms?
- Are there any nuances?
- Is there any confusion?


## Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on VA.gov to make sure it works for Veterans.

Lastly, Perigean is who set up the scheduling with you - they will get you set up with the thank you stipend. They will also send you information that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to give them the chance to participate in future research.

Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

### Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says **Share** (phone) or **Share Screen** (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says **Share**. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" or your web browser.
  - *(on a phone)* You will be asked to select what you'd like to share. Please choose "Screen" and then "Start now". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help _(give permission > accessibility settings > find Zoom > check box)_.
  - Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

### Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says **Chat**. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red **Stop Share** button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the **Chat** button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - Phone: On the far right is a **More** button or **3 dots**. Tap that and then on Chat or the conversation bubble. 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

## Emergency Exit

[In the rare case of an emergency during a session, be prepared with an [emergency exit strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/Research-Safety-and-Emergency-Exit-Strategies.2143649793.html#ResearchSafetyandEmergencyExitStrategies-Sampleexitstrategies). Plan to include here at least one option, so its easy to find during a session. Take some time to practice so it feels more comfortable.]

- I really appreciate you taking some time with us today. I have now covered all the questions we have for you. Thank you so much for your time and feedback.

OR
- I am so sorry, but the prototype we wanted to test with you today is having a glitch and we aren’t going to be able to use that. Unfortunately, we’ll need to end the session. I apologize for that, but I appreciate your willingness to help us on this.
