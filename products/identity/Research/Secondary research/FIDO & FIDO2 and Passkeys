#Introduction
The ever-increasing number of accounts that users have to manage are burdening factors, as users frequently forget their passwords, resulting in losing access to their accounts.


##Passkeys
- Passkeys refer only to WebAuthn/FIDO credentials, and not to the many other keys and protocols, such as PIV, OTP, or OpenPGP Card, available in the YubiKey 5 Series.
Any passwordless FIDO credential is a passkey. 
Passkeys are a password replacement that provide faster, easier, and more secure sign-ins to websites and apps across a user’s devices. 

Unlike passwords, passkeys are resistant to phishing, are always strong, and are designed so that there are no shared secrets.

They simplify account registration for apps and websites, are easy to use, work across all of a user’s devices, and even other devices within physical proximity.

From a technical standpoint, passkeys are FIDO credentials that are discoverable by browsers or housed within native applications or security keys for passwordless authentication. 

Passkeys replace passwords with cryptographic key pairs for phishing-resistant sign-in security and an improved user experience. The cryptographic keys are used from end-user devices (computers, phones, or security keys) for user authentication.

Passkeys that are managed by phone or computer operating systems are automatically synced between the user’s devices via a cloud service. The cloud service also stores an encrypted copy of the FIDO credential. 

Single-device passkeys : Designed to be available only from a single device from which they cannot be copied. For example, a physical security key could contain multiple single-device passkeys.

Synced passkeys : Passkeys that are synced between user’s devices via a cloud service.

Device-bound passkeys : Those that never leave a single device (including those on UAF apps).
