## What we do
We are working to develop and maintain aspects of the VSP Ecosystem related to identity.  This includes how users access VA services (sign-on page), transition between those services (Single Sign-On), and maintain the security of their identity (authentication with things like MPI).

## What we're working on right now
Our current goals as a Product organization are to implement Login.gov, conduct research on how users access VA services, transition users from legacy sign-on credentials to more modern ones, and explore additional options for allowing users access to VA.gov and the VA ecosystem.

**Login.gov**
We are currently working on our remaining items to prepare for Login.gov rollout.  There will be further work as our partners complete their work on things like Single Sign-Out

**Transitioning users of legacy credentials to modern ones**
Our goal is to transition users of legacy credentials such as MyHealtheVet to more modern ones, such as Login.gov and ID.me.  Our preliminary work will focus on establishing proper messaging and channels for users to help understand why they choose the credentials they do, and how we can best guide them to a newer credential that matches their needs.  

**Sign-in Service**
We are researching providing a sign-in service for non-SSO VA applications and products, to further streamline user access to tools such as the VA.gov mobile application
