## What we do
We are responsible for identity-related work within the VSP ecosystem.  Broadly, this includes things like SSO, providing a unified sign-in page, working with other governmental agencies and offices to ensure user experience as it relates to identity is optimal, and helping other VSP teams troubleshoot issues within our purview.

### Sprint Cadence
We (generally) work on a 2-week sprint schedule.  Effective Sprint 70 (1/17/2022) our sprints will start and end on Wednesdays, in-line with the braoder VSP program.

### Working Hours
Team working hours are between 7AM EST and 9PM EST (Team members are expected to do the bulk of their work between these hours, as we are spread across multiple time zones.  Team members are **not** expected to work more than a normal 8-hour day).

### PTO
Please let Nick know at least 2 weeks in advance of any planned PTO.  Generally there will be a Slack thread in the #VSP_Identity_Internal channel at the beginning of each sprint asking for planned PTO.  

### Meeting Schedule 
**Planning/Status/Retro**: Every Monday at 3:30 EST  
**Standups**: Tuesday/Thursday at 3PM EST and Slackup on Friday  
**Scoping**: Wednesday at 4:00 EST
