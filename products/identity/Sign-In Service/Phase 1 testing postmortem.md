# Description
This document exists to capture feedback from our initial test of our Sign-in Service on VA.gov. Relevant test details as follows:  
**Test Start:** 1200EST  
**Test End:**  1800EST  
**Total Users Impacted:**  4,560 (50% of expected)   
**Success Rate:**  65.58%  
**Return Rate:**  76.35%  
**Notes:**  Success rate was negatively impacted by DSLogon issues 

## Went well:
- No critical issues. 
- Minor Issues identified and resolved quickly. 
- Team did an excellent job preparing  
- Monitoring and tools were set up well ahead of time.  
- Datadog was a standout versus Loki.   
- Team was available for monitoring and issue resolution. 
- Able to account for 100% of users going through our system.  
- Quickly identified DSLogon issue, reached out to ID.me, and put a fix in place.  In old (IAM) system, this likely would have taken weeks to months.  We resolved in 4 hours.  This dramatically reduces the impact on users due to quick fixes.  We are also able to notify users of issues/resolution.
