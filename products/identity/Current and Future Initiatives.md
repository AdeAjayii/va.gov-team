# Identity
Welcome to the Identity folder. This directory contains information about user identity on Va.gov. You'll find documentation on things like login, personalization, profile, and more.

## Current Team Objectives


### Sign-in Service Pilot  
_Current Status:_ Actively working on this.  Currently performing testing.
We are working to stand up a new sign-in service for VA.gov, and ultimately other VA and .gov properties.  The goal is to replace the existing SSOe solution with a newer, faster, and more cost-effective solution built on modern, scalable technologies.  We are currently performing initial tests of our web-based Sign-in Service, as well as working with the VA.go mobile team to implement the service within their app.  Our target for the mobile app is to begin limited user testing in September.

**Key Information**
- Our new service is built and on VA.gov, however we use flippers to enable/disable it for testing
- Most recent tests for 10% and 30% of VA.gov users went well, documentation is available in the Sign-in Service Directory
- Limiting factor is that our sign-in service does not work with outbound SSO.  Users coming _to_ VA.gov from elsewhere will be automatically signed in, but users going from VA.gov to other properties such as MHV will have to sign in again.
- Our service offers improvements in both sign-in time and issue resolution time over the existing service.

**What's next**
- Flagship mobile rollout: We will need to support this team as they roll our Sign-in Service out.
- VA.gov rollout: We would like to permanently shift 30% of user traffic on VA.gov to our service.  This will help us identify and resolve any issues, and provide us with valuable data.
- Partner rollout: Bringing other VA properties such as MHV onto our sign-in service will add SSO functionality 
- Terms and Conditions: The VA is working to roll out unified terms and conditions, we want to implement this in our sign-in service.  See the Terms and Conditions item below for more details.

**Why does it matter?**  
The existing system (IAM/ISAM) is built on older technology.  It provides a less than ideal user experience due to issues with certain browsers, long sign-in times, and a high cost to the VA.  Additionally, it is an opaque system where we are reliant on a third-party (IAM) for any fixes.  Our sign-in service is built on a modern technology stack, offers improved performance and significant cost savings, as well as allowing for future development and easy resolution of issues.  

### Inherited Proofing  
_Current Status:_ Researching and waiting for partners.
We are working to support inherited proofing for users of legacy CSP's such as DSLogon and MyHealtheVet, so that they are able to transition to a newer, more secure CSP such as Login.gov or ID.me.  Presently, we have finished several rounds of user research covering accessibility as well as general user sentiment and understanding.  We have created our initial back-end work and are waiting for our Login.gov partners to implement their work so that we can plan user pilots.

**Key Information**
- Our current line of thought is to only offer users the ability to transition to Login.gov.
- Users, by and large, understand the process and reasoning for this transition.

**Why does it matter?**  
Due to recent (2020) executive orders, legacy CSP's such as My HealtheVet and DSLogon are destined to be depreciated.  The goal of the VA is to migrate these users to a modern CSP (primarily Login.gov) prior to the deadline (TBD).  

### Terms and Conditions
_Current Status:_ Waiting for the OCC team running this to decouple from Cerner.  This will allow the solution to be implemented with the current SSOe workflow, as well as our upcoming sign-in service.
