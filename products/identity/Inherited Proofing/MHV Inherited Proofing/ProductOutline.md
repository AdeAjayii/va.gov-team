## Overview


## Problem Statement
**As a** VA.gov user
**I want** to use modern, secure Credential Service Providers (CSPs)
**So that** I can ensure that my information is safe when accessing VA services.

As we continue to evolve the VA.gov ecosystem,legacy Credential Service Providers (CSP's) do not meet customer experience and security objectives prioritized by the administration in the EO on improving customer experience.  We need to migrate users to newer CSP's that do meet these objectives.  In this specific instance, we are working to move select MyHealtheVet Premium users to Login.gov without the need to reverify their identities.
 
## Desired User Outcomes

Eligible users should be able to easily move their verified identity from MHV to Login.gov.

## Undesired User Outcomes

Eligible users are unable to easily complete the migration process.

## Desired Business Outcomes

It is a desire that all of eligible MHV users have migrated to Login.gov by December, 2022

## Undesired Business Outcomes

Eligible users are still utilizing MHV as a CSP after December, 2022
