# Research Goals
_First, set the context of this research by explaining how it fits into the Veteran’s journey. Explain what a Veteran might do before and after using this tool. What moments does this tool live in? Are there moments that matter to keep in mind? What are Veteran’s familiarity with tools like this? (do they use tools like this, or is this something new)._
_[See the Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)_

_Then, describe your goals for this research_

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#research-goals)_

Our goal is to make the login experience more accessible for low vision and no vision users. Specifically, the goal of this study is to find any issues or pain points when using a screen reader to log in to VA.gov.

* Discover how users navigate the login portion of our new login page
* Discover any inconsistencies regarding the current design of the login page i.e. pain points for our users
* Being able to test the efficiency of the current login page. Finding measurements.



# Research Questions


* How long would a user who is new to assisted technology take to get through the sign-in process?
* How long would a user who is familiar with assisted technology take to get through the sign-in process?
* What sort of pain points are not addressed before sign-in?
* How often does a veteran who uses assistive technology access VA.gov?
* What operating systems or devices are mostly used with assisted technology? What do the user groups prefer?
* What usability issues does the design of the sign-in modal present for Veterans using assistive technology?
* What technical issues are they encountering?
* What tasks do they typically log in for?

# Methodology 



We chose to conduct a remote moderated user intereviews in which we observed participates using their AT. Using Zoom we were able to record the sessions as well as the user's screen. 

We chose this method in order to: 
* Observe how users navigate the login page using a screen reader.
* Observe where users are having difficulty in different areas of the login experience.
* Ask returning users to evaluate this experience vs the previous experience.


# Hypotheses and Conclusions

_Hypotheses or tasks for this research along with the conclusions you found If you conducted a usability test, list the success or task completion rate._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#hypotheses-and-conclusions)_

_Hypothesis statement_

_("Maybe True", “Likely True”, “Definitely True”, “Likely False”, “Definitely False” or “Not enough information”) Why?_


# Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._

_[See an example](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/find-a-va-form/post-mvp-releases/research/research-findings.md#key-findings)_

1. Most participants noted having multiple credential providers they signed in using My HealtheVet the most
2. Sign-in took approximately five to ten minutes to complete
3. Half of the participants acknowledged giving/receiving assistance from others when accessing VA.gov  
4. Most participants stated that they would typically start the sign-in process from My HealtheVet or E-benefits rather than VA.gov
	- Often completing tasks having to do with checking claims, messaging providers, or checking the status of medication
5. Most participants would spend twenty minutes to one hour on VA.gov looking through content, checking on prescriptions, or using secure messaging.
6. Most participants that use assistive technology are intermediate-level users.
7. Most Zoom and Magnify users find different methods for their assistive tech
	- Some users used large TV screens or monitors
8. Most Screen Reader users find that there is too much information per page (after login).
	- Mostly, users will let the screen readers read the whole page before interacting with the content
9. For some Screen Reader users the content is repetitive and informs them to log in again.
10. When users find it difficult to log in, they turn to different sites and applications
11. Most participants knew who to contact when there were technical issues with VA.gov or their AT.
	- Outside to study- Issues with password management (changes to credentials)
	- During study- Participants experience issues after the redirects in which they received error messages or were directed elsewhere (AccessVA)
12. Significant usability issues:
	- Not confirming if the user has made mistakes in logon (Screen Readers)
	- Using images for CAPTCHA (Screen Readers) (DS Logon)
	- Small fonts (Zoom and Magnify)
	- PDFs downloaded from VA.gov do not work with assistive technology
13. Prior to sign-in participants experienced pain points around multifactor authentication.
	- Screen readers take time to tab through and users could be timed out before they finish a task.



# Details of Findings 

_For each finding, list details with supporting quotes and images when possible. Please **add relevant keywords/labels to your findings** selected from the [research repository label list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/labels?page=1&sort=name-asc).
