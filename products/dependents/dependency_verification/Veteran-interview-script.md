# Veteran Interview Conversation Guide

Hello! My name is [researcher name]. I’m an employee at Veterans Affairs, and we are working on a project to make it easier for Veterans to tell Veterans Affairs about any changes in the people that are financially dependent on them. For example, things like getting married, having a baby, or adopting a child. Would it be okay if I ask you some questions about those topics, so that Veterans Affairs can make it as simple as possible to keep that information up to date?

We’d like to record this interview for research purposes, but once we are done with that research, this recording will be deleted. Would it be alright if we record this conversation?

## (Introduction)
Tell me briefly about your service. 

## (Part 1: Questions to inform flow and intercept design)
When was the last time you visited VA.gov?

What did you go to VA.gov to do? 

Did you need to log in? 

When logging in, how would you feel about being asked to verify the information about your depends? 

What are other ways that you might do business with VA that may be good opportunity to remind you to update their dependents’ information?

## (Part 2: Questions related to benefits and dependents) 
Are you receiving VA benefits?

Do you have any dependents? 

What information would you need to see to verify that VA has accurate information about your dependents? For example, what would you like to see on a list as it relates to your dependents to confirm this information?

(Co-design example together with shared screen)

The number and kind of dependents you have figure into the calculation of certain VA benefits. 

When making a change to the status of your dependents, what questions would you like answered? 

What’s the best way for you to learn how those dependents would affect those benefits? For example, once your children turned 18, how or where would you expect to learn about the effect on your benefits? 

We know that sometimes a benefit status change might happen as the result of a sensitive issue. If that status of your dependents changed to to a life change that might be sensitive or upsetting, how would you like VA to ask you about that? 

## (Part 3: Questions about overpayment)
If you are overpaid for a benefit because the VA doesn’t have accurate information about your dependents, you can end up owing the VA money. We want to avoid that any way possible. 

If your benefits had been overpaid as a result of a change in the status of your dependents, how would you like to find about that?

## (Part 4: Closing questions)
Is there anything else that we didn’t discuss regarding the relationship between your dependents and your benefits that you think we should be aware of? 

Do you have any questions for me about this work?
