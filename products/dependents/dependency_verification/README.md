## Overview
Veterans are required to update their dependents every 8 years through a paper 21P-686c form that is mailed to them with a letter explaining the requirement. Veterans can also view, add, and remove their dependents on VA.gov by utilizing an online version of the 686c form. Veterans can also fill out an online 21-674 form to Request Approval of School Attendance when claiming benefits for a child who is at least 18 years old, but under 23, and attending school. The 686c and 674 online forms appear as one integrated experience, but VA.gov generates two seperate pdf forms when the online data is submitted.

## Problem Statement
Currently, updating dependency information outside of the 8-year requirement is voluntary, and the burden to remember to make dependency updates falls on the Veteran. This results in a very low quality feedback loop of what dependents are intended to be on award, which has contributed to $250 million in annual benefit overpayments.

## Desired User Outcomes

- Veteran's can quickly, easily and regulary update the VA on their dependents' status' so that they aren't being overpaid or underpaid.
- The VA will save close to $250 M a year in overpayments.
- Congressional obligations will be met.

## Undesired User Outcomes
- Veterans ignore the email and another type of intercept would be needed.

## Desired Business Outcomes
- The VA will save close to $250 M a year in overpayments.
- Veterans receive the benefits they are entitled to.
- Congressional obligations will be met.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Domo or Google Analytics Dashboards/Reports_
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* Effectively at 0%

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

- Objective: More Veterans have verified that their dependents are correct, or have the option to correct them.
  - Key result: Percentage comparison of annual updates compared to total (0%+)
  - Key result: Conversion rate from opening email to viewing "view dependents" page (>50%)
  - Key result: Reduced annual overpayment (<$100m)

   - Launched: TBD 

--- 


### Key Decisions
- A [pop-up modal](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/ebenefits/dependency-verification/modal) to prompt Veterans to update their dependent information was developed for VA.gov in 2021, but it was considered too disruptive to the VA.gov experience, so it not launched.
