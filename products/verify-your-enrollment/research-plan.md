# Research Plan for VFS, VYE-Verify Your Enrollment, November 2023

## Background
[VYE Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/verify-your-enrollment/product-outline.md)

**What problem is your product trying to solve?**
WAVE is currently non-compliant because it uses JavaScript, which is no longer sanctioned by the U.S. goverment because of data security concerns. This is a problem because WAVE holds Veterans' personally identifiable information.

**Where is your product situated on VA.gov? (ex: auth vs. unauth)**
WAVE is currently a standalone application being linked to from VA.gov. The new VYE tool is an authenticated tool that should sit under the "Education and training" section of the "VA Benefits and Health Care" menu.

**What is Veterans’ familiarity with this tool? Is this a new product or an iteration on an existing one?**
Verify Your Enrollment is replacing the WAVE tool which has been in existence in its current state since 2003. Veterans utilizing education benefits through the MGIB-Active Duty (Chapter 30), MGIB Selected Reserve (Chapter 1606), Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP, Chapter 1607), or Veterans Retraining Assistance Program (VRAP) currently verify their benefits with WAVE.

### OCTO Priorities 

Modernizing WAVE and moving it to VA.gov aligns with OCTO-DE's mission to update VA applications, create the best experience for all Veterans by streamlining the process to receive education benefits, and provide a seamless Veteran experience through the delivery of state-of-the-art technology by improving the functionality and experience of the application.

### Veteran Journey
VYE fits in the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) in numerous phases and has meaningful moments, such as: 
- Serving: Managing military and family obligations
- Getting out: Engaging VA to access benefits and services
- Starting up: Finding something to do
- Reinventing myself: Acquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials
- Putting down roots: Taking care of my family
- Putting down roots: Engaging VA to access benefits and services

## Research Goals and Questions	
**Evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed solution**
- Are our perceptions of Veterans goals accurate (e.g., verification #1, checking history #2, managing profile #3, etc.)?
- Is our proposed design simple for Veterans to use to accomplish their goals?
- Are Veterans able to quickly and easily verify their enrollment? 
- Do Veterans need additional touchpoints (e.g., emails) in order to accomplish their goals?
- Is our two-page proposed design sufficient for users to easily find their desired information?
- Can users easily update their address and direct deposit information?
- Is the label, "Your Benefits Profile" sufficient to communicate the types of information contained in the profile? 

**Evaluate our place in the VA.gov system**
- Are there other messages before or after interaction with VYE that our Veterans need?
- How do our Veterans find VYE (e.g., email link, Google search, onsite search, navigation menus, etc.)?
- How effective are these channels to Veterans for finding VYE/WAVE?
- Would Veterans prefer to verify their enrollment over the phone or via text? 

**What might we be missing in our understanding of our Veterans?**
- Are they confused by the process of enrollment and how that information is communicated to the VA for verification?
- Do they need more insight into backoffice processes (e.g., pending documents and processes)?

### Outcome
Evaluative findings will immediately affect the design and content of our MVP solution for VYE. 

Additional generative research will help inform future solutions and enhancements to VYE (e.g., email notifications, IVR, text verification, integration with VA.gov profile, etc.). 

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

**The new VYE design will provide a much simpler process for Veterans to manage their enrollment verifications as compared to the overly complicated WAVE tool.** 
- WAVE is challenging to navigate and use. 
- A more streamlined and succint design will be sufficient for Veterans to manage their enrollment verifications.
- In-context design clues will remove the need for complex user guides.
- User do not need to see backoffice processes that are currently contained in "Pending Documents."

**Veterans will be able to easily find and access the VYE application.**
- Existing processes are sufficient to bring Veterans needing to verify enrollment to the VYE tool (e.g., email prompts, Google search, onsite search, etc.).
- Veterans might prefer IVR or text-based verification processes for managing enrollment. 

**There are things we don't know about our Veterans.**
- We do not have documented research on our users and are anticipating learnings to come from open-ended conversation.  

## Methodology	
Describe the method you’re planning. You should be able to explain why this method is appropriate for the goals of the research and maturity of the design. 

Examples of common research methods include: 
- Semi-structured interviews - appropriate for generative research
- Contextual inquiry - appropriate for generative research
- Card sorts - appropriate for generative and evaluative research; depending on the study design 
- Tree tests - appropriate for evaluative research
- Usability testing - appropriate for evaluative research
- User acceptance testing (UAT) - required before product release

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/recruiting-participants) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, accessibility specialist, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:
- Accessibility specialist (for sessions where support for assistive technology may be needed):	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work.** Spread observers across sessions so that there are no more than 5-6 total attendees (moderator, notetaker(s), observer(s)) per session on the VA side
