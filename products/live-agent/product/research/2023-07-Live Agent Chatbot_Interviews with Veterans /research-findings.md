## Research Goals

The Thoughtworks team (in partnership with VES, Seamless CX leaders, and VA Call Center stakeholders) are exploring how integrations of chat-based Live Agent services may enhance and enable the experiences of Veterans and their caregivers while interacting with the VA.

The need for assistance and clarity from the VA can happen at any time for a Veteran. Veterans and their caretakers have the option of contacting the VA by phone or through VA.gov. The Live Agent chat is a part of the Veteran’s user journey as a way in which a Veteran may interact with a VA representative. It allows fod an additional method of communication.

The Thoughtworks team is looking to gather and review existing research and data and conduct interviews with Live Agents and Veterans. Through interviews with Veterans we are hoping to understand their experiences, pain points, and recommendations for improving interactions with text-based live agents and enhancements to the systems or technology.

The goal is to learn about gaps and areas to optimize from Veterans to inform recommendations for best practices for how to integrate chat-based Live Agent communications across different departments at the VA and to develop recommendations for effective and successful interactions between a Veteran (or their caregiver) and a Live Agent.

* Understand how Veterans and their families would want to leverage a chat experience, how it works for them today [in the VA and outside of the VA], and in what instances they would not want to use a chat experience.

* Map out what a Veteran’s experience journey would look like if they were to leverage a live chat experience; considering the different archetypes and variance in the problems to be solved, what does the happy path look like?

## Research Questions

* What are the reasons why Veterans and their caregivers reach out to the VA for resources? What are the positive and negative aspects they experience when sourcing information through text-based chat with a Live Agent? 
* Where is there room for improvement in text-based chat interactions with VA Live Agents? What would indicate a successful experience

## Methodology 

We conducted a lean qualitative study to understand how Veterans and Contact Center Live Agents experience live chat. We combined the ‘Jobs to be Done’ methodology with qualitative interview methods. Enabling us to build journey maps and pinpoint the positive and negative moments along the Veterans and Contact Center Live Agent journey. These journey highlights will help us prioritize the areas for further analysis in phase 2. 

We spoke to a limited number of Veterans due to time constraints on the engagement duration, but through the lean principle of diminishing returns, meaning from even just speaking to 5 participants, you may learn the same number of insights as compared to interviewing 30; however, the larger number would enable you to validate your learnings. As such, we recommend validating the learnings found here as part of phase two. 


## Hypotheses and Conclusions

H1: There will be some consistency across each Veteran’s journey in how they reach out for help to find information from the VA
   * Definitely True; Veterans contacted VA through a similar process and through similar channels.

H2: There will be a number of challenges Veterans experience in regards to effectively sourcing information or resources that they need
   * Definitely True; Veterans voiced a number of obstacles with communicating with VA (long wait times, siloed VA departments)

H3: There will be some scenarios where text-based chat works really well and others where it is not an ideal channel to use to solve a specific problem or issue.
   * Definitely Tue; Veterans prefer communicating through chat for most issues, but prefer other methods of communciation for certain scenarios, such as medical care.

## Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here.

Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._
