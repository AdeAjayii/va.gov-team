# Documentation Style Guide Release Plan 

- Product: Documentation Site ([product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/documentation-site/product-outline.md))
- Feature: Documentation Style Guide ([super epic](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/10006))

## Phase I: moderated production testing

### Planning:

As Phase 1 of our release, we are sending the drafted style guide to VSP leadership for feedback. We're taking this approach because we assume that VSP (in fact, our team) will be the heaviest users of the style guide.

- Date range: VSP Sprints 27 & 28 (June 2020)
- Number of users: ~5
- How you'll recruit: VSP leadership/Slack message
- How you'll test and give access: Drafted style guide is in a google doc

### Results:

- Number of users: 
- Number of issues identified/fixed: 
- Types of errors: 
- Any UX changes necessary? 
- If yes, what: 

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing

### Planning

- Date range: until June 30, 2020
- How you'll test and give access: Publish style guide in `va.gov-team` GitHub repo, socialize (via Slack) with VSP only
- Success criteria: 
  - VSP references the style guide & finds it useful (qualitative data - Slack)
  - If terms are added to word list, 85% of additions follow documented process and no words are introduced that conflict with other words or definitions on the list

### Results: 

- Number of users: 
- Number of issues identified/fixed: 
- Types of errors: 
- Any UX changes necessary?
- If yes, what: 
- Success criteria: 
  - Did VSP members reference and find it useful? 
  - Were any terms added to word list?
