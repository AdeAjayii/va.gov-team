# Documentation Site: Product Outline

## Overview
The documentation site is the single source of truth for team, product, and platform information required by teams building veteran-facing services on VA.gov.  Currently, VFS-facing documentation exists on a variety of tooling solutions and code repositories, all loosely consolidated by [The Home Page MVP](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va.gov-team/) and [The Gatsby Site](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/). 

## Problem Statement 

We created a myriad of documentation that was designed to help our customers (i.e. VFS teams building things on VA.gov) find what they need to work seamlessly and iteratively, and build great products on VA.gov. We have observed that the resources as they exist today arenâ€™t effectively enabling that, which is causing a large support burden for VSP, is frustrating our customers, and is potentially resulting in products on VA.gov that don't meet VSP standards. 

On 2020-09-15, VSP finalized acquisition of Confluence.  Confluence will be able to address these challenges, but there is a lot of work to be done between acquisition and global release.

_HMW leverage Confluence to improve the findability of documentation for VFS teams?_

## Personas
* VFS team members


## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Number of support requests
* VSF sentiment around navigating and consuming Confluence content
* Placeholder: (Explore what analytics Confluence has built in that we can leverage)[https://confluence.atlassian.com/confeval/confluence-evaluator-resources/confluence-analytics-statistics]
  * To investigate if covered by Confluence analytics: Time spent finding documentation, or number of clicks needed to find desired documentation
 
#### Baseline KPI Values
- To be gathered: VSF sentiment around navigating and consuming current VSP content


## Assumptions

* Building out Confluence will lead to greater self-service and fewer support requests.
* Confluence will be easier for VFS teams to navigate and surface the resources they are looking for.
* The VSP team will be able to customize Confluence without undue burden.
 
## Solution Approach
We will start with two sub-initiatives (unprioritized):

Defining what pilot parameters would be.  Methodology to come.
Familiarizing ourselves with Confluence from a baseline user and an admin user perspective
