# Confluence Documentation: Product Outline

## Overview
VA.gov platform documentation (aka "VFS-facing documentation") houses platform, team, product, and development information for VA.gov application teams (aka "VFS teams").  Currently, platform documentation exists on a variety of tooling solutions and code repositories, all loosely consolidated by [The Home Page MVP](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va.gov-team/) and [The Gatsby Site](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/).

## Problem Statement 

VSP has created a myriad of documentation to help our customers (i.e. VFS teams) work seamlessly and iteratively to build great products.  However, platform documentation is a not easily navigable and frequently not actionable, which:
- Causes a large support burden for VSP, therefore 
- Frustrating our customers, and 
- Potentially resulting in products on VA.gov that don't meet VSP standards. 

On 2020-09-15, VSP finalized acquisition of Confluence.  Confluence will be able to address these challenges, but there is a lot of work to be done between acquisition and global release.

_HMW leverage Confluence to improve the findability of documentation for VFS teams?_

## Personas
* VFS designers and content writers
* VFS developers
* VFS PMs and POs

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Volume of support requests
* Complexity of support given
* VSF sentiment around navigating and consuming Confluence content
* Placeholder: [Explore what analytics Confluence has built in that we can leverage](https://confluence.atlassian.com/confeval/confluence-evaluator-resources/confluence-analytics-statistics)
  * To investigate if covered by Confluence analytics: Time spent finding documentation, or number of clicks needed to find desired documentation
 
#### Baseline KPI Values
- VSF sentiment around current platform documentation: [MURAL board](https://app.mural.co/t/adhocvetsgov9623/m/adhocvetsgov9623/1587506427611/4fb63eb007eadec05ce8634499699ff610706a7d)

## Assumptions

* Building out Confluence will lead to greater self-service and fewer support requests.
* Confluence will be easier for VFS teams to navigate and surface the resources they are looking for.
* The VSP team will be able to customize Confluence without undue burden.
 
## Solution Approach
We will start with two sub-initiatives (unprioritized):
* Defining what pilot parameters would be.  Methodology to come.
* Familiarizing ourselves with Confluence from a baseline user and an admin user perspective
