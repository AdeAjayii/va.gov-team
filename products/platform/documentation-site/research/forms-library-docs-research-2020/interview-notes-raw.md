# Forms Library Documentation User Research Notes 

## RG - Pilot Interview 6/5/20

E: Intro notes … we won’t be on video for some of this. We want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability, we just want your input to help ensure we’re making good documentation for people who are working on VA.gov. I won’t be offended by any opinions and we welcome your feedback. If for any reason you want to stop the session just let me know. Are you comfortable if we record the 

E: Are you familiar with forms library documentation? 

RG: Intimately.

E: Tell me more, when did you last reference it? 

RG: Today. Most of the time if I need a pattern or something I’ll go straight there. Today I … I should say I use the deisgn pages a lot more to check class names and things like that bc it’s in the design docs. Other than that I don’t spend a lot of time looking at react components. I did initially when I was first learning the system. When I need a patten say a group of radio buttons … and if I try to do it any other way it’s very difficult. It’s mostly for reference now. Initially it was reading everything and trying to figure out how the system worked, now it’s for reference. 

E: what were you looking at today? 

RG: Class names and flex box, how the naming system worked. I should know the system but it always seems like I get one letter off, it’s just easier to have a reference handy. 

E: Is that info on the design site or the react site? 

RG: Design site. Sometimes I have a difficult time figuring out/remembering which site it’s on and going to one or the other. One has an “additional info” link that jumps to the right docs, I refer to that a lot. I have a huge list of all these links — the bookmarks are kind of difficult to use. They all start out VA.gov …… design system. And then you have to figure out which of your bookmarks actually apply. When you bookmark a page it uses the title. 

E: So the docs you were reading today about flex box, did that help? Was that useful? 

RG: Yes. The design system has examples for everything so it’s really helpful, it makes it really easy. 

E: Do you ever reference any supplemental docs or websites? 

RG: Sometimes if I forget how to set up a hook, etc, I have to go to react website. Once you have a form in place you don’t have to do a lot of referencing. If you’re doing maintenance you don’t need to reference a lot of stuff, but if you’re trying to add something new you may forget. 

E: Do you have any other thoughts or does anything stand out about the current forms library documentation? 

RG: I think it would be nice to have a link between the client app docs and the design docs handy at the top of the screen. Like I said there are so many links that I have saved in my browser. It might be nice with on boarding if someone already had something organized if someone already had something organized and could share their saved bookmarks and you could boom import them all. 

E: That’s super helpful for us to hear! And we welcome any other thoughts along the same lines any time. I’m going to transition into the activity that we want to do next. I’ll start by sharing my screen and going over some instructions. 

What we’re looking at here is a google doc that has a series of common examples of form components and instructions on how to fit all the parts together. You’ll notice that throughout this google doc, there are comments on the sidebar providing an additional layer of instructions providing tasks and asking for feedback. 

For the next 30ish minutes, you’ll follow the instructions in this document in the blue box and use the sidebar to add your comments throughout the document. This document is specific to you, we’ll make a copy for each new participant. Feel free to mark up the document in any way that is helpful to you. We’ll end this video call, start a timer for 30 minutes, and get us all back together when that time passes. 

There’s nothing you can do wrong here, anything you experience is helpful for us to improve these documents. 

E explains the logistics of the async activity. 

RG: Am I actually doing the thing? 

E: Read and absorb the info. 

—— BREAK FOR ASYNC ACTIVITY —— 

RG: That was quite a block of text to work through! It might have been nice to give it to me in advance so you didn’t have to take a 30 minute break. 

E: We considered giving folks a week or so continue using this and reference it in their work. What do you think about that idea? 

RG: I think a week is too long. If you say “give it a week” I’d wait until the last minute. If you say, “hey we’re going to meet in an hour and go over this” … I did get a little lost in the middle, and I scrolled down and saw that you had more comments and that was helpful. 

E: Want to get your thoughts on general reactions to this new style of documentation. Do you have any initial reactions, thoughts about it? 

RG: It seems awkward to say here, take this, take 30 minutes and then we’ll meet up again. I got lost in the middle. On the first task, I got through it and I knew how far down the page I was and all the comments ran out. Where does the first task end, and where does the second task start? That made it a little awkward. 

E: That’s really helpful. 

RG: Other than that, it seemed like it probably would’ve taken me a lot more than half an hour. I was almost at the end, just glancing over stuff. I’m familiar with some of these patterns, but then there’s others that I’m like oh I haven’t used that. I added a comment to one where the example was confusing when I first tried to use it but then once I knew how to use it I understood. 

E: That’s helpful! We’ll take a look at the comments and things that you left in the document. Is there … in your quick skim through the rest of it, did it seem like there were comprehensive examples? Is there anything that jumped out at you as a gap or that was missing? Not in the activity part but in the code examples, the recipe style examples. 

RG: I think this would’ve helped a lot better if you said “here’s your design, what would you do to implement this” I could have a general idea of where to look and what to look for. Maybe it would’ve been better to have the code first. I don’t know, it was weird and awkward. The example, I was like … if it’s an array, why is validator a key? I don’t know. Some of the code examples just threw me off too. 

Other than that, I guess … it all made … I’ve seen all these patterns before and it makes sense with the way we have it set up. Some things could be different, but I don’t know. 

E: Does this read as different than the documentation that’s currently on the react site? 

RG: It is different because … I think in the document it actually says … it’s all organized like, these are all radio buttons, ok what can I do with radio buttons, I can group them, I can create my own custom one. It all fits together that way, it’s kind of nice to have it organized like that. I guess because you’re just cutting out little sections it kind of threw me off, but you know, I understand. You’ll see that I got confused on the one where you asked me about radio buttons fading in. Do you want me to use expand under or a custom animation thing? But I don’t think we have any documentation on custom animation. 

E: I like the idea of having a design to help reference and to give that as a prompt. 

RG: That’s more of a day to day scenario - here’s your design, what are you going to do? It makes more sense to me that way, but others might disagree. 

E: Does anyone else on the call have questions or anything before we wrap up? 

C: How was the organization? There’s a bunch of random things thrown in there … would you organize it differently? 

RG: I wasn’t sure when I was done with the first task. It just continues on with validation and then using the update schema — which I actually haven’t ever used but I know they use it in the military address component. It seemed like it went off course from validation, all of the sudden you had update schema in there. Maybe there’s too many examples in there for this study? 

Yeah I guess that’s about it. I mean, I don’t know. [chuckles] Conditionally hide groups and pages and components … I don’t know, I think separating it out into tasks and saying “this is task 1-2” would have been helpful. 

E: Thank you so much for helping out and trying out this new style of documentation and this new style of user research!
