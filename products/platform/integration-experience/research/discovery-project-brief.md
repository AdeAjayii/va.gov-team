 [Discovery Sprint How-to](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) for details on the whole process.

## PROJECT BRIEF

### Project Name
Integration Experience

### Problem Statement / How Might We statements
 Help VFS teams more easily and quickly integrate with systems they rely on. This API posture, or strategy, will help Platform determine how to best enable a “product ownership model” where VFS teams are empowered through the technology stack. 

We will focus is on creating the model and technology for making it easy for customers to browse and integrate with VA external services / APIs.

### Project Details

* What do we know?
* What don't we know?
* Are any of the above assumptions that need to be verified?
* How are we going to find out answers? (There are tons of different methods to choose from depending on your project goals, resources, and time constraints. Checkout the methods and templates provided in the [Discovery Toolkit](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/discovery-sprints/how-to-run-discovery-sprint.md) and consult the [Research Team](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/research).)
* What kinds of users are likely to benefit from solving this problem (bonus points for our personas)?
* Who do we need to talk to (stakeholders, Veterans, MyHealtheVet Coordinators, etc.)? (Try to get a wide variety of people to get a range of perspectives – both higher ups and people on the ground doing the work. Meet with people in person whenever possible.)
* What secondary research should we do (google, facebook, internal documents)?
* Are there any intentional project constraints (things we're intentionally deeming out of scope)?
* Are there any challenges or risks that will make this discovery sprint hard to complete (tricky politics, technology complications, etc.)?
