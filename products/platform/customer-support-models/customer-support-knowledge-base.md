# Customer Support Knowledge Base

## Overview

An easily searchable repository of articles created by Platform Crew members explaining how to resolve various customer support issues.

## Problem Statement

Without a knowledge base, it is difficult for Platform Support team members to quickly resolve support requests by providing links to documentation - currently 12% of requests involve providing documentation and 61% of those still require additional support after the user receives documentation. This increases the time it takes Platform Support to provide VFS team members with what they need. It also increases the time new Platform Support team members need to onboard, as they cannot refer to documentation to learn how to respond to common support requests.

## Personas

Phase 1: Platform SREs

Phase 2: VFS teams

## Desired User Outcomes 
- Platform SREs are able to create knowledge base articles documentating how to resolve support requests.
- Platform SREs can easily reference knowledge base articles to quickly resolve support requests.
- VFS teams go to the knowledge base to find answers to their questions before contacting Platform support.
  
## Desired Business Outcomes 
- VFS teams are able to use the knowledge base to solve issues on their own.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Pageviews for knowledge base articles.
- % of support requests resolved by providing links to knowledge base articles.

#### Baseline KPI Values

------

## Assumptions

- The positive impact on the quality and efficiency of customer support interactions will be greater than burden of creating and maintaining knowledge base articles on Platform support team members.
