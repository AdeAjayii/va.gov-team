# Customer Support Knowledge Base

## Overview

An easily searchable repository of articles created by Platform team members explaining how to resolve customer support issues with speed and consistency.

## Problem Statement

Platform teams receive customer support requests of varying nature and complexity which makes it challenging to provide a consistent and efficient support experience to VFS teams.

## Personas

Phase 1: Platform SREs

Phase 2: VFS team members

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Increase in support requests referencing documentation
- Decrease of users required additional support after receiving documentation
- Decrease in time to respond to support requests

#### Baseline KPI Values

## Assumptions

- The positive impact on the quality and efficiency of customer support interactions will be greater than burden of creating and mainting  knowledge base articles on Platform support teams.

  

## Solution Approach

*Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:*

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

*For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built.*
