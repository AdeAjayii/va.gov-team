# Customer Support Knowledge Base

## Overview

An easily searchable repository of articles created by Platform Crew members explaining how to resolve various customer support issues.

## Problem Statement

Platform teams receive customer support requests of varying nature and complexity which makes it challenging to provide a consistent and efficient support experience to VFS teams.

## Personas

Phase 1: Platform SREs

Phase 2: VFS team members

## Desired User Outcomes 
- Platform SREs are able to create knowledge base articles documentating how to resolve support requests.
- Platform SREs can easily reference knowledge base articles to quickly resolve support requests.
  
## Desired Business Outcomes 
- VFS teams are able to use the knowledge base to solve issues on their own.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Increase in support requests referencing documentation
- Decrease of users required additional support after receiving documentation
- Decrease in time to respond to support requests

#### Baseline KPI Values

## Assumptions

- The positive impact on the quality and efficiency of customer support interactions will be greater than burden of creating and maintaining knowledge base articles on Platform support team members.
