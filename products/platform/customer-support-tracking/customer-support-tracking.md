# Customer Support Tracking [DRAFT]

## Overview

Currently, we don't have a good way to categorize or gather data about support requests. We've started using a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bKUfJ6GSRm7_Zal88IkYEiw5md-9L9WRxK51ZNMtt8k/edit?pli=1#gid=1793382735) to capture this data to help inform future decisions around team's capacity and roadmaps.

## Problem Statement

Without better understanding how VSP teams' time is spent on customer support work, we don't know what areas we could focus on to make improvements - such as writing documentation - that allow VFS teams to figure out their own answers or get unblocked without needing assistance from VSP.

If we had a standardized way to log customer support requests and all customer-facing VSP teams logged every support request using that process, we could use that data to identify roadmap initiatives that would give VFS teams the documentation and tools they need to successfully do their work without engaging with VSP.

## Personas

VSP team members and Leadership.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- % of customer support requests that are logged with standardized labels and fields
- % of responses to customer support requests that are automated
- time it takes to compile customer support reports

#### Baseline KPI Values

## Assumptions

- By creating a standardized process for tracking customer support requests across VSP teams, we expect to identify “problem areas” with high burdens of manual support to be prioritized in future VSP initiatives.

## Solution Approach

*Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:*

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

*For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built.*
