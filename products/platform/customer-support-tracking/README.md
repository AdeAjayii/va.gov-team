# Customer Support Tracking

## Overview

Currently, we don't have a good way to categorize or gather data about support requests. We've started using a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bKUfJ6GSRm7_Zal88IkYEiw5md-9L9WRxK51ZNMtt8k/edit?pli=1#gid=1793382735) to capture this data to help inform future decisions around team's capacity and roadmaps.

## Problem Statement

Without better understanding how VSP teams' time is spent on customer support work, we don't know what areas we could focus on to make improvements - such as writing documentation - that allow VFS teams to figure out their own answers or get unblocked without needing assistance from VSP.

If we had a standardized way to log customer support requests and all customer-facing VSP teams logged every support request using that process, we could use that data to identify roadmap initiatives that would give VFS teams the documentation and tools they need to successfully do their work without engaging with VSP.

## Who is this for?

- VSP team members
- Leadership

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- % of customer support requests that are automatically logged and tagged.
- time it takes to compile customer support reports.
- % of tracked links that go to platform documentation.
