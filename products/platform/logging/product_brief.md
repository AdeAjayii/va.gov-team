# Loki Product Brief (WIP)

### What is it?

Loki is a tool that we will be using to replace Cloudwatch as our logging solution. This will be accessed through Grafana using the SOCKS proxy. 

Loki documentation: [GitHub - grafana/loki: Like Prometheus, but for logs.](https://github.com/grafana/loki)

### How does it work?

Loki, works by using fluentd logging driver in ECS that gathers and sends logs to Loki for storing logs and processing queries. Grafana is then used for querying and displaying those logs.
