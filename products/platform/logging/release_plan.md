# Loki for logging - Release Plan (WIP)
---
## Phase I: Release and VSP testing 
---
### Planning:
- Desired date range: TBD
- Desired number of users: 2 VSP teams
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: Talk to the tools teams directly 
- How you'll conduct the testing: We will have them use the documentation we have in place and ask for feedback or comments.
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: It will be live in parallel with the old method.  Users will be able to access via Grafana which they already know how to use.

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
2. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
3. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
4. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
