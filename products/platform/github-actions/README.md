# GitHub Actions
Continuous Integration (CI) for VSP will be implemented using GitHub Actions (GHA) which allows developers to automate, customize, and execute software development workflows directly within their applicationâ€™s repository. GHA also provides an intuitive UI so that developers can easily visualize their CI workflows, and manage various stages of the testing and integration pipelines.
