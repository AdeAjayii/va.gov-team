# Google Analytics Content Grouping

## What is it?
Content groups are custom buckets within Google Analytics that allow you to more easily compare your user metrics by page title. The current functionality allows you to segment by va.gov benefit hub.

## How does it work?
Log into Google Analytics 360 and navigate to the `Behavior` dropdown on the left nav. Click on `Site Content` > `All Pages` and you can filter by `Content Grouping` > `Benefit Hubs (Content Group)` on the `Primary Dimension` bar.  

You can also click on `Secondary Dimension` and filter by `Benefit Hubs (Content Group)`.
