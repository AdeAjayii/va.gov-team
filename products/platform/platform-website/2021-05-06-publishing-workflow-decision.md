  - The ticketed work is part of the 2021 Q2 ["Develop guidelines" initiative](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/22190): Platform Website — Develop migration, publishing, and maintenance guidelines for Platform Teams #22190


## Context

The Content Team is writing roles and responsiblity and publishing workflow guidance.  Here are the options we see REGARDING XYZ.

In this discussion, "publishing workflow" means taking a draft page and making it live (viewable by VFS teams and the general public) on the Platform Website.

## Paths forward

### Option 1: Include Platform PMs in tthe publishing workflow

#### Option 1a (recommendation): Include them immediately

Add PMs to the `scroll-viewport-admins` Confluence user group right away.  This allows the us to:

they don't have to act as publishers immediately, tthey can have a transition period

- **Empower Platform teams to self-serve by creating and publishing their own docs:**  We hypothesize that...
  - Content Team not a bottleneck, faster maintenance of Platform Website

Considerations
- We'd have to do additional trainings with the PMs, esp since we said that we wanted to greater control over the publishing workflow in the [2021 Jan Scroll Viewport rec](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/platform-website/2021-01-29-scroll-viewport-decision.md)
- We'd have to be specific about where draft pages can live so they don't get mixed up


- Pros: as soon as teams have their guidelines, they can be self-sufficient in creating and publishing their docs
- Cons: Our IA and guidelines are still incomplete/rough around the edges. Letting a bunch of publishers in ASAP might be a little chaotic


#### Option 1b: Include them later (perhaps mid/end of Q3)

Add PMs to the `scroll-viewport-admins` Confluence user group after we go through a few reps with the guidance.  This allows the us to:

- **Surface initial concerns/issues with structure or publishing guidelines before letting more people loose in the admin console**: We hypothesize 
- Cons: teams have to wait to be fully self-service for (incomplete sentence)

### Option 2: Never have PMs be part of the publishing workflow

- Pros: Not many… Content team would have visibility into changes being made and could flag quality/editorial concerns 
- Cons: Teams can’t self-serve to publish. We could be a bottleneck. We’d have to work out a regular content “deployment” schedule and support it (e.g., someone from our team publishes daily at 3PM)


## Decision

To come.
