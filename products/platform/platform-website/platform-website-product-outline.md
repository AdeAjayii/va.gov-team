# Platform Website: Product Outline

## Overview
VA.gov's Platform Website houses platform, team, product, and development information for VA.gov application teams (aka "VFS teams").  Currently, documentation for the Platform Website exists on a variety of tooling solutions and code repositories, all loosely consolidated by [The Home Page MVP](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va.gov-team/) and [The Gatsby Site](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/).

## Problem Statement 

The Platform has created a myriad of documentation to help our customers work seamlessly and iteratively to build great products.  However, documentation is a not easily navigable and frequently not actionable, which:

- Causes a large support burden for Platform Teams, therefore 
- Frustrating our customers, and 
- Potentially results in products on VA.gov that don't meet Platform standards. 

_HMW enable Platform Teams to be responsible for populating and maintaining the Platform Website?_

_HMW guide Platform Teams to deprecate information on GitHub?_

## Personas
* Platform Teams
* VFS team members
  * Developers
  * PMs and POs
  * Designers and content writers

## Measuring success

### Key performance indicators (KPIs)
2021 Q2:
* Time from idea to published document
* Time from published document (written without writer involvement) to clear, actionable document (written _with_ writer involvement)
* Number of requests from Platform Teams over time, about how to populate the Platform Website

2020 Q4:
* VFS sentiment around proposed platform developer documentation

Overall:
* Volume of support requests
* Complexity of support given
* VSF sentiment around navigating and consuming Confluence content
 
### Baseline KPI values
- VFS sentiment around current platform documentation: [MURAL board](https://app.mural.co/t/adhocvetsgov9623/m/adhocvetsgov9623/1587506427611/4fb63eb007eadec05ce8634499699ff610706a7d)

## Assumptions

* Building out Confluence will lead to greater self-service and fewer support requests.
* Confluence will be easier for VFS teams to navigate and surface the resources they are looking for.
* Any given Platform Team will be able to customize Confluence without undue burden.
 
## Solution approach

2020 Q2: _HMW enable Platform Teams to be responsible for populating and maintaining the Platform Website?  HMW guide Platform Teams to deprecate information on GitHub?_

2021 Q1: Created landing pages

2020 Q4: Piloted using Confluence to increase findability of Platform Website info, using backend developer information.  _HMW leverage Confluence to improve the info findability for VFS teams?_

  * [VFS-facing website](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/)
  * [Conf instance](https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/pilot/overview)
* We identified how VFS developers prioritize and group tasks in order to develop an easily navigable IA.
* With the pilot, we established a process of uncovering and understanding VFS developers' task/categorization association.
