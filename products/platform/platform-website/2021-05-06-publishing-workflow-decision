## Context

The Content Team is writing roles and responsiblity and publishing workflow guidance.  Here are the options we see regarding ____.

## Paths forward

### Option 1 

#### Option 1a (recommendation): Immediately include Platform PMs in the publishing workflow

Add PMs to the `scroll-viewport-admins` Confluence user group.  This allows the Platform team to:

- we'd have to do additional trainings with the PMs 



- Pros: as soon as teams have their guidelines, they can be self-sufficient in creating and publishing their docs
- Cons: Our IA and guidelines are still incomplete/rough around the edges. Letting a bunch of publishers in ASAP might be a little chaotic


#### Option 1b: Include PMs in the publishing workflow _later_ (perhaps mid/end of Q3)

- Pros: Gives us a chance to surface initial concerns/issues with structure or publishing guidelines before letting more people loose in the admin console
- Cons: teams have to wait to be fully self-service for

### Option 2: Never have PMs be part of the publishing workflow

- Pros: Not many… Content team would have visibility into changes being made and could flag quality/editorial concerns 
- Cons: Teams can’t self-serve to publish. We could be a bottleneck. We’d have to work out a regular content “deployment” schedule and support it (e.g., someone from our team publishes daily at 3PM)


## Decision

To come.
