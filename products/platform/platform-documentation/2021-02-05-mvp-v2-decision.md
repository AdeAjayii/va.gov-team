# What would "MVP V2" of the Platform Documentation look like at end of 2021 Q1?

This doc provides context to make a decison around the scope of Platform Documentation MVP 2.  Although this doc mostly concerns The "Migrate" Initiative, the decision will impacts on our "Plan" Initiative, since the two relate to the same Platform Documentation product.

## Context

In 2020 Q4, the Content/IA team piloted an MVP of the Platform Documentation product.  The MVP focused on backend developer documentation. In 2021 Q1, the Content/IA team wants to build "MVP V2."

This decision primarily impacts the scope of the Migrate Initiative.  However, the scope of the Migrate Initiative does have resource implications on the Plan Initiative.

The goals of all of the following options are to (a) create a comprehensive and trustworthy entry point to Platform Documentation, aka Platform Docs MVP2.  This allows us to (b) retire The Home Page MVP.


## Paths forward

### Option 1 (recommended by the Content/IA team): Follow persona-based IA, with exit page tracking to GH instead of content transformation

Migrate and apply tracking on the viable links from The Home Page MVP, and follow the personas from the customer segmentation research.  

This allows us to:

- **Understand what people are clicking on:** We hypothesize that knowing the info our audience is seeking will allow us to have a better idea of what content to transform.
- **More thoroughly develop our Plan Initiative:** We hypothesize that going light on the migration will allow us _more time_ to iterate on a Q2-and-beyond plan with VSP PMs.

### Option 2: Follow practice area-based IA, migrate all viable content, and transform a subset of documents

Migrate home- and top-level pages from The Home Page MVP.

- **All viable content from The Home Page MVP will be reflected on the Platform Docs MVP2 landing page:** We will be bound by the same practice-based IA, that does not follow the customer segmentation research.
- **We would not be able to thoroughly develop our Plan Initiative:** The Content/IA team does not have the subject matter expertise in isolation - we would have to rely heavily upon other VSP teams to dedicate time to working with us on content transformation.  Time spent on collaborating with other teams' ICs means time _not_ spent on developing our Q2-and-beyond plan.

## Decision

To come.
