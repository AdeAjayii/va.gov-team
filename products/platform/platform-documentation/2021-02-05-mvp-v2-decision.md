## Platform Documentation artifacts

- [Backend development documentaton (Platform Documentation in Confluence)](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/)
- The "Plan" Initiative: [Documentation Site — Create Confluence migration plan for VFS-facing docs #17375](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/17375)

## Context

In 2020 Q4, the Content/IA team piloted an MVP of the Platform Documentation product.  The MVP focused on backend developer documentation. In 2021 Q1, the Content/IA team wants to build "MVP V2". 

## Paths forward

Note: This decision primarily impacts the scope of the Migrate Initiative.  However, the scope of the Migrate Initiative does have resource implications on the Plan Initiative.

### Option 1 (recommended by the Content/IA team): asdf



### Option 2: asdf

### Option 3: asdf

going all-in on developer docs (which requires at least some developer involvement regardless of whether it’s me or someone better qualified to work on developer docs)
going all-in on the rest of the platform docs
Some combination of the above, (which I think is what leadership seemed most interested in and is probably where your 2nd bullet is coming from.)

## Decision

To come.
