## Platform Documentation artifacts
- [Product outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/platform-documentation/product-outline.md)
- [Backend development documentaton (Platform Documentation in Confluence)](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/)
- 2020 Q1 Scroll Viewport research <- needs link

## Context

In 2020 Q4, the Content/IA team piloted the documentation tool Confluence for backend developer documentation.  We tested a plugin called Scroll Viewport to customize the look and feel of the site.  Now that Scroll Viewport's free trial period is over, we have to evaluate if we want to continue as a paid customer.

## Paths forward

### Option 1 (recommended by the Content/IA team): Continue using Scroll Viewport

Continue to use Scroll Viewport as a paid customer.  This allows us to:

- **Customize the look and feel of our Platform Documentation:** We are able
- **Have greater control over the publishing workflow:** 

### Option 2: Cease using Scroll Viewport

Cease to use Scroll Viewport, instead using "vanilla Confluence" with no other look/feel customization plugin.

## Decision

To come.
