# Feature Request Prioritization Product Outline [Draft]

## Overview

A process for the Platform to receive feature requests in a standard way, prioritize them using the Value Matrix, add approved ones to teams's initiative backlogs, and then communicate back to customers and stakeholders.

## Problem Statement

Currently, there is not a streamlined process for the Platform to receive and prioritize feature requests. As a result, we could be missing out on valuable iterations we didn't think of and it is very difficult to communicate to customers or stakeholders around the priority of their requests.

## Personas

VFS teams, Platform Crew teams, OCTO-DE leads, Platform Leadership.

## Desired User Outcomes 
- **VFS Teams:** VFS teams have a standard way to submit feature requests to the Platform and be notified of their status.
- **Platform Crew Teams and Leadership:** 
  - Can find all submitted feature requests in a single place.
  - Receive feature requests with sufficient information to be quickly assessed and prioritized
- **OCTO-DE:**
  - Can view all submitted feature requests and their status in a single place.
  
## Desired Business Outcomes 
- Platform Crew teams prioritize feature requests against other initiatives on their roadmap and backlog.
- Customers and other stakeholders can easily find the status of submitted feature requests.
- The Platform delivers enhancements that increase customer satisfaction.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- % of feature requests scored using the Value Matrix each month

#### Baseline KPI Values

- TBD

------

## Assumptions
- By not having a standard, transparent process for prioritizing feature requests, the Platform is:
  - Missing out on valuable initiatives we didn't think of - most risky.
  - Not communicating effectively to customers the priority of feature requests.

## v1 Solution Approach 
- Based on requirements generated with Leadership, we're solving for the following in the first iteration:
  - All requests must be submitted in the same way
  - Provide transparency to OCTO-DE and requestors
  - Define what information must be included in a feature request submission
  - Teams use the value matrix 
  - Platform PMs/TLs/POs meet to go over new requests, determine ownership, and score them using the value matrix
  - Notify submitter their request has been reviewed
  - Feature requests are listed in a customer-facing view
