# Feature Request Prioritization Process

## Overview

A process for the Platform to receive feature requests in a standard way, prioritize them using the Value Matrix, add approved ones to teams's initiative backlogs, and then communicate back to customers and stakeholders.

## Problem Statement

Currently, there is not a streamlined process for feature requests to get on the value matrix, be scored and moved to team's backlogs. We could be missing out on valuable iterations we didn't think of and it is very difficult to communicate to customers or stakeholders around the priority of their requests.

## Personas

VFS teams, Platform Crew teams, OCTO-DE leads, Platform Leadership.

## Desired User Outcomes 
- **VFS Teams:** VFS teams have a standard way to submit feature requests to the Platform and be notified of their status.
- **Platform Crew Teams and Leadership:** 
  - Can find all submitted feature requests in a single place.
  - Receive requests with sufficient information to be quickly assessed and prioritized
- **OCTO-DE:**
  - Can view all submitted feature requests and their status in a single place.
  
## Desired Business Outcomes 
- Platform Crew teams prioritize feature requests against other initiatives on their roadmap and backlog.
- Customers and other stakeholders can easily find the status of submitted feature requests.
- The Platform delivers enhancements that increase customer satisfaction.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- *% of submittted feature requests that are reviewed by Platform team PMs/TLs/POs each month*

#### Baseline KPI Values

- *Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible.*

------

## Assumptions

- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

*Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:*

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

*For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built.*
