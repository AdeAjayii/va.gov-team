# Feature Request Prioritization Process

## Overview

*A brief description of the product.*

## Problem Statement

Currently, there is no streamlined process for ideas to get on the value matrix, be scored and moved to team's backlogs. We could be missing out on valuable iterations we didn't think of and it is very difficult to communicate to customers or stakeholders around the priority of their requests.

## Personas

 VFS teams, OCTO-DE leads, Platform Leadership, Platform teams.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- % of submittted feature requests that are reviewed each month

#### Baseline KPI Values

- *Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible.*

------

## Assumptions

- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

*Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:*

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

*For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built.*
