# Research Plan for Customer Support Slack Workflow

Service Design

March 2021


## Goals	



1. What product [tool/service/document/process] & Platform team are you doing this research for? This research is in support of Platform’s Customer Support. 

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? Link to the product outline.

    
The customer support Slack workflow serves a couple of purposes  

1) create a single destination for VFS teams to go for questions and requests of Platform  
2) make requests/questions for Platform folks that are on-call more clear  
3) allow for reporting of customer support requests

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 

*   What are some things that VFS team members reach out for help from Platform support?
*   If prompted, can VFS team members find the customer support shortcut in Slack? 
*   Does the workflow form that VFS team members complete match their expectations of getting help?
*   What is their expectation of what will happen after completing the form?
*   Does the workflow form make it easier for Platform to respond to requests? 
*   Is there any information we can provide to make the Platform response more efficient? 

 
4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?


    -  We hypothesize that option 1 (topics) will align with the majority of use cases and result in faster help for Platform support staff.


    - The length of _I need help with_ dropdown will be difficult to scan and make the appropriate selection for VFS team members. 

 	


## Method	


1. What method of research are you planning? 	

    We will be conducting directed interviews and usability testing with high-fidelity prototypes. They will be moderated remotely.


    2. Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	


    We have 2 solutions we want to test to see which aligns with the type of help VFS team members might need and makes Platform support more efficient.  A short interview will allow us to gather types of inquiries people might have when seeking support. Then, conducting a short usability testing will allow us to test the task of getting help from the Platform with some of the scenarios mentioned in the interview. Each participant will see both option 1 and option 2. Followed by a debrief session. We will alternate between which options participants see first. 


    3. Where are you planning to do your research? 


    Research will be conducted remotely via Zoom and recorded. 


    4. What will you be testing? 	


    We will be testing 2 sample forms built-in Slack to help inform the choice between the 2 options.  



## Participants and Recruitment	



1. Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	
(Mention: Number of participants, practice areas, VFS team, VFS product. Please keep in mind that we have a limited number of VFS teams, and we should avoid going to the same people and teams back-to-back.)

*   10 - 12 VFS participants
    *   4 BE Engineers
    *   4 FE Engineers
    *   2 PMs
    *   2 Designers
*   7 VSP support staff
    *   4 Utility Dev (Engineers)
    *   1 Analytics
    *   1 Content Support
    *   1 IA Support
    
2. What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(Usually, it is a Slack message directly to the team or team members. Contact the Design Lead if you need help getting in touch with anyone.)	 \
We’ll reach out in Slack directly to participants. Will consider [past participation with studies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V8Nswcbcp-SzQBTBUZNCnCCcs9WwbJ2CrAEbdFSNmMI/edit#gid=775867416).


## When? 	

1. Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(Schedule your research at least 1 week in advance if possible to give your participants time to organize their calendars) 

    The research will be conducted between April 5 - 16. 

2. Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	

    March  28th 

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling) e.g. 30 minutes, &lt; 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours) 

    30 minutes 

4. Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Keep in mind that VFS team members are also remote and live in different time zones. Try and keep research sessions during normal working hours.	

5. Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	


## Team Roles	

Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need help finding someone to take notes for you, contact the Design Lead** 	

Moderator:	

*   Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator): Naomi Marcussen, Jonathan Nelson 
*   Participant recruiting & screening: Jonathan  (VFS) & Naomi (VSP) Calendly?
*   Project point of contact: Jonathan 
*   Participant(s) for pilot test: TBD
*   Note-takers: Naomi and Rebekah
*   Observers: James Chasia, Michael Manalo, Rebekah Hickey, Naomi

**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
