# How VSP does user research

## DEPO Platform Users

The audience for the DEPO platform is _not_ Veterans. We are designing for:
- VFS teams (product managers, engineers, designers, content writers, QA specialists, accessibility specialists, researchers)
- Dependent/Platform-adjacent teams (CMS, Lighthouse)
- DEPO product owners

Because we support and collaborate with them daily, it can be easy to forget that they are our users. 

There are a few exceptions to this group of users (Identity team, Contact Center team, some of the Product Support team's work). Reach out to the design leads if you need a hand figuring out who exactly your audience is.

We should be conducting **generative user research** with all of these groups as part of discovery to help guide our product decisions, and **evaluative usability** testing to make sure the things weâ€™re making are working.
