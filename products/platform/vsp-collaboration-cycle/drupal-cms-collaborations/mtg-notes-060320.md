## Meeting Details
- Attendees: Megan, Andrea, Kevin W, Oksana
- Date: 6/3/20
- Topic: Initial CMS <> Collab Cycle conversations 

## Agenda 
- What are known questions?
  - When a VFS team is starting an initiative using existing Drupal components, where does CMS team need to come in to the development cycle (if at all)? (Example — Public Websites team migrating & redirecting legacy content)
  - When a VFS team is interested in “doing a new thing” in Drupal CMS, where do we identify that (and hand VFS team off for “CMS Discovery”)? (Example — Thoughtworks Chatbot team considering using CMS to support their work or BAM2 Debt Letters MVP)
  - When a VFS team is editing/updating existing Drupal components (ex. fixing global accessibility issues), who takes point on collaborating with VSP? (Example — Facilities team working on templated global navigation) 
- Are there any known pain points not addressed in the above questions? 
- What are our prioritized next steps/open questions, and who needs to be involved?

## Notes 

Meeting Notes — 

Kevin: when Collab Cycle was kicking off, embedded developer strategy was being developed 
Public Websites team is quite a bit different than a lot of other teams 
Chatbot discovery request 
BAM2 product discovery request 

Tier 2 content that doesn’t belong in a benefit hub - is that a Public Websites domain? Chatbot is another example, it’s meant to mirror the FAQ page which is owned by the Public Websites team. There’s a parallel between those product teams. 

BAM2 debt letters may be hybrid project. Up to now, CMS has only supported unauthenticated content. 

CMS can’t prioritize things right now — slammed by supporting product teams already. If we could loop this in with Pub Websites it might be easier, but overall CMS is slammed. 

Can the potential for CMS discovery happen BEFORE the collab cycle project kickoff? That really should land on DEPO (maybe we talk to Danielle about whether she can help identify these things earlier?) 

Megan — what are other big pain points that the CMS team is feeling? 

Oksana — prioritization of this work. We don’t have enough bandwidth to prioritize these things. 

Other discovery requests — 
Learning Centers (Public Websites)
Campaign Landing Pages (Public Websites)

## Next Steps 

- CMS Team <> VSP continue discussions
