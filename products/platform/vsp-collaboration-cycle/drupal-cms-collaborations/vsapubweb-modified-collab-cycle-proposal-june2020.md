# [WIP Proposal for] Modified Collab Cycle for Drupal-Only Initiatives 

_Public Websites Life Insurance content migration as beta_

## Stage: Define
- Project Kickoff
- Content Intent Collaboration

## Stage: Discover
- IA Request
- OPTIONAL Check Ins - All Practice Areas
- Analytics Request (as needed)

## Stage: Build
- Pre-Launch Final Review - Content & IA ONLY
- Contact Center Review (as needed)

## Stage: Validate
- Post-Launch Design, Accessibility, QA, IA Reviews

In order to allow the team to move forward without pre-launch accessibility reviews, there are some VSP requirements for accessibility best practices and reviews that Public Websites will have to be doing on their own.

Defining those is WIP, but may look something like ... 

- Content writers must have access to and adhere to a "accessibility best practices for content writers" guide (Danielle and Peggy are drafting this)
- Content writers must be checking the automated accessibility errors that appear in Drupal when viewing content in a preview using the node id (Megan to check in with Public Websites team and/or the CMS team about whether folks are seeing those currently and changing their content as a result)
- Content writers must be doing some level of manual accessibility checks on their own before publish (checklist to come)
