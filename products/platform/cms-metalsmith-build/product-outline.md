# VA.gov CMS Build Pipeline - Product Outline

## Overview
The VA.gov CMS exports data from Drupal in a format that must be converted to static HTML, which can be served to VA.gov. The metalsmith build pipeline fits into the CMS ecosystem as described in this diagram:

## Problem Statement
*In a couple of sentences, describe the Who, What, Why, and Where of the challenge / pain point you seek to address.*

## Personas
* VA.gov CMS content editors (indirectly)
* VFS teams who work are product owners of content models (ex. VSA Facilities team)

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* Content build time 
* Number of nodes that the VA.gov CMS & build pipeline can support _(or alt measurement of amount of content/number of pages)_
* Number of VFS initiatives that are blocked by the VA.gov CMS & build pipeline

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
