# Cypress Testing — Product Brief

### What is it?

Cypress is a functional testing tool that is used to test the complete frontend flow of a product (this is typically referred to as e2e testing). [Maybe another sentence about what it is?]

### How does it work?

Cypress replaces the VA.gov Platform's previous use of Nightwatch. Frontend developers building products on VA.gov write Cypress tests [where? or other info?]. Unlike Nightwatch, Cypress allows developers to [do this cool thing]. Additionally, there is a form tester that automates Cypress end-to-end (E2E) tests on VA.gov form applications.

### Version Notes

Beginning 8/1/20, VSP is requiring that all teams building on VA.gov use Cypress for newly written functional tests. We are encouraging — but not requiring — teams to migrate legacy tests from Nightwatch into Cypress.
