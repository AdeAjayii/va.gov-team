<h1>Background </h1>
All previous research associated with the current Review Page pattern was reviewed. We learnt that multiple research studies had been conducted with developers and designers to better understand their experience building forms using the current Forms Library. However, there has been no research with Veterans regarding their experience using the current Review Page. As a result, it was decided that one project goal is to plan and execute research with Veterans on their experience working with the current Review Page and two proposed variations. Based on Veteran feedback, one Review page variation will be chosen to implement as part of the Q2 Working Demo. The team has chosen the Application for Burial Benefits form (21P-530) to research with Veterans.
<h1>Research Goals</h1>
The Forms Library Team aims to understand:

How Veterans use the Review Page in the form experience and more specifically the Application for Burial Benefits form Review Page
Identify pain points and accessibility issues on the Review Page of the Application for Burial Benefits form experience
How Veterans interact with the Review Page components in order to determine which of the two design variation best suit their needs 
<h2>Outcome</h2>
The findings from this research will help the team better understand Veteran needs and expectations around the Review Page (after completion but before submission of a form). Based on use, Veteran expectation and preference, a Review Page pattern that best suits Veteran needs will be chosen to build in the Q2 Working Demo. 
</h1>Research Questions </h1>
<h3>General VA form filling experience</h3>
What VA forms have you filled out in the past?
Typically, who fills out the forms? (You or does someone else help you fill the forms?)
What device do you use to fill out the forms? On your phone, computer, etc.?
Typically, how long does it take for you to fill a form?

<h3>Review Page</h3>
When in the process do you usually verify the information before submitting the form?
Please talk to me about your experience editing or correcting any entry on the Review Page? 
<h3> Design Options </h3>
Compare the three design options to identify which better suits your need
Open versus closed accordion
Editing in Review page versus the original page
Edit button per section or one for each element
Using ‘edit’ versus ‘change’ (terminology)

<h3>Pain Points</h3>
Thinking about the Review Page specifically, what are some of the things you like and don’t like about using the Review Page?
Can you talk to me about some other forms you have filled out in the past and how easy or hard it was for your to complete the form(s)
<h1>Method</h1>
60 mins 1:1 semi-structured interview with 6 Veterans and 1 pilot session with a team member

To talk about their experiences filling out forms (10mins)
Share the burial form prototype and fill out a couple of pages to get them grounded (10mins)
Talk about Review Page in general (do they review before submission, do they edit before submission) (10mins)
Share the three variations of the Review page and compare the three design options to identify which better suits your need
Open versus closed accordion
Editing in Review page versus the original page
Edit button per section or one for each element
Using ‘edit’ versus ‘change’ (terminology)
Task - request the participant to edit a typo in a specific form field to observe how participants find/edit information
