# Research Plan for VSP, Medallia, 2021

## Goals

This study is being conducted by the VSP Contact Center team. The study follows the user feedback tool called Medallia, which is a Veteran Experience Office product within the VSignals suite. 

Veterans and their families need a trustworthy way to provide feedback for the digital services that the VA offers. 

### Usability Study Goals:

- Document any potential concerns with moving the Medallia feedback to the bottom of the main content section of a page

### Research Questions:

- Are users able to locate the feedback form easily, on all devices?
- Are veterans able to navigate through the form easily?
- Do veterans understand the questions and answers that are asked of them?
- Do veterans understand how to answer each question?

### Hypothesis

- Veterans will be able to find the proposed button design quicker and easier than the standard Medallia button design.

## Method

We will conduct remote moderated usability testing and directed interviews via Zoom using the Perigean contract. These methods will help us:

- Gather quantitative data on usability of the survey through the usability testing and some of the directed interview questions
  - Discern whether or not the form is easy to locate. This will be measured through calculating button findability success rate and time to find.

We will be utilizing the digitial prototyping program Figma to perform the usaibility tests over Zoom.

## Participants and Recruitment

We are seeking to perform this test with 12 participants

**Must have for participants**

- Users who have visited VA.gov previously
- We are seeking to perform this usability test with 5 mobile participants. Therefore, five participants who answer *yes* to:
  - Do you prefer to use your mobile device when visiting VA.gov?
  - *Note: if this is too strict of a qualifier, we can ask "Have you visited VA.gov on your mobile device previously?"*

**Good to have for participants**

- Users that have a DSLogon Premium, MHV Premium, or ID.me login

In order to ensure we are testing with a representative population of veterans, we are aiming to include participants that match the following demographics:
