# How to request a Medallia survey (WORK IN PROGRESS)

**Summary:** this document outlines Medallia surveys and how you can request one for your Veteran-facing service.

## How to request a survey

Fill out the [survey implementation request template] (template & link to be added). 

The issue will be triaged to the VSP Analytics & Insights team and will be implemented in Staging based on the URLs provided. Once approved by the VFS product manager or product owner in staging, the survey will be pushed to Production and the issue will be closed after another approval.

Please allow 1-2 sprints for the survey to be implemented, depending on the complexity.

## Surveys

There are two recommended surveys for Veteran-facing Services: [forms survey] (questions/answers link to be added) and [content survey] (questions/answers link to be added). 

How these surveys are structured:

Forms:
- [Include where the feedback link will be on the page]
- [Include any user behavior interception that can be implemented - this will be a future release and will increase complexity for adding the survey]

Content:
- [Include where the feedback link will be on the page]
- [Include any user behavior interception that can be implemented - this will be a future release and will increase complexity for adding the survey]

We recommend the above survey templates to create consistency across va.gov services. If you are looking to further customize your survey, please reach out to VSP Analytics & Insights on the DSVA Slack channel, #vfs-platform-support, and begin your message with `VA.gov survey inquiry`.
