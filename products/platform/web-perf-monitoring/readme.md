# Web Performance Monitoring v0.1
Provide standards and monitoring to help measure, evaluate, and govern website performance. 

## Performance Standards
In order to track and monitor performance VSP has researched and documented a list of success metrics along with recommended thresholds that teams should not exceed. Through our monitoring software (Speedcurve) performance budgets for the metrics/thresholds will be established for all VFS teams.

List of [Performance Metrics and Thresholds](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/frontend/speedcurve/performance-standards.md#metrics)

## Performance Monitoring  
By leveraging the software application, [SpeedCurve](https://www.speedcurve.com), VSF teams can easily track, test and optimize UI performance for their application.

[Why did we choose Speedcurve?](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/platform/web-perf-monitoring/web-perf-monitoring-product-outline.md)

### Track Performance
- Teams will have access to a performance budget dashboard which tracks their performance each week against [VSP standard performacne metrics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/engineering/frontend/speedcurve/performance-standards.md#metrics)

### Test Performance
- Speedcurve allows teams to easily test the performacne impact of new code through their "Changes" and "Benchmarking" capabilities. 

### Optimize Performance
- Speedcurve provides an emmense amount of detail to help teams quickly identify the root of performance issues.
  - Slowest and Largest Requests
  - 3rd party blocking Requests and Long Tasks
  - Hero Rendering Times
  - Rendering Times
  - Page Load Times
  - Time to interactive
- Speedcurve includes the full suite of Lighthouse Audit scores and recommended optimizations
