# Research Plan for Comparison Tool Enhancements, Comparison Tool (Digital GI Bill) Team, September 2022

This research request comes from the Digital GI Bill team for the Veterans Benefits Administration Education Service. Digital GI Bill looks to modernize the GI Bill experience in order to improve the user experience, improve claims processing, address the complexities of recent legislation, and integrate the legacy IT systems. This research plan comes from the Human Centered Design (HCD) agile team as we look to conduct usability testing for a feature within VA education, The Comparison Tool. Usability testing will inform us how students can learn about and compare their GI Bill benefits at approved schools, employers and VET TEC providers. 

## Background
The Digital GI Bill team looks to update features of the GI Bill Comparison Tool, an unauthenticated feature on Va.gov, to enable students to make better decisions about their GI Bill benefits. The current state of the GI Bill Comparison Tool has unintuitive features that may make navigating the tool a suboptimal experience. The GI Bill Comparison tool is used by all potential education beneficiaries, including Veterans, service members, and their family members. How might we improve the GI Bill Comparison Tool so that it is built for every journey?

### OCTO Objectives 
* Veterans and their families can find a single, authoritative source of information
* Veterans and their families trust the security accuracy and relevancy of VA.gov
* Platform users can build and deploy high-quality products for Veterans

### Veteran Journey
* Aquiring the appropriate education, new skills, and credentials
* Finding the right job
* Taking care of my family

### Outcome
1. Understand what designs across the Comparison Tool work best for the user and reduce burden/cognitive load, while also being cognizant of accessibility concerns
2. Understand what content is most important to a user when deciding on their best suited school
3. Utilize these findings to iterate on current designs and let user research drive the rest of the design process


### Research questions
1. Before seeing designs, what are the user preferences for information within the Comparison tool?
2. What does the user prefer/prioritize when presented with alternative design options? What additional comments do they have?
3. What is most important content on institution cards for the user?


### Hypothesis
For students who have used education benefits in the past, we anticipate that the enhanced comparison tool features will be clearer and more intuitive for them. Updated formatting and icons will all enhance the user experience. When comparing to the current-state Comparison Tool, users might be may feel more confident choosing the right school for their unique education journey. We also believe future design iterations will be necessary to meet the diverse needs of all users.  

## Method	
**1. What method of research are you planning?**	
- The team will be collecting user feedback for the comparison tool feature via a cohort-based research survey. All research will be conducted in a remote, unmoderated setting. Participants will receive a custom survey link and instructions via Microsoft Form.  

**2. Methodology**
- All participants will receive the survey link with instructions to complete the form. The survey will remain open until Friday September 9th at 5 pm est.  

**3. Why this method? How dos this methodology help you answer your research questions?**
- Research surveys are a flexible research tool to gather information about the comparison tool users, their attitudes, and their behaviors. By using a research survey method, we can track both quantitative and qualitative data to help inform future design iterations. This survey will use a combination of both open-ended responses, multiple choice questions, and rankings to gather information about user’s preferences.  

**4. Location**
- This will be remote, unmoderated research.

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
Please submit artifacts for [Research Review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Research-review.1781891143.html) 8-9 days prior to the first planned research day for remote studies so Perigean can begin recruiting one week prior. Perigean requires 2+ weeks for in-person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? Ideally it's ready a week before testing begins and has also been through a [Midpoint review](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/Midpoint-review.1781039167.html).

A pilot session is required. Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
* Planned dates of research:

### Length of sessions
* Session length: (e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours)
* Buffer time between sessions: (30 minutes recommended to reset between sessions, debrief with team, if a participant arrives late, or a session goes slightly over time) 
* Maximum Sessions per day: (We all have limits - how many sessions can you and your team conduct in one day considering the session length, the mental strain of conducting sessions, other work you still need to complete in a day, etc?)

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in **EASTERN Standard Time**. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 

Please request enough dates and at ***least double the amount of time slots for the number of requested participants***. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.; ***12 time slots for 6 participants***). This helps Perigean book participants when there are more time slots available, and when sessions need to be rescheduled or filled in with further recruitment.
	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker**
