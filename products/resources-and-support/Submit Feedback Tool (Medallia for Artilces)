# Submit Feedback Tool (Medallia for Articels) Product Outline Template


---

## Overview
*The Search and Discovery team would like to move away from having a separate feedback tool and use Medalia. Medalia will offer a conbmined experience for the Veterans
as well streamline operations internally. Additionally Medalia already has analytics capabilities that the S&D team can build off of.*

## Problem Statement
*Currently the Research and Article pages have the option for a veteran to submit whether their experienc on the page was good or bad. The S&D team have been
discussing adding additional canned messages for selection so we can futher analyze the reason for the selection i.e why it was good or bad. 
VA.gov also has a feedback survey selection on the right hand of the application. When we look to adding quetions for artcile experience it makes sense to
explore combining our efforts with Jason Woodman's team and utilize Medalia.*

*Follow your problem description up with a "How might we... _______" statement re-framing that challenge as an opportunity. Don't hint too much at what the solution might be, you should have enough of a focal point here to guide your ideas, but plenty of freedom to think laterally and innovatively as you experiment and prototype later.*
