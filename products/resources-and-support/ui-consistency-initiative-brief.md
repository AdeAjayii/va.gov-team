# UI Consistency Initiative Brief Template
#### Overview

<details>
 
 *The current R&S Article pages to not match the style of the rest of the VA.gov pages. They do not match because the design patterns were not documented on the <a href="https://design.va.gov/">VA.gov Design System</a>. We've created proposed UI updates for R&S Article pages to align with the rest of VA.gov. 'Related information', 'VA Benefits', 'Need more help?' section styling should align with the rest of VA.gov.* We also want to ensure that these changes are reviewed and approved by our Design, UI and Accessibility experts so that they inherently adhere to standards when implemented.

 <Summary>Examples:</Summary>
 
 - *Product: VA.gov- R&S Article Page: https://www.va.gov/resources/can-i-be-buried-in-arlington-national-cemetery/* 
   - *Initiatives: The above page outlines the issues related to the page and specifically these areas: 'Related information', 'VA Benefits', 'Need more help?'.*


 
---

## Outcome Summary
> *Completing this project will align the style of the R&S Articles with the other pages/articles on VA.gov*
* Approximately 70 articles on R&S will be updated with this effort*
* Going forward this will be the standard style utilized for any new R&S articles*

## Problem
> *R&S Article page do not match the design system for va.gov.:* 
* The problem is the discrepancies in the style and visuals for the pages. We have gone through and determined every R&S article page needs updated. 
* This issue is a result of design patterns not being documented on the Design System. 
* Correcting these pages creates a more seamless experience for the Veterans. Inconsistent UI on pages can create confusion and can create distrust.

<!--
## Desired User Outcomes
- *With this problem solved, users will see the same design patterns on R&S as they see across VA.gov*
- A consistent UI is a better experience for Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates as it allows them to form one mental model that carries across each tool that follows the same design pattern.
- Consistent calls to actions (links, buttons, downloads) enable users to quickly recognize these elements as they are encountered on different tools, providing a more accessible experience for those with cognitive disabilities.
- Users utilize links more frequently because they are easier to recognize on each affected page.
- Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates are more quickly and easily able to access the content, forms, documents, facilities, or other resources they need.

## Undesired User Outcomes
## Desired Business Outcomes

- Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates use the search tools more.
- Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates take advantage of the resources they are searching for.
- Veterans, their caregivers, and their advocates are less likely to call for support.
- VSP teams spend less time identifying and documenting accessibility and/or usability issues like those listed below because search elements are designed and written in a manner that includes affordances.
- VSA teams spend less time remediating accessibility and/or usability issues because compliance comes "baked in" when Engineers implement an approved component from the library

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
> ðŸ’¡ *All article pages on Va.gov have been updated.*
> ðŸ’¡ *All newly created artciles on VA.gov use the new template going forward.*

- Product KPI | Baseline | Target | Link to data source (e.g. GA, Domo) N/A

## Discovery
### Assumptions/Risks
> *Identify risks related to usability, value to users, feasibility/implementation, and viability given organizational constraints<sup>2</sup>. 
> Indicate how you'll validate/test against these risks.*

- **Value Risks** (will people use it): 
  - .
- **Usability Risks** (can people figure out how to use it):
  - .
- **[Technical] Feasibility Risks** (can we build it with available tech/data):
  - Examples:
    - API availability
    - Site performance impacts (see [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/), #-daily-lighthouse-scan)
  
- **Organizational Viability Risks/Constraints** (will there be a positive organizational impact):
  - Examples: VA stakeholder testing, marketing, compliance requirements 

### Prioritization
> *Describe how the team will consider competing solution hypotheses/ideas. Prioritize them accounting for reach, impact/value, effort, and confidence.*

### Solution Summary
> *Within this intiative the goal is to correct formatting, font, style , and links including regular and major links on all R&S atricle pages. Below I have attached two examples. The first example is the basic template and the second example is includes information from and existing R&S article in the basic template.

Updated sections styles:

**Related information:** 
Using the style, "Related Links, for navigating to related information outside a content section". 
While most links are within Resources and Support, there are times where from outside R&S are used. There could be an argument to use the "Major Links" section if links were restricted to only R&S links.

Used elsewhere: [Pay your VA copay bill](https://www.va.gov/health-care/pay-copay-bill/), [Coronavirus FAQs](https://www.va.gov/coronavirus-veteran-frequently-asked-questions/)

**VA benefits:** 
Using the style, "Quick Links, for navigating to related topics located outside of a section". Link descriptions are not used within this style. 

Used elsewhere (similar to 'Need help?' style): [Apply for burial benefits](https://www.va.gov/burials-and-memorials/application/530/introduction)

**Need help?:** 
Using the style, "Quick Links, for navigating to related topics located outside of a section". Update header from "Need more help?" to "Need help?"

Used elsewhere: [Apply for burial benefits](https://www.va.gov/burials-and-memorials/application/530/introduction)
