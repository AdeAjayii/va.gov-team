## Problem
> *R&S Article page do not match the design system for va.gov.:* 
* The problem is the discrepancies in the style and visuals for the pages. We have gone through and determined every R&S article page needs updated. 
* This issue is a result of previously used typefaces that were not the approved typefaces. 
* Correcting these pages creates a more seamless experience for the Veterans. When any individual sees a visual appearence change on a site they may think they have been taken to a different site which can be frustrating and confusing.
