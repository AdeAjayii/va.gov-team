## Outcome Summary
> *The current R&S Articles (UI) are not inline with the rest of va.gov. This project will allow us to update design and create a more seamless universal experience for the Veteran*
* .

**Related/Associated product(s)**
- Product | Link to product outline- N/A

## Problem
> *R&S Article page do not match the design system for va.gov.:* 
* The problem is the discrepancies in the style and visuals for the pages. We have gone through and determined every R&S article page needs updated. 
* Why do you think the problem is occurring? Other reasons why this might be occurring?
* Correcting these pages creates a more seamless experience for the Veterans. When any individual sees a visual appearence change on a site they may think they have been taken to a different site which can be frustrating and confusing.
