# Submit Feedback Tool (Medalia for Articels) Product Outline Template


---

## Overview
*The Search and Discovery team would like to move away from having a separate feedback tool and use Medalia. Medalia will offer a conbmined experience for the Veterans
as well streamline operations internally. Additionally Medalia already has analytics capabilities that the S&D team can build off of.*

## Problem Statement
*Currently the Research and Article pages have the option for a veteran to submit whether their experience on the page was good or bad. The S&D team have been
discussing adding additional canned messages for selection so we can futher analyze the reason for the selection i.e why it was good or bad. 
VA.gov also has a feedback survey selection on the right hand of the application. When we look to adding quetions for artcile experience we have a couple options to explore. All options require working with Jason Woodman's team to maket the appropriate decisicion for the path forward.*

*Some of the options that exist could include combining the survey experiences, displaying them individually on the correct pages/articles, working towards if this then that decision trees, etc...*
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- *Veterans may be confused why they are asked different questions on different pages on the website note- research to validate*
- *Solving the issue of multiple surveys could provide less frustration, more efficiency, ability to submit issues, and just an overall improved 
- experience for the Veterans*

## Undesired User Outcomes
- *Creating a frustrating experience for the Veterans*
- *Creating a more time consuming experience for the Veterans*


## Desired Business Outcomes

- *Streamlined sensible process for Veterans to submit feedback*
- *Utiliziation of Medalia since it is already implemented and provides analytics*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- *Additional similar processes in different groups*
- *Additional reporting tool creations*
