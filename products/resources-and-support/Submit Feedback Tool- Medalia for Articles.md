# Submit Feedback Tool (Medalia for Articles) Product Outline


---

## Overview
*The Search and Discovery team would like to move away from having a separate feedback tool and use Medalia. Medalia will offer a combined experience for the Veterans as well streamline operations internally. Additionally Medalia already has analytics capabilities that the S&D team can build off of. Medallia's Feedback Survey Tool that we are interested in utilizing will allow users to rate multiple article pages on R&S*

## Problem Statement
*Currently the Research and Article pages have the option for a veteran to submit whether their experience on the page was good or bad. The S&D team have been
discussing adding additional canned messages for selection so we can futher analyze the reason for the selection i.e why it was good or bad. 
VA.gov also has a feedback survey selection on the right hand of the application. When we look to adding quetions for artcile experience we have a couple options to explore. All options require working with Jason Woodman's team to maket the appropriate decisicion for the path forward.*

*Some of the options that exist could include combining the survey experiences, displaying them individually on the correct pages/articles, working towards if this then that decision trees, etc...*
 
## Desired User Outcomes

- *Veterans may be confused why they are asked different questions on different pages on the website note- research to validate*
- *Solving the issue of multiple surveys could provide less frustration, more efficiency, ability to submit issues, and just an overall improved experience for the Veterans*

## Undesired User Outcomes
- *Creating a frustrating experience for the Veterans*
- *Creating a more time consuming experience for the Veterans*
- Inconsistent UI for submitting feedback
- Users feel interrupted and/or frustrated by attempts to collect feedback

## Desired Business Outcomes
- *Streamlined sensible process for Veterans to submit feedback*
- Product/content owners are able to quickly and easily access user feedback
- Product/content owners are able to understand user feedback in order to make improvements
- *Utiliziation of Medalia since it is already implemented and provides analytics*
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*

## Undesired Business Outcomes
- *Additional similar processes in different groups*
- *Additional reporting tool creations*
- *User feedback is hard to access and/or understand*
- *The type of feedback collected is not helpful to the product/content owner*

## Measuring Success
- *Utilization of the solution implemented will determine the success of using Medalia vs. the existing good/bad feedback tool. 

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
*Data that will be collected are:
 *1. # of responses
 *2. # of good vs bad responses
 *3. highest and lowest selected additional reasons for the experiencem (we will disucss what these answers should be with the content team)*
     *- xxx
     *- xxx
     *- xxx
* _The most important metrics to collect are the responses from the Veterans_
* _Nicole to check with Jason to ensure we can use the same dashboard they have in MVP and build off of it._
* _**Limit 5-6 KPIs per product**__

| Category | Ease of use | Service completion | Trust/Satisfaction | Health |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------|
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |
| KPI      |             |                    |                    |        |

#### Baseline KPI Values
* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics. These may come from other systems other than VA.gov e.g. eBenefits._

## Assumptions
- *Medalia can be enabled/disabled on certain pages*
- *S&D could have a separate set of questions or add questions to Medalia and have those presented on the appropriate article pages*
- Medallia's Intercept Tool allows users to submit feedback only once and will not reappear until 90 days later. We will not be utilizing this tool

## Solution Approach

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

### Initiatives
*Include initiatives (iterations, new features, etc.) to improve this product. See the [Initiative Brief Template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/product/initiative-brief-template.md)*

## Solution Narrative
*What will users see after they click the blue feedback button near the footer? Currently a modal appears when a user clicks the blue button on the right side of the page, is anything changing after a user clicks the blue button? A modal with the three standard Feedback survey questions we currently serve; nothing in that regard is changing right now.
*Can you share more details on the release/testing plan? And can R&S article pages be a part of testing?Yes, we do plan to test functionality on staging for each template and also run general 508 accessibility tests. This can be included in this. We need to make sure that Jason confirmed this*
*Is this userflow possible with Medallia? If a user rates the page poorly a list of issues (such as "Typo") with checkboxes will appear to allow users to report problems with the pagex. I do believe this is possible, though will likely require a fair amount of customization (i.e. engineering) on our side. This type of scenario would also likely need to go through our experimental design process. This is supported but will be implemented towards Q1.
