# eFolders Migration MVP


## Overview
*eFolders allows Veterans to view artifacts that are pertinent to their interactions with the VA, by migrating to va.gov we will provide the veterans a better experience, ease of use in locating pertinent artifacts. *

## Problem Statement
Currently eFolders lives on eBenefits, it requires multiple authentication points, and is difficult to use. Further, eBenefits is being subsetted in favor of having va.gov be a single point of interaction and single authentication for the Veteran. 

 
## Desired User Outcomes

 - SSO on va.gov to see all contents in eFolders
 - Easy to understand navigation for all artifacts in a Veteran's eFolder
 - No more than 3 clicks to view desired document .

## Undesired User Outcomes


## Desired Business Outcomes

 - Provide an experience that makes it easy for a Veteran to find document or artifact that they are searching for. 
 - Seamless experience on va.gov including SSO. 

## Undesired Business Outcomes

 - Having to log into more then one system 
 - Unclear navigation which makes it hard to understand where the document the Veteran needs can be found.

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

 - Total Number of documents viewed/downloaded- This is an indicator that the Veterans found what they were looking for. 
 - Decrease in calls pertaining to acquiring documents into call center. (Pending current baseline) 
 - Less then 3 clicks to find document the Veteran is looking for 

#### Baseline KPI Values
* Pending 

### Objectives and Key results (OKRs)
_What are the measurable targets you're aiming for that delivers value for Veterans?_

- Objective:   Easy to use document repository that allows to Veteran to find what they are looking for 
  - Key result: Under 3 clicks to find document the Veteran is looking for 
  - Decrease of calls to contact center because the veteran is not able to locate a  document that is available online 


---

## Assumptions
- At this point (kick-off) we are making the assumption that all the documents and artifacts are stored on VBMS and use the API methods documented. 
- Vets API can be utilized for authentication or all document retrieval 

## Solution Approach

**MVP**
There is a requirement to migrate eFolders from eBenefits to va.gov as eBenefits is in the process of being sun-setted. The MVP is to migrate the existing functionality to va.gov without any loss of features and functionality. Additionally, MVP iteration will utilize SSO so the veterans have a seamless experience on va.gov 

**Potential Future Iterations**
Will be evaluated once the MVP is released and usability is conducted.

## Go-to-market Strategy
- This is migration from eFolders to va.gov. We will redirect traffic to va.gov and Veterans can navigate using va.gov menus.

## Solution Narrative
