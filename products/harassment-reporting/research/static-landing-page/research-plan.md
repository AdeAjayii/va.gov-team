# Research Plan: Harassment Reporting Tool--Static Landing Page
 	
## Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on the new poster and static landing page about harassment reporting at the VA. From these resources, we would like Veterans to know how to report harassment at the VA.

## Background
If a Veteran experiences harassment or other inappropriate behavior while at a VA Site, they can report it by calling a phone number at the VA. A recent Congressional act _(H.R.2452 - Deborah Sampson Act)_ mandated providing harassment information online, which will be available from the VA.gov website. We would like to get user feedback on a new static information page before it launches. _[IS THIS DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE CONGRESSIONAL ACT IS MANDATING ACCURATE?]_

## Research questions *(need to prioritize which to ask in this study)*
1. What do Veterans do today to report harassment at the VA? *(e.g., talk with someone/police at the VA, call 911, google)*
2. How would Veterans find out how to report harassment at the VA? *(e.g., ask someone, google it, VA.gov)* 
3. Where do Veterans look to find information on harassment on VA.gov? *(DO WE WANT TO KNOW THIS?)*
4. What are users' reactions to the static landing page? 
    1. What do they do to report harassment? Where do they click? *(i.e., scroll down on page vs. call the urgent phone number in the top alert box)*
    3. Reactions to information in the light blue box?
    4. Any comments about the how-to information being too far down on the page? 
    5. Reactions to all the different VA locations and phone numbers?
    5. What do they expect to do next?
5. How do Veterans prefer to report harassment? (ask at end) *(e.g., in person at the VA, via phone, via online form on phone/tablet/computer)*
6. How do Veterans feel about the process of reporting harassment to the VA? *(HARD TO ASSESS without the experience of filing a report...maybe save these for when we can test the online reporting form)*
    1. Do they feel safe?
    2. Do they feel like they are treated with compassion?
    3. Do they feel heard?
    4. Do they trust that the VA will believe them and do something about it? 
    5. Do they understand what will happen next?

## Hypotheses
1. Veterans want to report harassment that occurs at the VA.
2. Veterans will learn from the poster how to report harassment that happens at the VA.
2. Veterans will learn from the static landing page how to report harassment that happens at the VA.
5. _OTHERS? WHAT ARE OUR SUCCESS CRITERIA?_

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants will be shown a mobile design prototype in UXPin that shows TBD *[POSTER, VA.GOV, STATIC LANDING PAGE?]* Participants will be asked to use their smartphones to access the prototype.

*[ATION ITEM: Need to get the most recent poster and static landing page put into a new prototype in UXPin. Also need to remove QR code from poster because we won't be linking to online reporting form, and add a phone number. Accordions and phone numbers on the static landing page should be clickable.]*

Potential user tasks:
- While you were at the VA for a doctor's appointment, you saw a poster about harassment, but you're no longer there. How would you find this poster now? *(google it? VA.gov?)*

## Participants and Recruitment	
Because harassment is a potentially triggering subject, we want to be careful about recruiting people to participate in this research. We would prefer to get Veterans who have experienced harassment at the VA and are able to participate in research sessions without re-triggering the trauma that have experienced. Our plans include the following:
- Provide an overview of the session for Perigean personnel to read to potential participants and then ask if they are comfortable participating.
- Work with VA contacts to find social workers or clinicians to observe the sessions with the Veterans and provide support if trauma-triggering occurs. 
- Limit the number of observers in the session to **one** team member (plus the moderator, a social worker, and a Perigean notetaker for a total of 4 people in the Zoom room with the participant).

### Participants to recruit

Ask Perigean to recruit **10** Veterans in order to get **5** completed sessions using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants
- ALL are Veterans
- ALL are comfortable talking about harassment at the VA and sharing their opinions about it
- ALL have a smartphone and are willing to join our Zoom call from their phone
  - All have a working microphone on their phone
  - All have the Zoom app downloaded to their phone prior to the session and know how to share their screen
  - During the session, all are willing to share their web browser window over Zoom

*PERIGEAN: In your reminder calls/emails, could you please mention that they need to **join from their smartphone**, not a computer or tablet?*

### Good to have for participants
- At least 4 people have experienced harassment while applying for, using, or communicating about VA benefits
- At least 4 women
- At least 2 men
- At least 3 people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender
- At least 2 people of color
- At least 1 participant 55 or older
- At least 1 participant 35 or under
- At least 2 people with a cognitive disability (e.g., TBI)
- At least 2 people who don't have any degree or vocational training after high school (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least 1 person that has a college degree (to include officer Veterans)
- At least 2 people who live in a rural or remote area
- At least 1 person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least 1 non-native English speaker


### Additional questions to ask in the screener
- VA is working to stop harassment and make our locations and services safer for all. As part of these efforts, we are exploring online resources to make it easier for Veterans to report harassment at VA. Feedback from Veterans like you will help us make sure that these resources meet your needs and are easy to use. Are you interested in trying out harassment resources and sharing your opinions about them? *(If they answer "no", don't recruit them. If "yes", ask the next question...)*
  - We’re contacting you because you’re a Veteran, not because we believe that you have been harassed. Have you ever experienced any kind of harassment while applying for, using, or communicating about your VA benefits? This can include harassment that happens at a VA location, during a phone or video call, or in written communications. Harassment might be catcalling, negative comments about your gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation, or unwanted attention or gestures. *(If they answer "no", OK to recruit them. If "yes", ask the next question...)*
  - If you participate in this feedback session, you might get reminded of your own experiences with harassment. Would you feel comfortable participating? *(If they answer "no", don't recruit them. If "yes", OK to recruit them and record "harassed at VA" in Participant Roster and Schedule)*
- What device will you use to join the research session? *(Must be a smartphone and NOT iPad/tablet, computer, or laptop)*
- What is the first language that you learned to speak as a child? *(If not English, record as "non-native English speaker")*
- It is important to us that the services and applications we design meet the needs of all Veterans. We ask the following question to ensure that we conduct feedback sessions with representative populations. Do you identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender? Yes, No, or Decline to Answer? *(Please record  response in Participant Roster and Schedule)*
