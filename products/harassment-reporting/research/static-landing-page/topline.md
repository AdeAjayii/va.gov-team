This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on the new static landing page and poster about harassment reporting at VA. From these resources, we would like Veterans to know how to report harassment at VA.

## Participants
We talked to **14 Veterans** and showed some of them the poster (only those who were on desktop and not using a screen reader) and all of them the static landing page. 

## Preliminary Findings
### Issues with the landing page and poster
1. Some Veterans read the content closely and appreciated all the details, while others thought it was way too much and just wanted the phone number to report harassment. The landing page and poster need to serve both audiences by providing the most important information up front and optional access to more details (progressive disclosure).
2. Many participants were concerned about the limited hours for the harassment reporting phone number because the time of day when they finally summon enough courage to report harassment is unpredictable. They don't want to have to wait until the next morning or weekday. Also, the limited hours make it inconvenient for Veterans with a day job to report in private after work. Some said they might call the Veterans Crisis Line but doubted that they would  be able to report harassment that way.
3. Some participants expected a link on the landing page to report online and were disappointed when they couldn't find one.

### Broader VA Issues
1. More than half of the Veterans said that they would report to the patient advocate at the facility. Many expected that if the patient advocate wasn't the right person, they would get you to the right person. Do patient advocates currently do this? Veterans shared about the frustrations they've had in trying to get issues at VA resolved and how they're often passed off from person to person, especially over the phone. We need the process of reporting harassment to be less of a burden so people will actually do it.
3. Many Veterans are skeptical about these new words from the VA about taking harassment reporting seriously because of their many experiences to the contrary at VA and in the military. They don't think anything will change at VA, but several said that they are hopeful. They need to see evidence of systemic change beyond the content in a poster or web page.
4. Some Veterans shared their own stories of harassment at VA, and especially disturbing are those where the perpetrator is a VA employee. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed by the VA, and one that revising the HRT landing page and poster isn't going to fix.
