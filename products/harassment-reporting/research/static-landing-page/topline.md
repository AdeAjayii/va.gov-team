This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on the new static landing page and poster about harassment reporting at VA. From these resources, we would like Veterans to know how to report harassment at VA.

## Participants
We talked to **14 Veterans** and showed some of them the poster (only those who were on desktop and not using a screen reader) and all of them the static landing page. 

## Preliminary Findings
### Issues with the landing page and poster
1. **Desired amount of content varies greatly among participants.** Some Veterans read the content closely and appreciated all the details and the organization, others skimmed through the headings and didn't read much else, and others said that it was way too much information and just wanted the phone number to report harassment. The landing page and poster need to serve this entire range of audiences by providing the most important information up front and optional access to more details (progressive disclosure). 
1. **Patient advocate was preferred way to report.** More than half of the Veterans said that they would report harassment to the patient advocate at the facility. Many expected that if the patient advocate wasn't the right person, they would get you to the right person. (Do patient advocates currently do this?) Veterans shared about the frustrations they've had in trying to get issues at VA resolved and how they're often passed off from person to person, especially over the phone. We need the process of reporting harassment to be less of a burden so people will actually do it.
2. **Much harassment isn't reported for a variety of reasons.** Many participants said they wouldn't report harassment in the hypothetical situation discussed during the session (on your way into a medical appointment, someone said something rude and made a sexual gesture that made you feel uncomfortable) because it happens so often, didn't seem bad enough to report (not too offensive or physical), and wouldn't do any good if you don't know the name of the person. They'd just say something directly to the person and then try to forget about it. 
3. **Hours for reporting by phone were too limited.** Some participants were concerned about the limited hours for the harassment reporting phone number because the time of day when they finally summon enough courage to report harassment is unpredictable. They don't want to have to wait until the next morning or weekday. Also, the limited hours make it inconvenient for Veterans with a day job to report in private after work. Some said they might call the Veterans Crisis Line because it's available 24x7 but doubted that they would be able to report harassment that way.
4. **Expected to be able to report online.** Several participants expected a link on the landing page to report online and were disappointed when they couldn't find one.
5. **Poster looked familiar.** Some participants reported seeing a poster with similar messages in VA facilities. (I obtained a copy from one of the social worker observers, which I will include in the full research report.)

### Broader VA Issues
7. **Resources met with varying degrees of skepticism.** Some Veterans appreciated these efforts by VA on harassment reporting, while others said they're skeptical because of their many experiences to the contrary at VA and in the military. They don't think anything will change at VA and want to see evidence of systemic change beyond a new poster or web page.
1. **Some harassment perpetrated by VA employees.** Some Veterans shared their own stories of harassment at VA, and especially disturbing are those where the perpetrator is a VA employee. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed by the VA, and one that revising the landing page and poster isn't going to fix.
