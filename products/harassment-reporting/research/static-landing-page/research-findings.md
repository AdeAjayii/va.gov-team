# Research Goals

The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on the new static landing page and poster about harassment reporting at VA. From these resources, we would like Veterans to know how to report harassment at VA.

# Research Questions
1. How do Veterans today report harassment at VA? 
2. How would Veterans find out how to report harassment at VA? 
4. What are users' reactions to the poster?
    1. What sentiments/feelings do they express? 
    2. How would they report harassment? 
4. What are users' reactions to the static landing page? 
    1. What sentiments/feelings do they express? 
    2. Feedback on content, organization, and/or length of page?  
    1. How would they report harassment? 
    6. What do they expect will happen after they report?
    
5. How do Veterans prefer to report harassment? (ask at end) 

# Methodology 
We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on **March 14-18, 2022** with **14 Veterans**. Each session started with questions about how participants would report a hypothetical harassment incident and where they would look for information about reporting harassment at VA. 

Then, *if the participant was using a computer and NOT a screen reader*, they were shown the poster (the PDF was screen-shared by the moderator, and the participant was given mouse control so they could scroll).

ALL participants were given the URL for the landing page on the Staging server and asked to interact with it on their device while sharing their screen.

After reviewing the landing page (and maybe the poster), research participants were asked whether they had any experiences with harassment at VA. 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions
1.  
    1. MOSTLY TRUE: 
1. 
    1. MAYBE TRUE: 
3. 
    1. PARTLY TRUE: 
1. Veterans will feel comfortable reporting harassment that occurs at VA.
2. Veterans will learn from the poster how to report harassment that happens at VA.
2. Veterans will learn from the static landing page how to report harassment that happens at VA.
3. Veterans will understand what will happen when they report harassment at VA.

# Details of Findings 

## Feedback on the landing page
All 14 participants provided feedback on the landing page.
1. **Desired amount of content varies greatly among participants.** 

    2. More than half of the participants (8 of 14) said that the landing page had a lot of information and was straightforward and helpful. Three participants read the content closely, opening all the accordions, and appreciated all the details and the organization. One participant asked if it's going to be launched soon because they want the information on how to report harassment at VA.
    4. Five participants skimmed through the headings but not the details below. One said that they would read more details if they wanted to report harassment.
    5. 2 participants said that it was way too much information and they wouldn't take the time to look at it all. 
    
    > *"Likes that it gives a lot of information...ample amount of resources...communicates that this is something important to VA" (p4).*
    
    > *"Struggle to find the info needed amidst so much writing...I don't want to read a bunch of stuff...just want to find the link to call or fill out online" (p13).*
7. Three participants were **skeptical that the wording in the landing page reflects new change and policies at VA**. One participant thought that the landing page showed that VA is being more transparent about harassment than it has been in the past, but they were skeptical that anything was actually different.
> *"A bit more transparent than VA has been in the past...Honestly, it feels like 'nice try'. This is cool, but we've kind of seen this stuff before. I've been getting this since I was in the service--classes about sexual harassment, and nothing changes" (p9).*

> *"Is this creating a product to cover their behind? I wonder about the resources offered...wait to assess until try it" (p4).*

> *"Can be written like this, but...does it actually happen that way?...I think it sounds great, but in reality, we can only hope that it's going to be followed" (p15).*

 

1. **Page layout gives the impression of a shorter page.** Two people--one using a screen reader and one not--stopped scrolling the page after the subway map steps because they interpreted the separating line just below that as indicating the bottom of the page.

3. **Hours for reporting by phone were too limited.** Some participants were concerned about the limited hours for the harassment reporting phone number because the time of day when they finally summon enough courage to report harassment is unpredictable. They don't want to have to wait until the next morning or weekday. Also, the limited hours make it inconvenient for Veterans with a day job to report in private after work. Some said they might call the Veterans Crisis Line because it's available 24x7 but doubted that they would be able to report harassment that way.
4. **Expected to be able to report online.** Several participants expected a link on the landing page to report online and were disappointed when they couldn't find one. (So we should definitely get back to working on this!)

## Feedback on the poster
11 of 14 participants provided feedback on the poster; 3 participants didn't because they were using a smartphone or a screen reader.
1. **The poster looked familiar.** Some participants reported seeing a poster with similar messages in VA facilities. (I obtained a copy from one of the social worker observers, which I will include in the full research report.)

## Attitudes around harassment and reporting
1. **Patient advocate was a popular way to report.** More than half of the Veterans said that they would report harassment to the patient advocate at the facility. Many expected that if the patient advocate wasn't the right person, they would get you to the right person. (Do patient advocates currently do this?) Veterans shared about the frustrations they've had in trying to get issues at VA resolved and how they're often passed off from person to person, especially over the phone. We need the process of reporting harassment to be less of a burden so people will actually do it.
2. **Much harassment isn't reported for a variety of reasons.** Many participants said they wouldn't report harassment in the hypothetical situation discussed during the session (on your way into a medical appointment, someone said something rude and made a sexual gesture that made you feel uncomfortable) because it happens so often, didn't seem bad enough to report (not too offensive or physical), and wouldn't do any good if you don't know the name of the person. They'd just say something directly to the person and then try to forget about it. 

## Broader VA context
7. **Resources met with varying degrees of skepticism.** Some Veterans appreciated these efforts by VA on harassment reporting, while others said they're skeptical because of their many experiences to the contrary at VA and in the military. They don't think anything will change at VA and want to see evidence of systemic change in addition to a new poster and web page.
4. **Some harassment perpetrated by VA employees.** Some Veterans shared their own stories of harassment at VA, and especially disturbing are those where the perpetrator is a VA employee. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed by the VA, and one that revising the landing page and poster isn't going to fix.



# Recommendations

1. The landing page and poster need to **better serve the entire range of audiences who want to read the details *vs.* only the headers *vs.* just the phone number/link to report** by providing the most critical details up front with optional access to more information lower down and/or accessible via links (progressive disclosure). Is the purpose of this page to explain how to report harassment, or is it a hub for all information about harassment? If it's focused on how to report harassment, some specific suggestions are below:

    2. Put the phone number/link to report at the very top, and maybe also what you do when you report and what VA will do.
