# Research Goals

The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on the new static landing page and poster about harassment reporting at VA. From these resources, we would like Veterans to know how to report harassment at VA.

# Research Questions
1. How do Veterans today report harassment at VA? 
2. How would Veterans find out how to report harassment at VA? 
4. What are users' reactions to the poster?
    1. What sentiments/feelings do they express? 
    2. How would they report harassment? 
4. What are users' reactions to the static landing page? 
    1. What sentiments/feelings do they express? 
    2. Feedback on content, organization, and/or length of page?  
    1. How would they report harassment? 
    6. What do they expect will happen after they report?
    
5. How do Veterans prefer to report harassment? (ask at end) 

# Methodology 
We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on **March 14-18, 2022** with **14 Veterans**. Each session started with questions about how participants would report a hypothetical harassment incident and where they would look for information about reporting harassment at VA. 

Then, *if the participant was using a computer and NOT a screen reader*, they were shown the poster (the PDF was screen-shared by the moderator, and the participant was given mouse control so they could scroll).

ALL participants were given the URL for the landing page on the Staging server and asked to interact with it on their device while sharing their screen.

After reviewing the landing page (and maybe the poster), research participants were asked whether they had any experiences with harassment at VA. 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions
1.  
    1. MOSTLY TRUE: 
1. 
    1. MAYBE TRUE: 
3. 
    1. PARTLY TRUE: 
1. Veterans will feel comfortable reporting harassment that occurs at VA.
2. Veterans will learn from the poster how to report harassment that happens at VA.
2. Veterans will learn from the static landing page how to report harassment that happens at VA.
3. Veterans will understand what will happen when they report harassment at VA.

# Details of Findings 

## Feedback on the landing page
All 14 participants provided feedback on the landing page.
1. **Desired amount of content varies greatly among participants.** 

    2. More than half of the participants (8 of 14) said that the landing page had a lot of information and was straightforward and helpful. Three participants read the content closely, opening all the accordions, and appreciated all the details and the organization. One participant asked if it's going to be launched soon because they want the information on how to report harassment at VA.
    4. Five participants skimmed through the headings but not the top paragraph or the details below. One said that they would read more details if they wanted to report harassment.
    5. 2 participants said that it was way too much information and they wouldn't take the time to look at it all. 
    6. One participant said they didn't know what will happen after they report; they must not have read the "What to expect after you file your report" section.
    
    > *"Likes that it gives a lot of information...ample amount of resources...communicates that this is something important to VA" (p4).*
    
    > *"Struggle to find the info needed amidst so much writing...I don't want to read a bunch of stuff...just want to find the link to call or fill out online" (p13).*
7. Three participants were **skeptical that the wording in the landing page reflects new change and policies at VA**. One participant thought that the landing page showed that VA is being more transparent about harassment than it has been in the past, but they were skeptical that anything was actually different. 

> *"A bit more transparent than VA has been in the past...Honestly, it feels like 'nice try'. This is cool, but we've kind of seen this stuff before. I've been getting this since I was in the service--classes about sexual harassment, and nothing changes" (p9).*

> *"Is this creating a product to cover their behind? I wonder about the resources offered...wait to assess until try it" (p4).*

> *"Can be written like this, but...does it actually happen that way?...I think it sounds great, but in reality, we can only hope that it's going to be followed" (p15).*
  - Veterans aren't necessarily going to pay attention to a new web page about harassment since there's been a long-standing culture around sexual harassment in the military and at VA. A new web page is only one part of a larger communication plan needed across all of VA and individual facilities. And it needs to speak to ALL Veterans, including women who have been repeatedly harassed at VA.
 

1. **Page layout gives the impression of a shorter page.** Two people--one using a screen reader and one not--stopped scrolling the page after the subway map steps because they interpreted the separating line just below that as indicating the bottom of the page.

3. **Hours for reporting by phone were too limited.** Half of the participants (7 of 14) were concerned about the limited hours for the harassment reporting phone number because the time of day when they finally summon enough courage to report harassment is unpredictable. They don't want to have to wait until the next morning or weekday. Also, the limited hours make it inconvenient for Veterans who work during the day to report in private after work. Some said they might call the Veterans Crisis Line because it's available 24x7 but doubted that they would be able to report harassment that way. One person wondered what message they would get if they tried calling the phone number to report after hours.

> *"I would hope for a 24-hour line...Sometimes this stuff happens at 3 am, or you remember it at 3 am, or you come to the conclusion that you should report it then...I experience delayed reaction when I have issues like that" (p12).*

> *"Hurry up and do it in the heat of the moment before you decide not to...VA complicates things" (p13).*

> *"Would discourage me from making a call" because it might be closed by the time I get home from my appointment" (p11).*

5. **Expected to be able to report online.** Four participants expected a link on the landing page to report online and were disappointed when they couldn't find one. They wanted to be able to write out what happened in private instead of having to talk to someone, and also not get stuck on hold on the phone. One participant said that they would text VCL if they didn't want to talk to someone.
> *"Sometimes you're on hold forever...I don't want to call the VA again...also if you're not comfortable talking about it" (p8).*

7. **What participants *liked* about the landing page:**
The following is a list of what participants mentioned liking about the landing page, with the number of participants who said this in parentheses if more than one:
    1. Definition of harassment and examples, including verbal comments so you know when you should report it (3 participants)
    1. Alert box at top with phone numbers (3)
    1. Organization with jump links at top and dropdowns for more information (3)
    1. List of questions at the bottom (2)
    1. Hyperlinks for phone numbers to call or text because they stand out visually and easy to use from a phone (2)
    1. Important that a visitor can report harassment--not just Veterans (2)
    6. The opening paragraph
    > *"First paragraph is very sympathetic...It makes you feel as through the VA is taking harassment very seriously" (p15).*
    7. Red VCL button
    1. "What to expect when you file your report" section
    1. Subway steps in "What to expect after you file your report" 
    1. "How to report harassment" section
    1. "Information we’ll ask you to share" section
    1. Good that you can report in any of these locations (in the "Report harassment in person" section)
    
7. **What participants *didn't like* about the landing page:**

    8. The opening paragraph 
    9. Don't need the definition of harassment
    10. Important information is too hidden--about if you're not comfortable giving your name (you have to click on it to read it) 
    11. Confusing to see the 800 reporting number with hours and the 24x7 VCL number. VCL is for suicide reports and won't be able to help me with harassment reporting.
    12. "How to quickly get the help you need" is smaller font than the text above it
    13. The header "Report harassment as a Veteran or visitor to VA" doesn't attract my attention
    14. Some language is too strong and overpromises:
      - "Stop the harassment" (under subway step 2 in "What to expect after you file your report") erodes trust when harassment happens again. Better to say that we can't stop it but can curtail it.
      - "Corrective action happens right away". Better to say "corrective action will be taken" (don't say that it will happen right away).
    17. Some langauge has too condescending of a tone:
    - "Harassment is any unwanted behavior that creates a hostile space"--Better to be supportive without being condescending: "Harassment can happen to anyone, and it's not your fault".
    - "Read this page to learn how..." Better: "Below you will find how to report harassment and what to expect..."
    1. "Corrective action" sounds like it refers only to VA employees. 	
> *"This seems to be directed towards employees of the VA because it says that they will take the appropriate action. I am not sure how they can make someone come back to receive punishment if they are not an employee and walk out the door" (p12).*
  
9. **What participants thought was *missing* on the landing page and should be added:**

    12. Examples that are and aren't considered harassment so know what to report and what not to report (2 participants)
    11. More information on sexual harassment and how it's different from harassment and assault
    12. Reassurance that it's OK to submit a report if you don't know the person's name--add this near "name or a description of the person".
    > Could say that the report is "Still taken seriously. Please still report even if you don't have the name of the person. Any description you can give would be beneficial" (p11).
    14. That you can discuss harassment with your primary care provider or therapist because you're comfortable with them and trust them
    15. Offer a chaplain as a resource (suggested by a military chaplain who has been helpful in helping deal with shame)
   
11. **Questions about content on the landing page:**

    8. What if the person doing the harassing is a visitor to VA instead of an employee? Is that covered here? Not finding it in the questions at the end.
    9. Can you report in-person at a different location from where the harassment occurred? Or must it be the one where the harassment occurred?
    10. If I'm a man, can I request that I report with a woman? Or is that option only for women?
    11. Why is discrimination at very end of the page separate? It should be integrated into the "What harassment is" section.
    12. What is meant by "VA police"? Is it the onsite security guards?
    13. Who will be taking harassment reports and how will they be trained? *"Who are the people taking harassment reports? Veterans? Contractors? VA employees? Medical professionals? Someone with expertise? Someone who could reassure me that some action would be taken and in what timeframe?" (p5).*

    3. Re "What harassment is and when to report it": Thought it would be tell me when to submit a report--do it now or wait until I get home? Do I have a limited amount of time?
    4. How do you contact VA police? Is there a phone number to call, or do you flag them down? If so, where are they? Every location would have a different phone number and location.
    5. Why would you go to a cemetery to file a report?
    6. Re "Get phone numbers for VA national cemetery district offices": *"Do many people get harassed in cemeteries?" (p12).* A different participant mentioned that some people get harassed by Veteran funerals.
    7. How will I be contacted after the inquiry is complete? Email? Phone?

## Feedback on the poster
11 of 14 participants provided feedback on the poster; 3 participants didn't because they were using a smartphone or a screen reader.
1. **Mixed feedback overall**. 

- 7 participants thought all the information needed to report harassment. One said that they want to see more of these at VA, especially in bathroom stalls.
- 4 people thought it was too wordy. 
- 2 people thought it wasn't new information. 
- 2 people said they'd take a picture with their phone so they could read it later. One of them said they wouldn't take the time to read it in a high-traffic area because they might be judged by others.
> *"Thorough, a lot of information. Would take a picture with my phone" (p7).*
> 
> *"Not going to read all that!" (p6).*
> 
> *"Good lord, too busy! Imagine looking at in an elevator--not enough time to read the whole thing" (p8).*
> 
> *"Just one more announcement--not that different from what I've seen" (p9).*

3. **The poster looked familiar.** One participant reported seeing a poster with similar messages in a VA facility. (I obtained a copy from one of the social worker observers, which is included in the appendix. This poster has many fewer words so easy to scan, and also a QR code for more information.) Another participant said they've seen sexual harassment messages like this in every bathroom and doorway while in the military.

5. **What participants *liked* about the poster:**
    1. Very clear with phone number to call
    > *"That's new. Don't have much hope, but would try it" (p9).*
    1. "What harassment is and when to report it" section
    2. Suggestion of a security guard because you might want someone in uniform to help
    3. Information that's in bold and larger font because you look at it right away

7. **What participants *didn't like* about the poster:**
    1. Not helpful to explain what harassment is because it seems condescending (2 participants)
    2. What you should what you should do (e.g., number to call) doesn't stand out. You need a simple message immediately if you're upset, traumatized, upset, and/or mad.
    3. Confusing to see 911 or VA police at the top because didn't see at first that it's for sexual assault or immediate harm.
   
9. **What participants thought was *missing* on the poster and should be added:**
    1. A QR code to get more information
    1. That you can discuss harassment with your primary care provider or therapist because you're comfortable with them and trust them
    

11. **Questions about content on the landing page:**
    1. Who can I report? A VA employee or Veteran/visitor/patient?
    1. What is "the VA police"? The security guards onsite?
    1. How do you contact the VA police? Is there a phone #? Do you just flag them down? If so, where are they? Every location would have a different phone number and location. One participant said they they know that you can find security at the front desk, and VA police roam around but have an office in back.

## Attitudes around harassment and reporting
1. When asked how they would report harassment, participants said they'd decide based on their current location (i.e., report in person if they're at a VA site vs. report by phone if they're at home), their own preferences, and their past experiences. Many said they'd try one method, and if it wasn't helpful, they would try a different way. 

> *"Did you take my account seriously? If not, I will try the next resource...Don't want a single point of failure" (p4).*

  - **In-person with a patient pdvocate was the most popular way to report.** 9 of 14 participants said that they would report harassment to the patient advocate at the facility. It is unclear whether this is because of the content in the landing page and poster, the current VA anti-harassment poster in some facilities, and/or past experiences.  Participants expected that if the patient advocate wasn't the right person, they would get you to the right person (e.g., the VA police). (Do patient advocates currently do this?) Veterans shared about the frustrations they've had in trying to get issues at VA resolved and how they're often passed off from person to person, especially over the phone. We need the process of reporting harassment to be less of a burden so people will actually do it. Some participants said that they wouldn't report harassment to a VA-contracted medical provider or building security staff because of bad experiences they've had with them.
> *"Best place...to get someone with authority. They get you to the right person...Have used patient advocates before in person and over the phone with mixed results" (p13).

  - Participants had different reasons for wanting to report in person:
    1. So the person you're talking to can see the anger/frustration in your face (2 participants)
    2. So you have a person's name who you can go back to if you have more information
    3. So it's more likely that the person bothering you is still there
    4. If you need help right then (e.g., someone is following you or yelling at you), go directly to the security desk or find VA police
    5. I can talk better over the phone because I can focus
    6. I can trust my primary care provider or therapist
 
 - SUMMARIZE "PREFS FOR HOW TO REPORT" DATA IN SEP. SPREADSHEET TAB to see proportion of in person vs. phone vs. other--mk a table
    - before showing resources
    - after seeing poster
    - after seeing landing page
    - going forward
    
    One participant said they would call Women's Veterans Call Center b/c more comfortable, safe talking with a woman about this

3. **Much harassment isn't reported for a variety of reasons.** Many participants said they wouldn't report harassment in the hypothetical situation discussed during the session (on your way into a medical appointment, someone said something rude and made a sexual gesture that made you feel uncomfortable) because it happens so often, didn't seem bad enough to report (not too offensive or physical), and wouldn't do any good if you don't know the name of the person. They'd just say something directly to the person and then try to forget about it. 

## Broader VA context
7. **Resources met with varying degrees of skepticism.** Some Veterans appreciated these efforts by VA to acknowledge that harassment exists and finally trying to do something about it, while others said they're skeptical because of their many experiences to the contrary at VA and in the military. They don't think anything will change at VA and want to see evidence of systemic change in addition to a new poster and web page.
> *“For years, no one wanted to admit this type of behavior was going on” (p6).*

> *"I used to have some hope that it would be different, but no longer. With the VA, I don't expect anything because you'll only be disappointed" (p9).* 


9. **Some harassment perpetrated by VA employees.** Some Veterans shared their own stories of harassment at VA, and especially disturbing are those where the perpetrator is a VA employee. This is a serious issue that needs to be addressed by the VA, and one that revising the landing page and poster isn't going to fix.



# Recommendations

1. The landing page and poster need to **better serve the entire range of audiences who want to read the details *vs.* only the headers *vs.* just the phone number/link to report** by providing the most critical details up front with optional access to more information lower down and/or accessible via links (progressive disclosure). Assuming that the purpose of this page is to explain how to report harassment (and not a hub for all information about harassment), some specific content suggestions are below:

    1. Have an eye-catching short title that's a call to action (e.g., from the current VA anti-harassment poster: "If you are harassed or sexually assaulted" in big bold letters).
    2. Just below the title, have the phone number/person/link to report (landing page and poster) and links to what you do when you report and what VA will do (landing page only) or a QR code for more information (poster only).
    4. (landing page only) Add details on what is/not harassment, especially verbal comments, along with messaging about if you feel uncomfortable, there's no need to satisfy specific rules or definitions of harassment. Ideally hide such details under links/accordions to avoid triggering.
    5. (poster only) Minimize the number of words so it's easy to scan and understand in a short amount of time. Consider deleting the "What harassment is and when to report it" section at the bottom.

1. Reconsider the audience of these harassment reporting materials:
    1. Victims of harassment and witnesses of harassment--Highlight the importance of reporting harassment that you winess because that can help reduce the burden to report on the victims of harassment.
    2. All genders including women and non-binary folks--With the current gender-neutral language, some women may feel unseen as targets of harassment. Consider acknowledging women specifically by using the word "women" in some places in the materials.


1. **Simplify the harassment reporting process to reduce the burden on the person reporting** because they may be distraught and not know whether what happened is assault, sexual assault, or harassment. Give them simple options for reporting so they don't have to try multiple options when they're upset. For example, provide only one phone number for reporting by phone so they don't have to figure out whether to call 911 or somewhere else. The people who receive these calls or in-person reports need trauma-informed training in what to do and how to support people who are reporting harassment. This includes VA providers and VA-contracted providers, who also might receive harassment reports.

1. To report harassment by phone, there needs to be one phone number that you can call ANYTIME day or night. We need to focus on the user experience of the person gathering up the courage to report. The current phone number with limited hours and days will lead to fewer harassment reports and also likely erodes trust in VA. If there are some hours/days that the phone number isn't answered, there needs to be a message on it that tells callers how to report harassment in another way.

1. Provide an online form to report harassment because that's more comfortable for some people.

3. The new web page and poster on harassment reporting is only one part of a larger communication plan needed across all of VA and individual facilities that needs to speak to ALL Veterans, including women who have been repeatedly harassed at VA, about what systemic changes are happening. One research participant suggested handing out a little card that has the the harassment reporting phone numbers, just like is currently done with VCL.

### Screenshot of the web page reached from the QR code in the above poster 
The QR code in the poster above leads to the following web page for the VHA Assault and Harassment Prevention Office. It contains information including a spedometer-type gauge of behavior that goes from Acceptable to Sexual Violence/Assault, which doesn't seem helpful and might actually be harmful.
