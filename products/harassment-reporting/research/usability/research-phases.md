# Research Phases: Harassment Reporting Tool
 	
## Overview	
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on the new online harassment reporting tool. Because harassment is a potential trauma trigger, we want to be careful about recruiting Veterans to participate in this research. To address this ethical concern, we propose to start by talking with **subject-matter experts (SMEs) who work with Veterans dealing with harassment**, rather than Veterans directly. 

## Phases of Research

### Phase 1: SME Discussions (mid-late Sept; 60 min over Zoom)
We want to reach out to several SMEs who work with Veterans dealing with harassment and talk with them about the research we're planning. SMEs might include
- Mental health counselors or social workers at VA facilities or VSOs
- Vet Center outreach specialists or counselors 
- VA staff who answer harassment reporting calls from Veterans and/or VA employees
- Patient advocates at the VA

We will talk with the SMEs about what we want to do and get feedback from them on our research approach. The goal is **use the expertise of the SMEs to develop a safe and ethical approach for getting feedback on the harassment tool from Veterans**. 

If an SME thinks this is reasonable to do, we will ask them for names of specific Veterans who they think might feel comfortable participating. We will also invite the SMEs (or a social worker) to observe the sessions with the Veterans they suggest so they can provide support during and/or afterwards as needed. See draft list of questions at the end of this document. 

### Phase 2: Usability Testing with SMEs (late Sept; 60 min over Zoom)
After the prototype has been finalized by Design, Content, and Research, show it to several SMEs to consider from the point of view of a someone who has experienced harassment at the VA. They will be prompted to go through the user tasks in the usbility test.

### Phase 3: Usability Testing with Veterans (early-mid Oct; 60 min over Zoom)
If we have obtained the buy-in of the SMEs and some names or recommendations for Veterans to interview, we will work with Perigean to recruit the participants for usability test sessions. They will be prompted through the same user tasks in the usability test as the SMEs did in Phase 2. 

*If we are advised by SMEs to not test with Veterans*, then the participants in this phase will be SMEs instead, and we will likely need to schedule more sessions. If the SMEs are not Veterans, then Perigean cannot recruit them for us, and our team will need to handle the recruiting logistics workload. 

## Information gathering from SMEs
Below is a list of questions that we would like to ask SMEs.
1. Explain what we want to do (get user feedback on the new online harassment reporting tool) and how (interact with a design prototype on their computer or smartphone). Maybe show some wireframes, if they're ready.
1. What are your thoughts about trying to ask Veterans who may have experienced harassment to give feedback on this prototype? How would you consider the potential for re-triggering the trauma?
    1. If they recommend not talking with Veterans, skip to the last question.
    1. Otherwise, continue with the questions below.
1. What kinds of Veterans do you think we should target in our research? (i.e., female/male, sexual/non-sexual harassment)
1. Who do you think might use a self-service harassment reporting tool like this one vs. call a phone number vs. not report at all?
1. Are there any Veteran groups that are disproportionately harmed/affected by harassment? Who are they and why?
1. Should we allow participants to fill out whatever information they feel like sharing from their own experiences or imagination, or provide fictitious details for them to enter?
1. Do you think it's OK to ask some warm-up questions about harassment experiences before showing the design prototype? If OK, how to ask to get a sense of them without asking for all of the details but let the person be heard.
    1. Have you been harassed at a VA facility before? Are you up for talking about that?
    2. If so, did you report it? How?
    3. How would you prefer to report it? Why?
3. Do you know of any Veterans who might be willing and feel comfortable talking with us about reporting harassment? If so, I can provide a blurb for you to use to ask (i.e., “Would you be willing to participate in an hour-long research session to provide feedback on a new way to report harassment at the VA? If yes, you will be contacted by someone from Perigean Technologies to schedule the session. They are a trusted VA partner.”) 
4. Might you be willing to observe the research session(s) with the Veterans you recommend and provide support during the session(s) and afterwards, if needed?
5. Is there anyone else that you would recommend that I talk with? (who and why?)
