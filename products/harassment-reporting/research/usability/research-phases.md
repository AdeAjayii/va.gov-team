# Research Phases: Harassment Reporting Tool
 	
## Overview	
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on the new online harassment reporting tool. Because harassment is a potential trauma trigger, we want to be careful about recruiting Veterans to participate in this research. To address this ethical concern, we propose to start by talking with **subject-matter experts (SMEs) who work with Veterans dealing with harassment** *before* talking with Veterans directly. 

## Phases of Research

### Phase 1: SME Discussions (late Sept-early Oct; 60 min over Zoom)
We want to reach out to several SMEs who work with Veterans dealing with harassment and talk with them about the research we're planning. SMEs might include
- Mental health counselors or social workers at VA facilities or VSOs
- Vet Center outreach specialists or counselors 
- VA staff who answer harassment reporting calls from Veterans and/or VA employees
- Patient advocates at the VA

I would like to get their input on developing a conversation guide.

We will talk with the SMEs about what we want to do and get feedback from them on our research approach. The goal is **use the expertise of the SMEs to develop a safe and ethical approach for getting feedback on the harassment tool from Veterans**. 

We will also ask the SMEs for names of specific Veterans who they think might feel comfortable participating, and invite the SMEs (or a social worker TBD?) to observe the sessions with the Veterans they suggest so they can provide support during and/or afterwards as needed. See draft list of questions at the end of this document. 

### Phase 2: Usability Testing with Veterans (mid Oct; 60 min over Zoom)
After we have obtained buy-in from the SMEs and ideally some names or recommendations for Veterans to interview, we will work with Perigean to recruit the participants for usability test sessions. After each session, it would be great to have a debrief afterwards with the SME or social worker who attended. 

## Information gathering from SMEs
Explain what we want to do (get user feedback on the new online harassment reporting tool) and how (interact with a design prototype on their smartphone). Maybe show the prototype, if it's ready. 
Below is the list of questions that we would like to ask SMEs.

1. What are your thoughts about trying to ask Veterans who may have experienced harassment to give feedback on this prototype? How would you consider the potential for re-triggering the trauma?
    1. If they recommend not talking with Veterans, skip to the last question.
    1. Otherwise, continue with the questions below.
1. What kinds of Veterans do you think we should target in our research? (i.e., female/male, experienced harassment or not, sexual/non-sexual harassment)
    1. What are your thoughts about hand-picking specific Veterans vs. asking our regular recruitment vendor to find them?
    1. If the latter, what screening questions should we include? Anything about harassment experiences at a VA site?
3. Who do you think might use a self-service harassment reporting tool like this one vs. call a phone number vs. not report at all?
4. Are there any Veteran groups that are disproportionately harmed/affected by harassment? Who are they and why?
5. Should we allow participants to fill out whatever information they feel like sharing from their own experiences or imagination, or provide fictitious details for them to enter?
6. Do you think it's OK to ask some warm-up questions about harassment experiences before showing the design prototype? If OK, how to ask to get a sense of them without asking for all of the details but let the person be heard.
    1. Have you been harassed at a VA facility before? Are you up for talking about that?
    2. If so, did you report it? How?
    3. How would you prefer to report it? Why?
7. How do you recommend that we handle (and recognize) trauma-triggering during a research session? (i.e., Stop session and refer to resources TBD? You or someone else take over?) I would like to learn how to recognize participant distress and how to respond appropriately.
    1. Pay attention to prolonged silences, shifts in tone, and new background noises. If notice any of these changes, ask the participant if they still feel comfortable continuing the session.
    2. Acknowledge their pain. Ask if they're comfortable continuing with the session.
    3. Are there specific resources for support that I should mention to all participants or only those who seem affected/triggered?
8. Do you know of any Veterans who might be willing and feel comfortable talking with us about reporting harassment? If so, I can provide a blurb for you to use to ask (i.e., “Would you be willing to participate in an hour-long research session to provide feedback on a new way to report harassment at the VA? If yes, you will be contacted by someone from Perigean Technologies to schedule the session. They are a trusted VA partner.”) 
9. Might you be willing to observe the research session(s) with the Veterans you recommend and provide support during the session(s) and afterwards, if needed?
10. What do you think would be an appropriate number of people observing the session besides me (the moderator), a notetaker, and you or a social worker? Maybe only 1 other person? That would be 4 people plus the Veteran.
11. What other advice do you have for conducting this type of research?
    1. I already plan to do: Participants can decide whether to have their video on or off, and whether session is recorded. Ask if they're in a safe and private location. Let them know that this research will help others report harassment that occurs at the VA.
13. Can I show you a draft of the conversation guide that I put together with your input? I'd welcome your feedback.
14. Is there anyone else that you would recommend that I talk with? (who and why?)
