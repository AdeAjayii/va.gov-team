## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy. How are you doing today?

Before we begin, I want to make sure that you're comfortable with a few of my teammates assisting me on this call, including a note taker and a social worker (or clinician), [name]. [Name] can jump in to provide support for you, if needed. 

I can tell you a little more about who I am and what we’re doing before we go any further...
I'm a user researcher and as a team we work on making improvements to VA's websites. We reach out to Veterans from time to time to get their input to make sure we're on the right track with the web pages that we're building. VA is working to stop harassment and make our locations and services safer for all. As part of these efforts, our team is exploring an online tool to make it easier for Veterans to report harassment at VA. Your input could help us make the tool easier to use by Veterans like you. You'll try out the tool to report a hypothetical harassment situation, not your own harassment experience.

**Are you comfortable proceeding with this session?**
If no:
- **Is there anything we can do to make you feel more comfortable?**
#### [Get verbal confirmation or end session]

If yes:

Thank you! We’re excited to talk with you today. Before we start, I want to give you an idea of what this session will be like...

- **This session may take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task. Please let me know if you need a break at any time.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing you. We're testing this tool to learn how we can make it better for all Veterans. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. If at any time you don't feel comfortable answering a question, let me know and we'll move on to the next question.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to take a break or stop the session, please let me know.** You can take a break from the session or end it altogether.
- I will be sharing a web page URL with you during the session. **How would you prefer to receive the URL?** 
  - I could read it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, email it to you, or text it to you.
    - *(if email)* Is your current email XYX *(get from participant roster)* ?
    - *(if text)* What is your mobile phone number?
    
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** I use the recording to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately, and I will delete the recording after I complete analysis. We respect your need for confidentiality--we won’t link anything you choose to share in the session to your name or any information that could identify you.
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 


## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" or  your web browser.
  - *(on a phone)* You will be asked to select what you'd like to share. Please choose "Screen" and then "Start now". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.
  - Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - Phone: On the far right is a More button or 3 dots. Tap that and then on Chat or the conversation bubble. 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.

## Protocol for Recognizing & Handing Trauma-Triggering
*OBSERVE the participant's body language, tone of voice, and the environment. SENSE discomfort, anxiety, nervousness, anger, teary/crying, shakiness. Prolonged silences? Shifts in tone or attitude or interactivity? New background noises? Staring into space?* 
*- If notice a change, SAY one of these:*
  - I realize this is hard. Would you like to take a break or stop?
  - I can see that you're upset. This is important to talk about, but we don't need to go there.
  - Would you like me to stop recording?
  - Do you want to just sit here quietly for a few minutes?
  - Would you like to pause, or are you OK with continuing?
  - Is this not a good time for this session?

*Social worker/clinician on the session (or on standby) jumps in to provide support, if needed. Could SAY:* 
- Could you perhaps help, [NAME of social worker/clinician]?

*If I feel teary or emotional, turn off my camera and/or say* "I need to step away for a moment".

*SHARE the Veterans Crisis Line to call, text, or chat anytime day or night (from red box at top of VA.gov web pages).*
  - You can reach out to the Veterans Crisis line via phone call, text, or chat anytime day or night. You can call 800-273-8255 or text 838255.
  - Would you like to stop this session now?

## Warm-up Question - 5 minutes

*NOTE how to share URL: dictate / Zoom chat / email / text* 

Let’s start with a question...
- Where do you typically go to get information about VA benefits?

(Google / Facebook / MHV / eBenefits / Contact center call or email / VA.gov / ________________________)

- *If they mentioned VA.gov*, ASK: When was the last time that you remember going to the VA.gov website?
  - What were you looking for?
  - Where did you look?
  - Did you find what you were looking for?

## Start screen sharing
I would like you to share your screen with me so I can watch you use a website in your web browser. 
*(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*

What kind of device are you using today? *(Phone / Computer)*

I'll have you start from a website that I'm going to (spell/put into the Zoom chat/email/text) for you to click on (URL TBD; interim link: https://preview.uxpin.com/2421e73be8eba75acea37ad3fbdd09bfc147940f#/pages/141512978/simulate/sitemap?mode=vhid). *(If asked, reassure that this is a legitimate link to what I want you to test.)*

Do you see the link? 

This is a demo tool that may not function the way you expect. Some parts of the screen will work, and some will not. 

Before you click/tap anywhere on the screen, I would like you to tell me what you want to do, and I may ask you questions about that, before telling you to go ahead and try it.

While you're looking at this demo tool, I would like you to *talk aloud* as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, what you like, what you dislike, and what you're unsure about. 

## Veteran Tasks

### Task 1: [Find harassment info on VA.gov] - 5 minutes

I'd like you to imagine that you went to a VA medical clinic today for a doctor's appointment, and on your way in and also on your way out, a man said something rude to you and made a sexual gesture that made you feel uncomfortable. You're thinking about how it's bothering you, and you decide that you want to report it. You'd like someone at the VA to talk to this person about what happened and hopefully prevent it from happening to other people. You've heard that you can report harassment from the VA.gov website, though you've never done that before. So you take out your smartphone and try to figure out how.

Before you tap anywhere on the web page displayed on your phone, where might you look for how to report harassment at the VA?

- *Record where: header / top 4 boxes / links below pictures / footer link TBD* 

What would you expect to find there?

Now you can tap to go there.

### Task 2: [Explore landing page] - 5 minutes

What are your impressions of this page?

What would you do here? *(link TBD to reporting form)*

*(If go to "What if I'm not comfortable giving my name" link, note any feedback on phrasing)*

What are your impressions of this page?

What would you do here? *(Sign in to start your report)*

### Task 6: [Check your address] - 5 minutes
Say that you want to check that your address is correct. How would you do that?

*(tap "+" next to "Your information")*

What would you do now?

*(tap Submit)*

*(any comments on the "you've submitted" page?)*

What would you expect to happen now?

What thoughts do you have about what you just did?


## Post-Task Interview - 10 minutes
*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

- What was *helpful* about what you've seen today?

- What was *not* helpful about what you've seen today?

- What would you like to *change* about what you've seen today?

- We would like this harassment reporting tool to meet the needs of ALL Veterans who may have been harassed at a VA site. We would like to know a little more about your experiences with harassment, if you're willing to share. I'm not asking for details, and I don't want you to re-live these difficult experiences. Your feedback today has been valuable, even if you decide to not answer the questions I'm about to ask...
  - Have you been harassed at the VA before--in person, over the phone, or in email or text? This might be catcalling, negative comments about your gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation, or unwanted attention or gestures. You don't need to share any details, and you can stop at any time.
  - If you were harassed, did you report it?
  - If so, *how* did you report it? 
  - If you didn't report it, what were the barriers to you reporting it?
  - How would you prefer to report any future harassment? *(this tool / phone call / in person / _______________)*

*(If they share details of a harassment experience, say "Thank you for sharing your experience; it's helpful for me to hear that.")*

- Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 


## Thank You and Closing - 2 minutes

We really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today.
