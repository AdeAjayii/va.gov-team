# Research Plan: Harassment Reporting Tool
 	
## Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on the new online harassment reporting tool. We would like participants to do the following:
- Find where to go on VA.gov to report a harassment incident
- Look at the harassment information and find the form to report it
- Fill out the form to report harassment  

## Background
If a Veteran experiences an incident of harassment or other inappropriate behavior while at a VA Site, they can report it by calling a phone number at the VA. A recent Congressional act mandated the creation of an online reporting tool, which will be available from the VA.gov website. We would like to get user feedback on this new tool before it launches.

## Research questions
1. Where do users expect to find a harassment reporting tool? 
1. Are they able to find information on harassment on VA.gov?
1. What are users' reactions to the landing page?
1. What are users' reactions to the online reporting form?
1. What are people's preferences for reporting harassment? (ask at end) e.g., in person at the VA, via phone, via form on phone/tablet/computer

## Hypotheses
1. Users will like the convenience of self-service reporting harassment.
1. Users will be able to find the information about harassment on VA.gov.
1. Users will feel comfortable filling out the harassment reporting form.

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants will be given tasks to do using a mobile design prototype in UXPin. All participants will be using smartphones to match the form factor of the prototype.

## Participants and Recruitment	
Because harassment is a potentially triggering subject, we want to be careful about recruiting people to participate in this research. We plan to start by talking with subject-matter experts (SMEs) who work with Veterans dealing with harassment. Such SMEs may include mental health counselors or social workers at VA facilities or Vet Centers who counsel harassment victims, VA staff who field harassment reporting calls from Veterans and/or VA employees, or patient advocates at the VA. We will talk with the SMEs about what we want to do, get feedback from them on our research approach, and ask for names of specific Veterans who they think might feel comfortable participating. Then we will invite the SMEs (or a social worker) to observe the sessions with the Veterans they suggest to provide support during and afterwards as needed.

### Participants to recruit

We also might be able to get from another Veteran the names of Veterans who have experienced harassment at the VA, reported it, and had closure/resolution of their case. 

Ideally we would like to talk with 8 Veterans, but we may proceed instead with 5 SMEs and 5 Veterans.

Ask Perigean to recruit 16? Veterans from the names we provide in order to get 8? completed sessions using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants
- All are Veterans
- All plan to use their smartphone for the session
- At least 3 participants over 60
- At least 2 people with a cognitive disability (e.g., TBI)

### Good to have for participants
- At least 2 people of color
- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 participant 35 or under
- At least 2 people who don't have any degree or vocational training after high school (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least 1 person that has a college degree (to include officer Veterans)
- At least 2 people who live in a rural or remote area
- At least 1 person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least 1 non-native English speaker

### Recruitment requirements for ALL participants
- Have a smartphone and be willing to be complete their interview on that device
- During the session, be willing to share a new web browser window on their phone 
- Have a working microphone on their phone
- Have Zoom downloaded to their phone prior to the session and know how to share their screen

### Additional questions to ask in the screener
- What is your native language? If not English, record as "non-native English speaker".
