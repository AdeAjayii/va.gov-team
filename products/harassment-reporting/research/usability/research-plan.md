# Research Plan: Harassment Reporting Tool
 	
## Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on the new online harassment reporting tool. We would like participants to do the following:
- Find where to go on the VA.gov home page 
- Look at the harassment landing page and find the form
- Fill out the form to report harassment  

## Background
If a Veteran experiences an incident of harassment or other inappropriate behavior while at a VA Site, they can report it by calling a phone number at the VA. A recent Congressional act mandated the creation of an online reporting tool, which will be available from the VA.gov website. We would like to get user feedback on this new tool before it launches.

## Research questions
1. Where do users expect to find a harassment reporting tool? 
  1. Are they able to find it on VA.gov?
1. What are users' reactions to the landing page?
1. What are users' reactions to the online reporting form?

## Hypotheses
1. Users will like the convenience of self-service reporting harassment.
1. Users will be able to find the information about harassment on the VA.gov home page.
1. Users will feel comfortable filling out the harassment reporting form.

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants will be given tasks to do using a design prototype in UXPin. Some participants will be on desktop, and some will be on mobile.
