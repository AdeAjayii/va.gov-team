# Research Plan: Harassment Reporting Tool
 	
## Goals	
The purpose of this research is to get user feedback on the new online harassment reporting tool. We would like participants to do the following:
- Find where to go on VA.gov to report a harassment incident
- Look at the harassment information and find the form to report it
- Fill out the form to report harassment  

## Background
If a Veteran experiences an incident of harassment or other inappropriate behavior while at a VA Site, they can report it by calling a phone number at the VA. A recent Congressional act mandated the creation of an online reporting tool, which will be available from the VA.gov website. We would like to get user feedback on this new tool before it launches.

## Research questions
1. Where do users expect to find a harassment reporting tool? 
1. Are they able to find information on harassment on VA.gov?
1. What are users' reactions to the landing page?
1. What are users' reactions to the online reporting form?
1. What are people's preferences for reporting harassment? (ask at end) e.g., in person at the VA, via phone, via form on phone/tablet/computer
1. What are users' reactions to uploading supporting materials?

## Hypotheses
1. Users will like the convenience of self-service reporting harassment.
1. Users will be able to find the information about harassment on VA.gov.
1. Users will feel comfortable filling out the harassment reporting form.

## Method
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Participants will be given tasks to do using a mobile design prototype in UXPin. All participants will be using smartphones to match the form factor of the prototype.

## Participants and Recruitment	
Because harassment is a potentially triggering subject, we want to be careful about recruiting people to participate in this research. We would prefer to get Veterans who have experienced harassment at the VA and are able to participate in research sessions without re-triggering the trauma that have experienced. Our plans include the following:
- Provide an overview of the session for Perigean personnel to read to potential participants and then ask if they are comfortable participating.
- Work with VA contacts to find social workers or clinicians to observe the sessions with the Veterans and provide support if trauma-triggering occurs. 
- Limit the number of observers in the session.

### Participants to recruit

Ask Perigean to recruit **16** Veterans in order to get **8** completed sessions using the following criteria:

### Must have for participants
- ALL are Veterans
- Comfortable with trying out a harassment reporting tool and sharing their opinions about it
- Have a smartphone and be willing to join our Zoom call from their phone
- Have a working microphone on their phone
- Have the Zoom app downloaded to their phone prior to the session and know how to share their screen
- During the session, be willing to share their web browser window over Zoom

*PERIGEAN: In your reminder calls/emails, could you please mention that they need to **join from their smartphone**, not a computer or tablet?*

### Good to have for participants
- At least 4 people have experienced harassment while applying for, using, or communicating about VA benefits
- At least 4 women
- At least 2 men
- At least 3 people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender
- At least 2 people of color
- At least 1 participant over 60
- At least 1 participant 35 or under
- At least 2 people with a cognitive disability (e.g., TBI)
- At least 2 people who don't have any degree or vocational training after high school (to include enlisted Veterans)
- At least 1 person that has a college degree (to include officer Veterans)
- At least 2 people who live in a rural or remote area
- At least 1 person who lives in a major metropolitan area
- At least 1 non-native English speaker


### Additional questions to ask in the screener
- VA is working to stop harassment and make our locations and services safer for all. As part of these efforts, we are exploring an online tool to make it easier for Veterans to report harassment at VA. Feedback from Veterans like you will help us make sure that this tool meets your needs and is easy to use. Are you interested in trying out this harassment reporting tool and sharing your opinions about it? *(If they answer "yes", ask the next question; if "no", don't recruit them.)*
  - We’re contacting you because you’re a Veteran, not because we believe that you have been harassed. Have you ever experienced any kind of harassment while applying for, using, or communicating about your VA benefits? This can include harassment that happens at a VA location, during a phone or video call, or in written communications. Harassment might be catcalling, negative comments about your gender, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation, or unwanted attention or gestures. *(If they answer "yes", ask the next question)*
    - If you participate in this feedback session, you might get reminded of your own experiences with harassment. Would you feel comfortable participating? *(If they answer "yes", try to recruit them and record "harassed at VA" in Participant Roster and Schedule; if "no", don't recruit them.)*
- What device will you use to join the research session? *(Must be a smartphone and NOT iPad/tablet, computer, or laptop)*
- What is the first language that you learned to speak as a child? *(If not English, record as "non-native English speaker")*
- It is important to us that the services and applications we design meet the needs of all Veterans. We ask the following question to ensure that we conduct feedback sessions with representative populations. Do you identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender? Yes, No, or Decline to Answer? *(Please record  response in Participant Roster and Schedule)*
