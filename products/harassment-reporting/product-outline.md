# Product Outline: Online Harassment Reporting Page & Form

> Up to date [Product Epic is here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/24883).

## Overview

The Office of Resolution Management, Diversity and Inclusion (ORDMI) is the office in-charge VA Wide for processing complaints from Veterans and Employees for alleged Civil Rights Violations as well as for Harassment, Reasonable Accommodations, and other inappropriate behaviors while on a VA Site.

In response to Section 5303 of the Deborah Sampson Act which is part of the Megabus Bill that was passed in January 2021, and new congressional demands for action, ORDMI has been charged with building a secure, online reporting tool on VA.gov that would enable Veterans (to start) and VA employees (later) to report alleged incidents about violations which occur in a VA facility.

(A 2020 Government Accountability Office report showed the VAâ€™s workplace sexual harassment policies were inconsistent and incomplete, including a lack of centralized reporting mechanisms or resources for VA beneficiaries who report sexual harrassment or assault by VA employees or on VA property.)


## Problem Statement

How might we make it easier for Veterans to report incidents of harassment or assault by VA employees or occur on a VA property?


## Assumptions

- Some Veterans will prefer -- for privacy reasons, due to efficiency, etc. -- to complete an online form for reporting incidents versus current means (e.g., in-person at VA facility, call VA, mail Office of Inspector General)
- The online form will be designed to accommodate various use cases for this delicate situation -- e.g. some may want to report an incident confidentially, etc.

## Desired User / Business Outcomes

**Why would a user want to use this?**
- To report an incident in a way that allows for more privacy and anonymity (online vs. in-person), is guided (e.g. the form requires needed information, reducing risk of error) and will increase speed to outcome (e.g. the data will be routed to the correct remediation path).


**With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?**
- There is the possibilty that a "track progress" of report will be a key feature, once systems are in place. 

**Why would your business want this to exist?**
- VA ORDMI has been charged with creating a centralized reporting mechanism and driving awareness about this resource in response to potential increase in reported incidents and perception that VA has not been responsive and transparent about the issue.

**With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?**
- VA ORDMI should be able to more effectively capture, track and report on cases.

## Undesired User / Business Outcomes
- 

## KPIs
- *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
  - Ratio of appropriate/inappropriate disability benefit applications started/completed
  - Ratio of appropriate/inappropriate education benefit applications started/completed
  - % of "How to Apply" wizard content pages resulting in applications started

## Solution Approach

- (1) Develop user flows that outline proposed approach of moving wizards to the Applicaton/Tool landing pages - https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vft-59c95ae5fda7577a9b3184f8/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/6315
- (2) Validate assumptions -- as much as possible -- with usage data (Analytics Team) and user insights (Contact Center)
- (3) Determine if a prototype can/should be built to validate assumptions -- or if we can/should build a live MVP version on site with traffic throttling

## Go-to-market Strategy
- *How are Veterans and others using this product going to know it exists?*
  - Proposed hypotheses make it easier for Veterans to apply for benefits/submit a claim from content pages where they're most likely to end up in their research.  
- *What marketing, outreach, or communications are necessary for this product to be successful?*

## Target Launch Date
- *What is your target launch date of your MVP/iteration?*
  - to be determined
  
- *What is your date for when you'll evaluate impact after launch?*
  - to be determined
