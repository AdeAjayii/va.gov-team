Kick-off meeting with OEI stakeholders and SMEs re proposal to collaborate to use the FOM as foundation for tier 3 office content. 

### [Kick-off deck](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/tier-3-fom/FOM-and-tier-3-proposal-OCTO-OEI-060421.pdf)

Agenda: Proposal - use the FOM data in Salesforce and the FOM mandated content as the source for modernizing baseline office content templates and have a fair system of 'migrating' offices. 

Conclusion: OEI is supportive of this effort and will work with OCTO with SME assistance vis-a-vis FOM - Janet Schiller and Dan Navarro. Janet is the content author/manager of the FOM; Dan is OIT and involved with the Salesforce side of the FOM.

Next steps: Set up first working session call with Janet.
