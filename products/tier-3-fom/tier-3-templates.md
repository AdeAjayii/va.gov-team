# Tier 3 templates

Per tier 3 strategy and high-level plan, we recommend working on Phase 1 first. Phase 1 can be further prioritized/chunked up into 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, as needed. Recommend tackling Phase 2 document experiences separately and later, per high-level plan. 

## Phase 1 - tier 3 templates

### 1.0

All offices page

Office/org landing page

Office about us page

All senior leaders bios page

Search {content category} page - see content categories & content types


### 1.2 - public affairs/press room content types

1.2 page types are public affairs/press room content that need OPIA SME input and participation. Recommend carving these out from 1.0 to develop when business is ready engage.

Speech page

Remarks page

Press release page

Official travel and public schedules page

Press room landing page


## Phase 2 - tier 3 documents templates

These templates provide interim shell HTML pages for document files. More research with VA offices is needed to understand how documents are today managed (e.g., How and where does VA have manage document files - in one, multiple databases, via direct upload to TeamSite pages?
