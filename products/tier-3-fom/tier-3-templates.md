# Tier 3 templates

Per tier 3 strategy and high-level plan, we recommend working on Phase 1 first. Phase 1 can be further prioritized/chunked up into 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2, as needed. Recommend tackling Phase 2 document experiences separately and later, per high-level plan.

## Phase 2 - tier 3 documents templates

These templates provide interim shell HTML pages for document files. More research with VA document creators is needed to understand how documents are today managed (e.g., How and where does VA have manage document files - in one/multiple databases, via direct upload to TeamSite pages? are there template formats for specific types of documents - there doesn't seem to be, but Ryan and I may not have found them in our exploration of the legacy site, WARMS, and pubs library).
