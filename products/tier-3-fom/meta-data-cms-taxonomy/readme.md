# Kinds of meta data for CMS backend tagging for tier 3 

Taxonomy lists should be managed by OCTO Sitewide Content Team, to ensure labels don't become ungrokkably duplicative. But businesses should have an easy way of suggesting/requestion additions in the CMS lists. 

## Content categories and content types within each category

TBD stakeholder input and card sort with tier 3 audiences and authors. Content types drive what tier 3 content template the editor works on, and it will also provide filtering capability in the frontend indexed content searches ("Mother" content search and the "Search {content category}" pages). 

For reference, [see common types of government and VA document types](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/tier-3-fom/publications-and-documents-phase-2/common-types-government-documents.md).

__Content category: Reports, research, and publications__
These seem to be mostly documents, but there may also be some web also.

Content types in "Reports, research, and publications": 

- Financial and performance reports
- Audits
- Research and other studies
- Transparency reports

__Content category: VA communications__

Content types "VA communications":

- Announcement
- Story
- Press release {1.2}
- Remarks {1.2}
- Speech {1.2}
- Official travel and public schedules {1.2}
- _Blog {IF OPIA has a database feed or API for their blog, the team could investigate if it's worth/desirable to include blog posts in the `Search VA communications` content type search index.}_

__Content category: Policies and manuals__
These are mostly documents, but Ryan and I have discovered a few totally or partially HTML examples. The nomenclature for this category of content is the messiest. VA has LOTS of overlapping/duplicative sounding labels. This one will definitely require card sort with tier 3 audiences and document authors. 

- Example: Sometimes when you open a document called "Handbook," the cover page of the document will also refer to itself as a "Directive."  

See a [list of VA document labels found (so far) on the legacy site](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/tier-3-fom/publications-and-documents-phase-2/common-types-government-documents.md#types-of-va-document-contents-and-examples). 

This is the recommended PRE-card sort grouping until the team has results of the nomenclature research. 

Content types in "Policies and manuals":

- Directives
- Guidance and procedures
- Handbooks
- Manuals
- Memorandum
- Policy 
- Proposed rule – open for public comments 
- Proposed rule – closed for public comments 
    - {"Proposed rule" is a content type nomenclature used on Regulations.gov where VA posts things online for public commenting}
- Notice – open for public comments {TBD}
- Notice – closed for public comments {TBD}
    - {"Notice" is a content type nomenclature used on Regulations.gov where VA posts things online for public commenting}
   


## Topics meta data

Topics meta data nomenclature TBD SME input and card sort with tier 3 audiences and authors. 

Could begin with:

- Use the benefits categories as the baseline of topic lables (Health care, Disability, Pension, Education, etc.)
- Include Veteran audience labels used in RS (Women Veterans, LGBTQ+ Veterans, Gulf War Veterans, etc.)
- Include well-known/common VA topics: MISSION Act, Agent Orange, Coronavirus, PTSD, Military sexual trauma, Veteran's Day, Mental health
- Get input from tier 3 audiences of what common topics they look for from VA
- Get input from tier 3 SMEs of what common topics they create content about


## Other meta data 

- Office name (from Salesforce)
- Administration or "VA" for the central offices (from Salesforce)
- Senior leader names (from CMS bios database)
-
