# Release Plan For Rails App

---

## Phase I: Staging Release (User facing environment)

### Planning:
- Desired date range: [date - date] or [duration]
- How will existing users logins be cutover?
        - How will Github authorization work?
        - Is there a new authorized app in Github? 
- How will we roll it out? Will all staging users be immediately directed to the new app?
- Is there an outtage time necessary?
        - If so, how do we communicate this to the users?
        - Proactively include a message banner a few days ahead to alert them to the outtage?
- What is the rollback plan?
- What is the redirect URI that we need to provide the SSOi team?  

### Results:
- Number of users: x
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: x/x
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing

### Planning:
- Desired date range: mm/dd/yy - mm/dd/yy
- Desired number of unique users: x
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: lorem ipsum
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers): [use your KPIs to help guide this. It could be things like abondomnent rate < 20%, reported call center calls < 2 calls, error rate < 5%, etc.]

### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
