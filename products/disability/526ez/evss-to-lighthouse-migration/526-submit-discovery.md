# 526 Submit Endpoint Discovery
This document details the finding for ticket [#57859](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-experience-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/57859) Discovery - EVSS to Lighthouse Migration - submit endpoint

## Questions
### What would it take to migrate this endpoint?ðŸ¤”
#### What data field(s) are being sent and received from the eVSS endpoint by the 526 form?  
API specs for the `POST /form526/v2/submit` endpoint can be found on the eBenefits site at https://www.ebenefits.va.gov/wss-form526-services-web-v2/rest/swagger.yaml. Return values from the endpoint can be found under the `SubmitResponse:` section, and *submitted* values can be found under the `SubmitRequest`. More details on what JSON fields are submitted to the endpoint are referenced [below](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/evss-to-lighthouse-migration/526-submit-discovery.md#can-form-526-switch-to-this-lh-endpoint-without-changes-for-this-service)

#### What is the endpoint in existence in LH that replaces this service?  
API specs for the `POST /veterans/{veteranId}/526` endpoint can be found on the Lighthouse APIs site under the **Disability** section: https://dev-developer.va.gov/explore/benefits/docs/claims?version=current

#### What data field(s) are being sent and received from the new LH endpoint?  
Fields are specified at the above link. Expand the `POST /veterans/{veteranId}/526` section, scroll down to the Request Body section, then click the **Schema** button

#### Can form 526 switch to this LH endpoint without changes for this service?  
No. Here is an [EVSS/LH Mapping worksheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e_UoLN31Uzr9_aG4ByCcuQm3kIq844cg_l0IBJYnfLE/edit?usp=sharing) that details all the differences between their respective JSON requests. A companion doc to this, [526 Submit Questions for EVSS/LH](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z6Cw6MU5fgsjeJ9vuqrk-4xMEkq3LpQ7NbKUq0KNAyk/edit?usp=sharing), has been created and posted to [#vfs-evss-service-migration](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C02CQP3RFFX/p1688410338910259) to initiate conversation (potential follow-up meeting TBA)

#### What is the data structure vets-api is expecting from eVSS?
Vets-api's `submit_all_claim` endpoint [doc](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/va-digital-services-platform-docs/api-reference/#/form_526/postSubmitFormV2) accepts a (somewhat) similar base JSON as EVSS's submit endpoint, but that is also transformed in code between *that* submission and the final EVSS one. See diagram referenced [below](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/disability/526ez/evss-to-lighthouse-migration/526-submit-discovery.md#can-form-526-switch-to-this-lh-endpoint-without-changes-for-this-service)

#### Does data structure LH has in their documentation adhere to that contract?  
No.

#### In vets-api, is this service being used?  
Yes.

#### What is the workflow from form 526?  
This diagram [526 Submission Workflow](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/b93a0b4d-c62b-49b0-8efc-c7e9e4a05d1c/edit?viewport_loc=974,2887,2515,1134,0_0&invitationId=inv_a7c98577-e6f5-4ec2-897b-3b0f6212b08d) shows the path of initial submission from the website to vets-api to the start of the submission service.

#### If there is more than one endpoint being utilized, do we need separate tickets to capture that work? How complex is it?
Along the path from *initial submission* to the start of the *submission service*, we found a callout to the EVSS /paymentInformation GET endpoint that was in need of migrating. Three tickets were put in the Product Backlog for this: [59695](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-experience-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/59695), [59698](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-experience-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/59698), [59702](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-experience-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/59702) (optional, but small lift while we're there)

Along the path from *submission service* start to *EVSS submission*, callouts to EVSS Documents and Claims endpoints were also discovered by Aurora, tickets made here: [57265](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-experience-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/57265), [56361](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/disability-experience-63dbdb0a401c4400119d3a44/issues/gh/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/56361)

***Still to come***...
#### Can our new framework handle the migration?  
##### Can we abstract out eVSS calls?  
##### Can the responses from both eVSS and LH be genericized?  
I believe that the answer to this is a big general Yes, but just needs to be fleshed out a little more. At a high level, I see the usual Flipper feature toggle in disability_compensation.rb's `to_submission_data()` method, to be used with a conditional to access a new translation layer (at the `dis_form` assignment). This new translation layer would essentially start as a copy/paste of `data_translation_all_claim.rb (EVSS::DisabilityCompensationForm::DataTranslationAllClaim)` but then modified to write out the Lighthouse versions of the various parts of the submission request JSON. Although this might not seem like the most D.R.Y. approach, enough has to change in the request JSON to make this a much cleaner approach than, for example, inserting a Flipper conditional at every point along the proceeding call chain (e.g. translate_banking_info(), translate_service_pay(), etc. Especially considering that the JSON this code is building has to be either one format (EVSS) or the other (LH).

There are a lot of open questions at the moment around mapping EVSS to LH, which may take some time to get resolved. However, I think we know enough at this point to at least begin implementation along the above lines, with the changes (of course) gated behind a feature flag.
