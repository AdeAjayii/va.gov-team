File for disability compensation with VA Form 21-526EZ 

Equal to VA Form 21-526EZ (Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits).

Use this form to file a new claim or a claim for increased disability compensation.


> **Toxic exposure and PACT Act**
> 
> The PACT Act is a new law that expands benefits for Veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances by adding to the list of conditions we can automatically assume (or “presume”) was caused by your service. **If this applies to you, we encourage you to file for benefits now.** If you do so before August 10, 2023, and we grant your application, we’ll likely backdate your benefits to the date of the bill signing. This means we’ll pay you the amount you would have received from August 10, 2022 to the date we grant your application.

Follow these steps to get started.

1. Determine if this form is for you 

Use this form if you’re filing a new claim or a claim for increased disability compensation.

Make sure you meet our eligibility requirements before you apply. You may be eligible for VA disability benefits or compensation if you meet these requirements.

**Both of these must be true:**
- You have a current illness or injury (known as a condition) that affects your mind or body, **and**
- You served on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training

**And at least one of these must be true:**
- You got sick or injured while serving in the military, **or**
- You had an illness or injury before you joined the military—and serving made it worse, **or**
- You have a disability related to your active-duty service that didn’t appear until after you ended your service, **or**
- A service-connected illness or injury you already had caused a new injury or illness

>Have you been granted benefits in the past? 
>If you have already been granted benefits, and are filing a claim because your condition has worsened (this is called a claim for increase), you might want to check to see if you’re already receiving the maximum disability rating for your condition. You can do this by signing in and [viewing your claim letters](https://staging.va.gov/track-claims/your-claim-letters).
>You’ll need to [file a Supplemental Claim](https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/supplemental-claim/) **instead of this from** if either of these is true:
- We decided your claim in the past and you have new and relevant evidence, **or**
- You’re requesting a review of your claim based on a change in law (such as the PACT Act)

> **Are you currently on active duty as a service member?**
> 
> If you’re a service member on full-time active duty, this is the right form for you if both of these are true:
> - You have an illness or injury that was caused or made worse by your active-duty service, **and** 
> - Your separation date is in the next 90 to 180 days
> You can use this form to file a claim for disability benefits through the Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) program.
> 
> **Note:** You’ll need to submit service treatment records for the current period of service as well as a [Separation Health Assessment – Part A Self-Assessment](https://www.benefits.va.gov/compensation/dbq_publicdbqs.asp) as part of your claim so we can request your VA exam. Your claim will be delayed until we receive this form. We estimate that it will take you at least 30 minutes to complete this form, and we recommend you download and fill it out on a desktop computer or laptop then return to this form to upload.
> 
> After you file your claim, you’ll need to be available for 45 days after your claim is submitted to complete an exam. [Learn more about Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD)](https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/when-to-file/pre-discharge-claim/).

3. Decide what you’ll claim and gather information

Your disability compensation will be determined based on the nature and symptoms of the condition, severity and duration of the symptoms, and the impact of the condition and symptoms on your employment. 

While processing your claim we will review relevant medical records that you identify and authorize us to (you can give us this permission when you file here). These may include records from Federal facilities such as VA medical centers, State or local government facilities, and/or private doctors or hospitals. In some cases if we need additional documentation we may also ask you to have an exam to help us rate your disability.

We strongly encourage you to submit documentation with your application to help us understand how your injury or illness is connected to your service, and how the condition impacts you and your ability to work. If we previously granted you benefits, and your condition has worsened, we need documentation that shows that increase in severity and the effect that worsening has had on you and your ability to work.

To support your claim, you can upload documentation such as:
- **VA medical records and hospital records.** These could relate to your claimed illnesses or injuries or they could show that your rated disability has gotten worse.
- **Private medical records and hospital reports.** These could relate to your claimed illnesses or injuries or they could show that your disability has gotten worse.
- **Supporting statements.** These could be from family members, friends, clergy members, law enforcement personnel, or people you served with. These statements could tell us more about your claimed condition and how and when it happened or how it got worse.

If you apply here online, you will have the option to include in your application the necessary forms for if you are:
- Authorizing the release of your medical records to VA 
- Claiming posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including based on a personal assault
- Claiming Individual Unemployability

In addition to asking you to provide information about your condition, we will also ask you about your service and other types of pay you may be receiving (retired, separation, and/or disability severance pay).

> **Toxic exposure and PACT Act**
> 
> To get a disability rating, we need to see that your condition connects to your military service. For many conditions we need documentation to see this, but for some conditions we can automatically assume (or “presume”) that your service caused your condition. **If you have what we call a presumptive condition, we don’t need documents showing service caused the condition.** 
>   
> To support a claim for presumptive service connection, you only need to submit documentation showing you served in a location **and** you have a current condition that qualifies as presumptive.
