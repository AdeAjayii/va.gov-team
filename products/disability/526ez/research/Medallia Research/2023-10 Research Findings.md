## Executive Summary 
The purpose of this research is to understand user pain points and areas of improvement when submitting the 526ez application and to evaluate how Medallia survey data can be used in our research practice. 

## Research Goals
1. Identify and understand pain points and areas of improvement in the current user experience. 
   - Where are users getting stuck in the application submission process?
   - Is there a specific task in the application section where this is happening?
   - Do users understand the next steps if an error message occurs in their application process?

2. Evaluate how Medallia survey data can support/extend our research practice.
   - What can we expect to learn from the feedback and intercept responses? What are the limitations and strengths of the data?
   - On what occasions and how frequently should we analyze Medallia data?

## Methodology 
1. Requested data from the Contact Center
2. Narrowed down responses to one month (March 2023) = 300+ responses
3. Identified top pages:
   - Introduction = 117 responses
   - Confirmation = 73 responses
   - Reserves National Guard = 17 responses
   - Veteran Information = 17 responses
   - Military Service History = 13 responses
   - Additional Evidence = 13 responses 
4. Filtered out general responses and focused on those that offered feedback = 150 responses
5. Categorized the topic of feedback
   - Getting help = 45
   - Error messages = 42
   - Content = 26
   - Navigation = 22
   - Evidence = 15
   - Document management = 13
6. Looked further into these categories to identify patterns and findings


## Research Findings
1. Veterans face blockers that require external supportâ€”but sometimes find that help difficult to get. 

2. Certain error messages can lead Veterans to frustrating encounters with the Contact Center. 

3. Error messages block Veterans from filing.  

4. Veterans are finding themselves misrouted to or stuck on the Reserves National Guard (RNG) page.

5. Veterans reported evidence-related challenges throughout the application.
