Introduction
------------

3 minutes, set the stage

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have a notetaker on the line [NAME]. Today we're going to talk about applying for disability benefits using the online form 526. We are going to focus specifically on the part of the flow concerning PTSD today.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

-   This entire session should take up to  (45) 60 minutes.

-   This session will be [insert method that we decide to use e.g. split into two parts. The first part, we'll ask you some questions about your past experience with applying for benefits with the VA. In the second part, we'll give you a scenario and task to apply for disability benefits for PTSD using the online form.]

-   We are aware that this may be a sensitive subject and encourage you to share only what you are comfortable with. If you need to take a break at any point in this session or need any accommodations, please let us know at any time. We also respect your right to stop the session at any time as well.

-   Feel free to ask us questions at any time.

-   In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. The two of us were not on the team that created this form and we assure your feedback will remain anonymous.

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings solely to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.

If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

Start recording.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?

Usability Test Setup
--------------------

5 minutes, setup the test

Thank  you for answering our questions. For the second half of this session, we'd like to give you a fictional scenario for you to work through regarding the 526 form (Application for Disability Compensation).

Once again, we are aware that this may be a sensitive subject and encourage you to share only what you are comfortable with. If you need to take a break at any point in this session or need any accommodations, please let us know at any time. We also respect your right to stop the session at any time as well.

In this session we will work with a made up scenario, so you don't have to use your personal experiences. We will guide you through the scenario. 

(--present scenario here?-- still pending on if we will do this)

### Scenario and Task

Whenever you are ready, please read out loud the scenario we have provided within the chat.

[Scenario here e.g. You are looking to apply for disability compensation for your PTSD...]

For this scenario, we have a task for you to complete. Please read out loud the task we have provided within the chat.

[Task: apply for disability compensation for your PTSD (needs work).]

Do you have any questions about the task?

If talk out loud: As we go through the session, please think out loud and talk about what you're seeing. We can practice this together on the first page of the form.

If no talk out loud: Please complete this task in a way that's most natural to you. We'd like to remind you that there is no time limit and no right or wrong way to complete this. We will not be able to provide you help or assistance on the task itself, so please treat us like flies on the wall. However, if you do get stuck (due to a technical difficulty or cannot find any way to continue forward,) please let us know.

If you do not have any additional questions, please begin the task whenever you are ready.

-   What's praised the most?

-   What advice would you give to a Veteran for this question?

-   Would this be clear or confusing to a Veteran?

-   Is this question a potential trigger? How might you reword it?

### Therapists

-   What parts of the form do you expect could be a potential trigger for veterans with PTSD?

-   How can we make changes to this form, that will make it easier and less of a trigger for veterans to complete it?

-   Do you think most veterans will benefit to get help filling out this form? Are veterans more in risk of being triggered if they do this alone? 

-   What can the VSO or other people helping the veteran, and the veteran themselves do to be best prepared for going through this form? 

-   In what areas do you typically see that veterans need most support, when going through processes like this?
