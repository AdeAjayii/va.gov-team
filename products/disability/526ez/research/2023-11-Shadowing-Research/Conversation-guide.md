# Conversation Guide 

## Moderator logistics
### 2-3 days before the session
- Review VA Platform's Research Checklist.
- Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study (List them below)
  Assign and confirm notetaker(s)
- This should include a member of your team but could include others. Ask your notetaker(s) to review guidance on taking notes. If you can’t find someone to take notes, Perigean is available to assist. Learn how to prepare for Perigean to take notes.
Prepare for note-taking
- Create a “session notes” folder within your research study Github folder and store each session as a .md document. Copy the conversation guide over to your .md file before each session so that you have a structured way to capture your notes.
Invite observers
- Invite your team and stakeholders to sessions. Limit your observers to 3-4 per session so participants aren’t overwhelmed. You should empower participants by allowing them to decide if they are comfortable having observers. Ask observers to review information about observer guidelines and attendance etiquette.
Prepare as moderator
- Be familiar with the conversation guide, study implement(s), and prototype(s). Review tips on moderating, guidelines for recording sessions, and guidance on participant and researcher safety and exit strategies.
Confirm participant knows what technology they need for the session
- If we have access to participant communications or reconfirm with Perigean that the participant has been informed
Confirm Zoom is recording to the cloud.
Assign timekeeper from observers?
