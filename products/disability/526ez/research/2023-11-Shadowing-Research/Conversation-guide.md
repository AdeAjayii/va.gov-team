# Conversation Guide 

## Moderator logistics
### 2-3 days before the session
- Review VA Platform's Research Checklist.
- Complete any project-specific setup tasks for this study (List them below)
   - Assign and confirm notetaker(s)
      - This should include a member of your team but could include others. Ask your notetaker(s) to review guidance on taking notes. If you can’t find someone to take notes, Perigean is available to assist. Learn how to prepare for Perigean to take notes.
   - Prepare for note-taking
      - Create a “session notes” folder within your research study Github folder and store each session as a .md document. Copy the conversation guide over to your .md file before each session so that you have a structured way to capture your notes.
   - Invite observers
     - Invite your team and stakeholders to sessions. Limit your observers to 3-4 per session so participants aren’t overwhelmed. You should empower participants by allowing them to decide if they are comfortable having observers. Ask observers to review information about observer guidelines and attendance etiquette.
   - Prepare as moderator
      - Be familiar with the conversation guide, study implement(s), and prototype(s). Review tips on moderating, guidelines for recording sessions, and guidance on participant and researcher safety and exit strategies.
   - Confirm participant knows what technology they need for the session
      - If we have access to participant communications or reconfirm with Perigean that the participant has been informed
   - Confirm Zoom is recording to the cloud.
   - Assign timekeeper from observers?

### Day of the session
- Use #feedback-backchannel in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.
- Mute your Slack notifications.
- Send out the observer instructions to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into #feedback-backchannel).

### Starting the session
- In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.
- In the Participant "more" menu, make sure "Play Join and Leave Sound" is unchecked
- Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.
- When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

## Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. We’re a [ROLE] and [ROLE] with VA. I also have a couple of other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them...

Today we're going to talk about the experience of starting the 526EZ application and observe your process of completing the form.

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:

- This session is scheduled to last for up to two hours. You are welcome to take any breaks you need or end the session early.  Most of our time together will be observing you working on the 526, but we will start and end our time together with some questions to learn more about you. 
- In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
- I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was all right to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
   - If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
   - If yes: Admit observers.
   - Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. (This is meant to humanize the interaction of observation for the participant.)
      - “Hi, I’m [NAME], and I’m a [ROLE] with the [PROJECT] team at VA.”
- Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth
- Is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this) or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
   - Knowing that, is it okay with you if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
Start recording.
- I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Do I have your permission to record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
