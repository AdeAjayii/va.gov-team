## Research Goals
Disability compensation is often the first VA "service" that Veterans will come into contact with, setting a precedent for their future experiences. 526EZ is one of the most-used and longest forms on VA.gov. 
526 has many known pain points and multiple teams working on improvements. While there is continual user testing of features within the form, we were missing the Veteran perspective on end-to-end filing. 
* **Goal 1:** Assess the current user experience of applying for disability benefits. 
* **Goal 2:** Identify the pain points that lead to uncertainty, distrust, form exits, multiple sessions, and abandonment.
* **Goal 3:** Learn how Veterans plan for and adapt to the length and complexity of the 526. 

The most relevant touchpoints in the Veteran’s journey are Taking care of myself, Putting down roots, and Retirement. 

## Research Questions
* **Goal 1:** Assess the current user experience of applying for disability benefits. 
   * How easy is it to use the design the first time? Can Veterans understand what they need to do?
       * How does the Veteran’s experience change from the beginning of the form to later sections? 
   * How quickly can Veterans perform tasks?
   * Are there many user errors that are easy to make, and can they easily recover? (Efficiency)
   * How do Veterans feel about their experience?

* **Goal 2:** Identify the pain points that lead to form exits, multiple sessions, and abandonment.
    * What are the blockers that are preventing Veterans from completing the form in one session? 
    * Are certain parts of the form a heavier burden to complete than others? If so, why?
    * Where might the form be relying too much on memory and recall?

* **Goal 3:** Learn how Veterans plan for and adapt to the length and complexity of the 526. 
    * How can we best prepare Veterans for what’s ahead in the form so that they can plan accordingly?
    * What are Veterans' expectations for completing the 526ez before getting started? 
        * Where did they get their information? 
    * Do Veterans intend to finish in a single session, or do they plan for breaks?
        * Do they time-box work on an application, or do they have other milestones such as finishing a specific section?
    * What do Veterans do when they have a question or need assistance? 
    * (After completing the form) How well does their plan hold up? Did their approach or mindset change throughout the experience? Does anything surprise them?

## Methodology
We facilitated 11 semi-structured interviews via Zoom and observed Veterans filling out the 526ez form. During the sessions, Veterans shared their screens and thought aloud as they filled out the form using their personal information with the intention of filing.

Structure of the sessions (capped at 2 hours):
* 10 minutes for introduction and questions about preparation/expectations for the 526
* 90 minutes for shadowing Veterans during form completion with the moderator asking occasional questions (with a 5-minute break at the hour mark)
* 10 minutes for reflection questions and wrap-up.

**Limitations**

Although we met with 11 Veterans, the findings in this report are based on the 5 participants who started the 526. The other participants were not ready to file or were looking to file a different type of claim such as an appeal or supplemental claim. 
* Of the 5 who started, 3 successfully submitted a claim while 2 stopped at Step 3 Evidence. 
* Three were first-time filers who had never submitted a claim before, while 2 had submitted previously (in paper and online).
* Due to the small sample size, we cannot conclude this is representative of all Veterans.

**Learnings**
* While shadowing provides meaningful “real life” data, it took longer than anticipated to observe Veterans filing. If a participant struggled with authentication or hit an ITF error, we had no way to unblock them. We increased our number of participants mid-study to ensure the proper sample size was able to start the form. 
* Many Veterans expected the researcher to help them file—not just observe the experience. For future work, we will make sure our recruitment language sets clear expectations. 

## Thematic Findings
**Finding #1**
**Participant’s existing level of trust in VA informed how they reacted to uncertainty throughout the filing experience. **
* Some participants view unclear language or usability issues as further proof of VA’s malintent.
    * “There is built-in ambiguity… because of the necessary precision they’ve mandated in the past… If you don't put exactly what they want it is probably a mechanism they can use to reject your claim.” -P11
* Other participants—especially those claiming for MST—doubt that VA will be able to retrieve evidence and fairly evaluate complex claims. 
    * “I personally have no faith. To be totally honest, I might not get any benefits because it was so long ago … I don't think that we as older Veterans have faith in the VA system and being able to provide the evidence we need.” -P21
    * “When you think you have enough information to support a complex claim, get more. Save everything you send to the VA and vice versa.” -P18
* Conversely, participants who have had good outcomes with VA in the past might have an easier time completing the form by assuming goodwill. 
    * One participant, who liked their local VA facility, was confident that VA would follow up if something was confusing or missing from their claim—a strong contrast to the feelings of other participants. 
    * “I was able to fill out what I thought was the right information, with the assumption that if I've done something the VA doesn't understand I will be contacted for more information.” -P6
* Veterans who have filed previously online or paper found filing easier than in previous experiences.
    *“Quite frankly, my experience with VA in the past has been pretty cumbersome and many times ungood. This was much easier. So thank you for your work on this.” P6
