## Research Goals
Disability compensation is often the first VA "service" that Veterans will come into contact with, setting a precedent for their future experiences. 526EZ is one of the most-used and longest forms on VA.gov. 
526 has many known pain points and multiple teams working on improvements. While there is continual user testing of features within the form, we were missing the Veteran perspective on end-to-end filing. 
* Goal 1: Assess the current user experience of applying for disability benefits. 
* Goal 2: Identify the pain points that lead to uncertainty, distrust, form exits, multiple sessions, and abandonment.
* Goal 3: Learn how Veterans plan for and adapt to the length and complexity of the 526. 
The most relevant touchpoints in the Veteranâ€™s journey are Taking care of myself, Putting down roots, and Retirement.
