# Research Plan for Benefits and Claims Disability Experience Team, 526ez Shadowing, September 2023
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
Disability compensation is often the first VA "service" that Veterans will come into contact with, setting a precedent for their future experiences. 526EZ is one of the most-used and longest forms on VA.gov. 
526EZ is a long-form with many known pain points and multiple teams working on improvements. While there is continual user testing of subsections and pages within the form, we don’t have a clear sense of the end-to-end experience for Veterans as they fill in their own information (vs mock data and scenarios during testing).
