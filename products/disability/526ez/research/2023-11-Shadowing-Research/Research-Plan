# Research Plan for Benefits and Claims Disability Experience Team, 526ez Shadowing, September 2023
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
Disability compensation is often the first VA "service" that Veterans will come into contact with, setting a precedent for their future experiences. 526EZ is one of the most-used and longest forms on VA.gov. 
526EZ is a long-form with many known pain points and multiple teams working on improvements. While there is continual user testing of subsections and pages within the form, we don’t have a clear sense of the end-to-end experience for Veterans as they fill in their own information (vs mock data and scenarios during testing).

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter?
Getting out: Engaging VA to access benefits and services
Taking care of myself: Managing primary care and chronic health issues

### Research Goals
In this study, we aim to observe Veterans filling out their own disability claims with real data in order to better understand the end-to-end user experience.  We will assess the clarity and usability of the 526ez in its current state as well as uncover pain points that do not surface in structured, feature-specific testing. 
This study will also serve as a pilot for regular observational research to capture changes and updates.
Goals:
- Goal 1: Assess the current user experience of applying for disability benefits. 
- Goal 2: Identify the pain points that lead to uncertainty, distrust, form exits, multiple sessions, and abandonment.
- Goal 3: Learn how Veterans plan for and adapt to the length and complexity of the 526. 

### Outcome
Much of the current effort around 526ez is focused on stability, technical debt, and ensuring parity with the paper form. We don't have a consistent and methodical way to validate our design debt—which can be as significant as technical debt for some users in terms of blocking access to their earned benefits. 
The research will give us insight into the holistic experience of completing the 526ez and highlight opportunities for improvements at a form level.  Findings will also support the validation and prioritization of design debt. 

### Research questions
Goal: Assess the current user experience of applying for disability benefits. 
- How easy is it to use the design the first time? Can Veterans understand what they need to do? (Learnability)
- How does the Veteran’s experience change from the beginning of the form to later sections? 
- How quickly can Veterans perform tasks? (Efficiency)
- Are there many user errors that are easy to make, and can they easily recover? (Efficiency)
- How do Veterans feel about their experience? (Satisfaction)
