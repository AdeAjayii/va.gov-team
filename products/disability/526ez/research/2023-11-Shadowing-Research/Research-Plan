# Research Plan for Benefits and Claims Disability Experience Team, 526ez Shadowing, September 2023
*Questions about how to set up your research study? Reach out in the #research-ops Slack channel.* 

## Background
Disability compensation is often the first VA "service" that Veterans will come into contact with, setting a precedent for their future experiences. 526EZ is one of the most-used and longest forms on VA.gov. 
526EZ is a long-form with many known pain points and multiple teams working on improvements. While there is continual user testing of subsections and pages within the form, we don’t have a clear sense of the end-to-end experience for Veterans as they fill in their own information (vs mock data and scenarios during testing).

### OCTO Priorities
Which OCTO priorities does this research support? Work with your VA lead and product manager as needed.
2. Solidify the VA.gov platform
6. Enhance Veterans’ personalized online experience
7. Fast-track disability claims, starting with PACT Act claims

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the Veteran journey? Are there moments that matter?
Getting out: Engaging VA to access benefits and services
Taking care of myself: Managing primary care and chronic health issues

### Research Goals
In this study, we aim to observe Veterans filling out their own disability claims with real data in order to better understand the end-to-end user experience.  We will assess the clarity and usability of the 526ez in its current state as well as uncover pain points that do not surface in structured, feature-specific testing. 
This study will also serve as a pilot for regular observational research to capture changes and updates.
Goals:
- Goal 1: Assess the current user experience of applying for disability benefits. 
- Goal 2: Identify the pain points that lead to uncertainty, distrust, form exits, multiple sessions, and abandonment.
- Goal 3: Learn how Veterans plan for and adapt to the length and complexity of the 526. 

### Outcome
Much of the current effort around 526ez is focused on stability, technical debt, and ensuring parity with the paper form. We don't have a consistent and methodical way to validate our design debt—which can be as significant as technical debt for some users in terms of blocking access to their earned benefits. 
The research will give us insight into the holistic experience of completing the 526ez and highlight opportunities for improvements at a form level.  Findings will also support the validation and prioritization of design debt. 

### Research questions
Goal: Assess the current user experience of applying for disability benefits. 
- How easy is it to use the design the first time? Can Veterans understand what they need to do? (Learnability)
- How does the Veteran’s experience change from the beginning of the form to later sections? 
- How quickly can Veterans perform tasks? (Efficiency)
- Are there many user errors that are easy to make, and can they easily recover? (Efficiency)
- How do Veterans feel about their experience? (Satisfaction)

Goal: Identify the pain points that lead to form exits, multiple sessions, and abandonment.
- What are the blockers that are preventing Veterans from completing the form in one session? 
- Are certain parts of the form a heavier burden to complete than others? If so, why?
- Where might the form be relying too much on memory and recall?

Goal: Learn how Veterans plan for and adapt to the length and complexity of the 526. 
- How can we best prepare Veterans for what’s ahead in the form so that they can plan accordingly?
- What are Veterans' expectations for completing the 526ez before getting started? 
- Where did they get their information? 
- Do Veterans intend to finish in a single session, or do they plan for breaks?
- Do they time-box work on an application, or do they have other milestones such as finishing a specific section?
- What do Veterans do when they have a question or need assistance? 
- (After completing the form) How well does their plan hold up? Did their approach or mindset change throughout the experience? Does anything surprise them?

### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.

Veterans will experience issues that will slow their progress through the form and lead to mistakes or feelings of uncertainty.
- Certain aspects/features will not be clear to Veterans, which will leave them feeling uncertain about their claim and resulting ratings. 
- Veterans who haven't used the online tool before will experience a learning curve, and become more adept at navigation and data entry as they go along.
- Veterans will not understand why they have to populate all of their personal information (when they believe the VA already has it).
- Task efficiency will go down when recall or additional documentation is needed to advance.

Pain points such as error messages, required service information/evidence, user fatigue and form length contribute to exits, session number, and abandonment. 
- According to DOMO data, about half (57.5%) of Veterans will complete the form in one session while a quarter (26.8%) will require 2 sessions with the remainder needing 3 or more [average length=1.73 in July-Aug ‘23]
- Evidence requirements are challenging to understand and the documentation is difficult to locate and request. Uploading files can be a struggle, adding to Veteran frustration and feelings of uncertainty about the completeness of their application.
- [Hypothesis also informed by Medallia data around major blockers in the form of error messages and challenging experiences trying to resolve challenges with the Contact Center]

Veterans who review the process and prepare the material they need in advance are more likely to complete the form in one session. 
- When Veterans are uncertain about what documentation they will need to complete the 526, they have to spend more time collecting it mid-way, which lengthens the process. 
- Veterans turn to VA representatives—from VSOs to Contact Center employees—in order to complete their forms and resolve problems mid-application.
- Social media, family, and friends serve as a source of information for troubleshooting issues and information sharing among Veterans.
- The form takes most Veterans much longer than the estimated 25-minute burden to complete.
