When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro

Intro - 5 minutes
Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and [NOTETAKER NAME] is taking notes. I also have a couple other colleagues in the Zoom waiting room who would like to observe and take notes. But before we get to them, I’ll tell you about myself and what we’re doing today.

My colleagues and I work on VA.gov - making improvements to the site so that Veterans can submit their strongest claims and get benefits as quickly as possible. What I hope to do today is to get a sense of how to best assist Veterans in deciding what claims to file. What I don’t want to do is to add to any frustration you may have had with getting benefits. We may look at things that have caused you frustration in the past, and I want you to know up front that I can’t have an impact on your personal situation. However, I do want to hear about your frustrations with the website in case they are with things that we can improve on in the future.  

Before we start, I have a few things that I want to go over with you:
This entire session should take about 60 minutes. I want to be sure that we end on time, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions. There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
Your participation in this interview is completely voluntary. You do not have to participate if you don't want to. Whether you choose to participate or not will not affect your benefits in any way with the VA. If you would like to stop the session or do not want to answer a question for any reason at any time, that's no problem. Please let me know.
I know the folks who invited you to participate in this interview asked if it was alright to allow people to observe this interview, but I want to double-check with you before we get going. Are you okay with a couple of additional observers during this session?
 If no: Use Slack to kindly ask the observers to leave the Zoom.
 If yes: Admit observers.
 Then, ask the notetaker and observers to give a brief, camera-on introduction, like their first name and position with VA.gov. 
 Once complete, ask the notetaker and observers to turn off their cameras for the remainder of the session to save bandwidth

Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. After we complete the analysis, the recordings are destroyed, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. We either report findings out in groups (i.e., 5 out of 10 participants said this), or if we want to quote you directly, we take away any identifying information and give you a participant ID, like P7.
Knowing that, are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?
 If yes: Once I start recording, I’ll ask again for your confirmation.

Would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veterans’ experiences? One of the ways that we share findings with our partners across the VA is by showing short video clips of sessions with Veterans. In these video clips, we blur out any information that could possibly be used to identify you, like your onscreen image. Sharing these video clips can be a compelling way for our partners to better understand what Veterans go through when using VA.gov and our digital products. These clips will not be shared outside of the VA. We don't know at this point if we will or not, but we like to ask ahead of time. At the end of the interview, I'll also confirm that this is okay with you, so you will get a chance to veto this once you know what we've discussed.
Knowing this, would you be comfortable if we decided to use a clip of our session with you to help our partners understand Veteran's experiences?
 If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are okay with me recording this session once more.
 
Start recording & start the transcription.

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes
Before we look at the website, let’s start with a few background questions.
Talk to me about your past experience using VA.gov?
Could you tell me about the types of benefits you are receiving from the VA at this time? 
 
 If they are getting disability compensation from the VA right now, ask:
About how many conditions are you receiving benefits for?
If you’re comfortable sharing this information, what are some of those conditions?

Great! Now let’s get into evaluating some prototypes.
We’re going to show you a couple of screens that we’re working on.
These prototypes are not the real website, and they may not function exactly the way you expect. 
Some areas of the prototype will be clickable and some will not. 
And, since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.

Also, the screens you’ll see are designed for a mobile phone. If you’re using a laptop or a monitor, they’re going to look really narrow. Don’t worry about that, it’s just an effect of this being a rough prototype.

We’re going to go through 2 different scenarios. For both scenarios, I’d like you to imagine that you’re currently receiving disability benefits from the VA for several service-connected health conditions, and some of those conditions have gotten worse. You’ve come to the VA website today to ask for more compensation for those conditions.

Now, I’m going to put a link to the [prototype](https://www.sketch.com/s/bf1a0cd3-1fae-4321-a081-82db48fa3d3a/p/E089E059-6A52-43B0-9D5D-8B3FE35E4667/canvas#About) in the Zoom chat. You can click on that link. Once you have that open, please share your screen so we can see what you’re doing. 
 Wait for screen sharing to work.

 Moderator note: review which scenarios to provide the participant in the spreadsheet beforehand

Scenario 1: Review currently rated conditions - 15 minutes

If this is the 1st task:
Your Tinnitus and Asthma has gotten worse, so you’re coming to the website to determine what you should do next. You’d like to review what disability benefits you are already receiving. I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. 

If this is the 2nd task: 
Similar to the last task, in this scenario your Tinnitus and Asthma has gotten worse. You’re coming to the website to look for more information.

Screen 1 (Start)
Do you have any questions before you start?
Go ahead and click Start.

Screen 2 (Authenticated Home) 
Talk me through what you would do on this screen if you wanted to learn more about what your current rating is.
Observe how the participant makes it to the rated disabilities screen…

Screen 3 (View my Rated Disabilities Screen)
I have a few questions for you on this screen.
What is this screen telling you? What is your initial impression of it?
What can you tell me about the conditions on this screen?
What do you think about your eligibility for more benefits?
Can you tell me about which conditions are already at the maximum rating?
What do you think you would do after reading the message about ratings at the highest level?
What do you think you might do after reviewing this screen?
This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell me if reading that information would influence your decision to file a claim for increase? 

Things to watch for:
Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus? 
How do they react to seeing a condition (migraines) that’s also at the max rating?

Scenario 2: Request CFI for Tinnitus - 15 minutes 

If this is the 1st task: 
Your Tinnitus has gotten worse, so you’re planning to ask for more compensation. I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. Also note that in the prototype, we are starting you in the middle of the claims process just to save time.  

If this is the 2nd task: 
Similar to the last task, in this scenario your Tinnitus has gotten worse and you’re planning to ask for more compensation.

Screen 1 (Start)
Do you have any questions before you start?
Go ahead and click Start.

Screen 2 (Veteran Details screen)
Go ahead and show me how you would get started.

Screen 3 (New or Increase) → Screen 4 (New or Increase)
Talk me through what you would do on this screen.

Screen 5 (Select conditions)
Thanks for that! I have a few questions for you on this screen before you proceed.
What can you tell me about the conditions on this screen?
What do you think about your eligibility for more benefits?
Can you tell me about the header that mentions maximum ratings - what does that mean to you?
What does the phrase ‘Maximum Possible Rating’ mean to you?
What do you think you would do next?
Encourage participant to open expando if they have not already
What is this text telling you? What do you think you would do after reading it?
This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell me if reading that information would influence your decision to file a claim for increase? 

Things to watch for:
Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus? 
Do they find knowing the maximum possible rating for all conditions helpful/useful?

Scenario 3: Request CFI for Tinnitus with Friction - 15 minutes 

If this is the 1st task: 
Your Tinnitus has gotten worse, so you’re planning to ask for more compensation. I’d like you to walk us through what you would do on this prototype. Please think aloud as much as you can while you are walking us through this process. And we’re not in a hurry, so take as much time as you would if you were actually doing this for yourself. Also note that in the prototype, we are starting you in the middle of the claims process just to save time.

Encourage participant to select ‘Tinnitus’ even if they say they wouldn’t.
Can you tell me what this page is about?
Encourage participant to open expando if they have not already
What is this text telling you? 
What do you think you would do next?
This is the last screen for this prototype. Before we go to the next one, can you tell me if reading that information would influence your decision to file a claim for increase? 

Things to watch for:
Does the intervention discourage them from claiming tinnitus? 

Compare prototypes
Now that you’ve looked at the two different prototypes, can you tell me about the differences in how you experienced each of them?

Between these two prototypes, which do you think would be more likely to influence your decision about whether or not to submit a claim for increase on Tinnitus?

Consent to use video clips
I want to circle back and re-confirm that you are comfortable if we were to share a video clip of this session with our VA partners? Just to remind you, we will remove all information that could be used to identify you before sharing and will only share the videos with VA partners with the purpose of improving VA.gov and other digital experiences.
 If yes: Is there any part of our discussion you would NOT want shared in a video clip?

Thank-You and Closing - 5 minutes
Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans. I just want to check once more that you are still feeling good about us using your feedback or if you would like to redact anything we discussed today?
Thanks! Lastly, Perigean will be sending you a thank you note with a little blurb that you can pass along to other Veterans you may know to provide them the chance to participate in future research studies.
Thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!

Emergency Exit
Well, we have covered all of the questions I had for you today. Thank you so much for your time and feedback!
