This topline summary is a result of the synthesis that happens after conducting/observing research sessions. This is a high level summary of trends and analysis, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered.                         The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

The goal of this document is:

-   To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings

-   To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

Research Questions & Answers
----------------------------

Previous experience with a BDD claim

For the participants that have filed or started to file a BDD claim, how was this experience? 

-   Two participants had filed a BDD claim before, one had just started the process 

-   The participants used VSO, but did not find the process to be very clear. 

"It was not easy to figure out what conditions are indeed accepted for benefits".

-   They felt there was a lot of waiting with not enough updates about the progress. 

-   Participants want a status tracker or a dashboard to see the claim progress/status/changes.

-   Participants want to see what step they are in, where in the process they are and how many steps are left. 

-   Participants also want to see a timeline and a time estimate. 

-   Two participants mentioned the Domino pizza tracker as an example of a useful status tracker.  

Task 1. Wayfinding task

How do participants try to find information about the BDD program? 

-   Most participants can't find any info about the BDD program by navigating through the menus and the UI.

-   Participants go to the Search bar to find info on BDD. They type in BDD if they have heard the term, if not, they type in some version of: "benefits before discharge". They find the Pre-discharge page. A few participants initially skipped over this link.

-   Participants are confused by the fact that both the term Pre-discharge claim and the term Benefits Delivery at Discharge is used. They would like to only have one name for this program.

How do participants navigate when they want to file a BDD claim?

-   Most participants don't have a problem navigating to the disability claim page by clicking the following: the dropdown VA Benefits and Healthcare dropdown - Disability  - How to file a disability claim. 

-   All participants find the Get started button on the page and understand that this is the call-to-action for starting the process of filing for a claim.

What do participants think about the How to file a disability claim page?

-   All participants find the call to action button, although some use need some more time to find it. 

-   One participant thinks there are a lot of internal VA terms on this page. (For example: what is a Fully developed claim?)

-   One participant would like to be able to get to the call-to-action button without scrolling. 

What do participants think about the Pre-discharge claim page? (current BDD info page)

-   A few participants are looking for a button to file a claim on this page. 

-   One participant questioned why he needs to be sent back to the previous page (How to file a disability claim) in order to start the claim.  

-   Participants feel that the amount of text on this page is overwhelming. 

"This blue box is awfully cramped!" 

What do participants think about the mockup of a new Pre-discharge claim page?  

-   Although there were a few participants that preferred the current page, most participants preferred the new mockup page.

-   Most participants liked that there was less text on the new mockup page and found it to be cleaner, more to the point and less overwhelming. 

-   All participants liked the inclusion of a video about BDD.

-   participants did prefer the gray box with Other benefits on the current page.

Task 2. File a BDD claim

-Participants were asked to file a BDD claim when on the How to file a disability claim page. The first 2 participants used an Invision prototype due to technical issues, the rest went through the BDD flow in staging.

Overall, what do participants experience as they go through the BDD flow?

-   Most participants find it relatively short, straightforward and easy to go through.

"It was way easier than I ever imagined" 

"This process was pretty quick"

-   Most of the participant comments in the BDD flow up until the claim exam page, was  related to confusing copy. 

-   The other usability issues are found on the claim exam page (under the Supporting evidence section) and on the Submission page. 

What usability issues are the participants experiencing in the BDD flow?

Military history

-   One participant found the copy on the Military history page confusing, if this is the first time he would have registered with VA : "This is the military history we have on file for you". The participant found this sentence confusing, since the page is empty. It only makes sense if the page was pre-populated. 

New Conditions

-   Two participants found it confusing that we ask for "...new conditions to add to your claim?" when this is their first time submitting a claim. 

Supporting evidence

-   One participant found this sentence confusing as he had not filed a claim yet: "Is there any new evidence you like us to review as part of your claim?"

"I am asked to add new evidence to my claim, but I don't have a claim yet! I am making my first claim now" 

Bank account

-   Looking at the bank account page, one participant suggests to add information about the security level on the page. 

Claim exam

-   Participants find the copy on the Claim exam page under Supporting evidence too blunt and not polite. 

-   Several participants would like the phone number listed or at least see the area code of the incalling phone number. 

-   Participants want a time estimate for the call.

-   Participants would like a voice mail with a call back number. 

-   A few would also like to see an email address here.

"Instead of telling us that (...if you missed our call) they will do as they please, I would like to read: '..in order to hold your place in the line, we will schedule an appointment for you.' Being an adult, I also want to be able to reschedule my appointment".    

Review page

-   Participants find the review page and the submission page is more or less as they expected.

-   They like that they can edit directly on the review page. 

Submission page 

-   Participants value the print button and the tracking option. 

-   In the tracking tool, they want to see what has happened, what is the status, what step their claim is in, what will happen next, and how many steps are left. 

-   Some participants expected to see a claim number on the submission page. 

-   If this is not given, one participant suggests to inform that the claim is tracked by social security number.

-   Participants would like an email confirmation.

Other Findings
--------------

-   Participants were confused by several terms, such as: Fully developed claim, An intent to file, Special handling.

"I don't know what a Fully developed claim is. What is the difference between this and a normal claim?"

"What is an intent to file? Does it mean that I now will overwrite my older claim?"

Participants are very positive about having a video on the page if it's relevant and informal.
