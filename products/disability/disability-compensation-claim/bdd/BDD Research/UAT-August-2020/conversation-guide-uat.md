- When their screen is shared, send the beta link https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/
- **Note: We will not be recording these sessions**.

## Intro - 2 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Christian and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about how to apply for a disability benefit with the VA before you have discharged from your military commitment.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 30-45 minutes, depending on how many contentions you will be claiming.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** If you find something we show you to be confusing, we want to hear about it. Your honest insights help us to figure out how we can improve the veteran experience, and we will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** You will not be penalized in any way if we need to stop.

## Warm-up/Screener Questions - 3 minutes

OK,let's get started.

1. First, can you tell me a little bit about yourself? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).
2. Have you heard of BDD before this session?
3. Next, I'd like to confirm: You are separating from the military between X-Y days? (answer depends on whether this is for 90-180 or 1-89)
- **If no, the participant can not complete UAT**. Confirm/probe if they seem confused, but if they are sure they are not separating within the expected window, we can let them go.
4. Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon? 
5. Do you know your username and password? 
  - If not: Are these readily accessible? Could get them?
  - If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, end the session.
6. Can you tell me what type of computer you are using today? 
  - If needed: I'm asking this question because sometimes the type of computer can affect your experience with the tools. Knowing which one you are using will help our developers make adjustments if needed. 
7. Can you tell me which web browser you are using?
8. Today we are going to observe you interacting with the new tools on your computer. Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen with me at this time?  
  - If no: Explain this is necessary for testing. If they are still unwilling, end the call.

**(Pass presenter rights).**

OK, please share your screen, and then we will get started.
