# Release Plan Benefits Delivery at Discharge
## Phase I: moderated production testing (also known as User Acceptance Testing, or UAT)

### Planning:
- Desired date range or test duration: [June 1 - June 15]
- Desired number of users: 5
- How you'll recruit the right production test users: Personal contacts, work contacts
- How you'll conduct the testing: With front end and back end support to ensure the technical aspects of the BDD integration with MVI is working (very similar to Original Claims).
- How you'll give the test users access to the product in production w/o making it live on VA.gov: On production it will be hidden behind a different intro page.

### Results:
- Number of users: XXX
- Number of bugs identified / fixed: XXX
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: XXX
- Types of errors logged: XXX to any look and feel expect for ONE gating question now allows them to use VA.gov instead of saying to go to eBenefits.
- If yes, what: XXX

## Phase II: unmoderated production testing

### Planning:
- Desired date range: June 15 - June 21
- Desired number of unique users: 20-30
- How you'll make the product available in production while limiting the # of users who can find/access it: Using the flipper UI
- "Success" criteria (by the numbers): All of the BDD claims are successful at establishing a new user in MVI. Work with EVSS to make sure the EP codes are being set correctly.

Our plan will be to do 3-4 days of 10% gating, 3-4 days of 50% gating, and 3-4 days of 75% gating before we go full go-live.

### Results:
- Number of unique users: x
- Actual results (per your "success criteria")
- Was the data submitted (if any) easy for VA to process?: yes/no, lorem ipsum
- Types of errors logged: lorem ipsum
- Any UX changes necessary based on the logs, or feedback on user challenges, or VA challenges? yes/no 
- If yes, what: lorem ipsum

More phases? Sure! If it makes sense for your product! Plan them out with the same structure as above.

## Post-launch Questions 

_To be completed once you have gathered your initial set of data, as outlined above._ 

1. How do the KPIs you gathered compare to your pre-launch definition(s) of "success"?
1. What qualitative feedback have you gathered from users or other stakeholders, if any?
1. Which of the assumptions you listed in your product outline were/were not validated? 
1. How might your product evolve now or in the future based on these results?
