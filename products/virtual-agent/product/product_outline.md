# Virtual Agent

## Problem Statement

A well-developed and maintained virtual agent will help users solve problems and complete tasks on their own with little to no human involvement at any time of day. 

An assumption: This can result in decreased time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome, and ultimately decreased call center calls – especially for calls involving simple questions and/or solutions. 

Ultimately, the problem we want to solve with our virtual agent is to help the Veteran self-serve and find information more easily. While we hope that this may also reduce call volumes, the correlation of the availability of a virtual agent as another channel fielding questions and a reduction in call volumes has not yet been proven to exist. Because of the amount of content that is available and needs to be rewritten in conversational format for the chatbot, we want to target starting with smaller targeted content.

The areas we want to address:

1. Giving the Veteran more direct access to the dense content available at va.gov 
2. Providing the Veteran with another channel to interact with the VA that is available all day


## Proposed Solution: (PoV) A Learning Bot

**Proof of Value (PoV): What is the least we can build into a bot that will be valuable to Veterans and allow us to learn more about what users want from a virtual bot?**

The primary goal of this phase is to gather knowledge directly from Veterans (via conversation monitoring, analytics and usability studies) to further finesse the virtual agent’s capabilities moving forward. During this phase, we will build a “Learning Model” virtual agent. Responses will focus primarily on breadth of topics over depth in one area. We understand that the virtual agent cannot answer every possible question Veterans have. To that end, we want to gather feedback on what users want to know the most about so we can continue to train our bot in the right areas.

## Goals for the PoV:

1. Create a conversational tool to help Veterans self-serve through increased awareness of existing website resources. 
2. To learn if/how the Virtual Agent is valuable to the Veteran. This will help us decide the path forward.
3. Understand the effort of managing a virtual agent, including skills, team allocation and content management.

**Phase 1: Training the Dialogue Model**

The conversation models need to be trained via two formats:

- Intents and Entities (what the user wants)
- Responses (what the virtual agent can surface as a response)

For Phase 1 we will look for the following high-topic, and draft high-level (unauthenticated) responses only for the following areas:

- Va.gov Benefits (education, health, etc.)
- Handling Veteran Crisis scenarios (presenting phone number)
- Covid Questions











## Release Plan

Current Launch: July 2021

## Key Decisions

- Using PVA to build and train our bot
- Release in the July timeframe based on GCC
