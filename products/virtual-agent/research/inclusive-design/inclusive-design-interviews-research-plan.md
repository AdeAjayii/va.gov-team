# Research Plan for Virtual Agent Inclusive Design Interviews, 5/18/2021

As a researcher I want to create a research plan so Perigean can recruit the right users for our research study.

## Goals

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

This research is for the VA-Virtual Agent team for the Virtual Agent product. 	

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The virtual agent/chatbot will eventually be hosted on Va.gov. Exact location(s) to be determined. Ultimately, the virtual agent’s goal is to provide responses based on existing Va.gov content. This project is part of the larger Omnichannel strategy (led by VEO) to provide veterans with seamless access to information. 

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

We want to conduct research to answer qualitative feedback about our product which tie into our success metrics for the product, including questions such as:

- What assistive technology do you use and for what tasks?
- What were you trying to do using the chatbot and why?
- Was there anything special about how you used the phrasing/language you used? 
- Did you experience any errors and if so what did you do to correct them, if anything?
- When did you stop interacting with the chatbot and why? At any point were you frustrated, overwhelmed or otherwise felt negative with the bot? 
- Did the chatbot have the appropriate conversational tone?
- Did you feel confident in the bot’s responses?
- Was it easy to understand?
- What’s something you liked about it?
- What’s something that could be improved in the product?
- Based on your experience, would you use this chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not and when?
- Any other feedback?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

The focus is on understanding general usage and mental models rather than validating a specific hypothesis. However, we are curious about the following assumptions: 

- Participants who require assistive technology such as screen readers or rate the experience negatively; we also want to understand what problems occur and how severe they are
- Participants may search for resources related to disability
- Participants may become frustrated or rate the experience negatively when they can’t identify language to make the chatbot ‘work’.

Since we are also conducting a controlled study of the chatbot we will be looking at the hypotheses from that study, including:

- More Veterans will attempt to find information that requires authentication (e.g., claims-status). 
- We will see a high number of questions that the bot has not yet been trained to answer. 
- There is a niche-market for this product. We wonder if:
    - Caretakers (likely more women) may give a higher satisfaction rating, or be more interested in a virtual agent/chatbot. 
    - Veterans who may be seeking anonymity (e.g., LGBTQ+, housing or food insecurity, mental-health crisis) may be more comfortable utilizing this tool over speaking with a human. 
    - Veterans will attempt to sign in order to use the bot for their specific information.
    - Veterans will want the chatbot to transfer their conversation directly to a human agent. 
    - Veterans will expect that the chatbot cannot answer in depth questions. 


## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	

We would like to conduct direct interviews with observation of the product.  While we are aware of some accessibility challenges in the product we’re using to make the chatbot, we would like to observe users with the product directly to understand if we are capturing all the problems and how severe they are.

2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

We want to interview and observe so that we can:

- Identify problems they experience while utilizing assistive technology. 
- Learn in what ways any disability can impact chatbot usage. 
- Understand how participants are using the chatbot - what tasks they’re trying to complete, how they interact with the chatbot and how they correct errors.
- If they try to sign into va.gov prior to engaging with the chatbot. 
- Observe what language they use when engaging with the chatbot. 

3.	Where are you planning to do your research

Online, Perigean's Zoom

4.	What will you be testing?

We will be gathering feedback on the product at staging.va.gov/virtual-agent

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	

Perigean's Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  

1. **Primary criteria / Must have** 

We are looking for 10 Veterans who have experiences with any of the following:

- Auditory disabilities
- Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities - autism, adhd, aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, non-native English speakers, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning (such as learning, problem-solving, judgment, PTSD)
- Physical (i.e. motor) disabilities
- Speech disabilities
- Visual impairment
- PTSD, TBI or MST

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	

Perigean

## When?

1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	

**TO UPDATE**

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	

Yes, the product will be ready at staging.va.gov/virtual-agent.

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

Approximately 45 minutes sessions, with a 30 minute buffer in between.

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.

**TO UPDATE**

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	
A few days before June 1st - Luciana Morais and Katie Ho  **TO UPDATE**
