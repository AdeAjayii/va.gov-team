## The role of research for phase 2


We'll be conducting research to understand Veterans experience and validate our work, and will update this document with our activities

There are two additional sources of work to incorporate for phase 2:

- incorporating findings from the work the BAH team have done as stories.  These are being monitored in the Research Tracker Google doc the Thoughtworkss team is mantaining

- incorporatinig ongoing accessibility considerations, especially WCAG 2.1
