# Research Plan for Virtual Agent, 5/x/2021 - TO UPDATE
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	

## Goals	TO UPDATE

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

This research is for the VA-Virtual Agent team for the Virtual Agent product. 	

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

This product will be hosted on VA.gov as a virtual agent, colloquially known as a chatbot, to assist and answer veteran questions on all topics currently located on VA.gov. It is part of the larger Omnni-Channel strategy to provide veterans easier and self-serving access to their care and benefits.	

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

We want to conduct research to answer qualitative feedback about our product which tie into our success metrics for the product, including questions such as:

- What assistive technology do you use and for what tasks?
- What were you trying to do using the chatbot and why?
- Was there anything special about how you used the phrasing/language you used? 
- Did you experience any errors and if so what did you do to correct them, if anything?
- When did you stop interacting with the chatbot and why? At any point were you frustrated, overwhelmed or otherwise felt negative with the bot? 
- Did the chatbot have the appropriate conversational tone?
- Did you feel confident in the bot’s responses?
- Was it easy to understand?
- What’s something you liked about it?
- What’s something that could be improved in the product?
- Based on your experience, would you use this chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not and when?
- Any other feedback?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

The purpose of our proof of value is to learn what people are asking information about or tasks they want to complete, what language they use, how they interact with the product and how to build the chatbot.  As such, the focus is on understanding general usage and mental models rather than specific hypotheses we are looking for data to validate or refute.  We do want to explore a number of hypotheses, including:

## Method	TO UPDATE
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	

We would like to conduct directed interviews and observation with the product.  While we are aware of some accessibility challenges in the product we’re using to make the chatbot, we would like to observe users with the product directly to understand if we are capturing all the problems and how severe they are.

2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

We want to interview and observe because we want to:

- Understand how participants are using the chatbot - what tasks they’re trying to complete,, how they interact with the chatbot and how they correct errors, if they sign into va.gov, etc. through observation
- Observe what language they use when
- Identify problems they experience and which we need to resolve especially with assistive technology


3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	


4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	


5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	


## Participants and Recruitment	TO UPDATE
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-

1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)	

## When? 	TO UPDATE

1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	


2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	


3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.


4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.


5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	


## Team Roles	TO UPDATE
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
