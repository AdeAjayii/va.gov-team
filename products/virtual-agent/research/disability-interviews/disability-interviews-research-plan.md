# Research Plan for Virtual Agent Disability Interviews, 5/18/2021

As a researcher I want to create a research plan so Perigean can recruit the right users for our research study.

## Goals

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

This research is for the VA-Virtual Agent team for the Virtual Agent product. 	

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The virtual agent/chatbot will eventually be hosted on Va.gov. Exact location(s) to be determined. Ultimately, the virtual agent’s goal is to provide responses based on existing Va.gov content. This project is part of the larger Omnichannel strategy (led by VEO) to provide veterans with seamless access to information. 

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

We want to conduct research to answer qualitative feedback about our product which tie into our success metrics for the product, including questions such as:

- What assistive technology do you use and for what tasks?
- What were you trying to do using the chatbot and why?
- Was there anything special about how you used the phrasing/language you used? 
- Did you experience any errors and if so what did you do to correct them, if anything?
- When did you stop interacting with the chatbot and why? At any point were you frustrated, overwhelmed or otherwise felt negative with the bot? 
- Did the chatbot have the appropriate conversational tone?
- Did you feel confident in the bot’s responses?
- Was it easy to understand?
- What’s something you liked about it?
- What’s something that could be improved in the product?
- Based on your experience, would you use this chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not and when?
- Any other feedback?

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

The focus is on understanding general usage and mental models rather than validating a specific hypothesis. However, we are curious about the following assumptions: 

- Participants who require assistive technology such as screen readers or rate the experience negatively; we also want to understand what problems occur and how severe they are
- Participants may search for resources related to disability
- Participants may become frustrated or rate the experience negatively when they can’t identify language to make the chatbot ‘work’.

Since we are also conducting a controlled study of the chatbot we will be looking at the hypotheses from that study, including:

- More Veterans will attempt to find information that requires authentication (e.g., claims-status). 
- We will see a high number of questions that the bot has not yet been trained to answer. 
- There is a niche-market for this product. We wonder if:
    - Caretakers (likely more women) may give a higher satisfaction rating, or be more interested in a virtual agent/chatbot. 
    - Veterans who may be seeking anonymity (e.g., LGBTQ+, housing or food insecurity, mental-health crisis) may be more comfortable utilizing this tool over speaking with a human. 
    - Veterans will attempt to sign in order to use the bot for their specific information.
    - Veterans will want the chatbot to transfer their conversation directly to a human agent. 
    - Veterans will expect that the chatbot cannot answer in depth questions. 


## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	

We would like to conduct direct interviews with observation of the product.  While we are aware of some accessibility challenges in the product we’re using to make the chatbot, we would like to observe users with the product directly to understand if we are capturing all the problems and how severe they are.

2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

We want to interview and observe so that we can:

- Identify problems they experience while utilizing assistive technology. 
- Learn in what ways any disability can impact chatbot usage. 
- Understand how participants are using the chatbot - what tasks they’re trying to complete, how they interact with the chatbot and how they correct errors.
- If they try to sign into va.gov prior to engaging with the chatbot. 
- Observe what language they use when engaging with the chatbot. 

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	

Online, Perigean's Zoom

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	

We will be gathering feedback on the product at staging.va.gov/virtual-agent

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	

Perigean's Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment	TO UPDATE
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-

1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?







*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)	

## When? 	TO UPDATE

1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	


2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	


3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.


4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.


5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	


## Team Roles	TO UPDATE
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:
