# Conversation Guide Template for Moderated Research

## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Mute your Slack notifications*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute.*

*In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked*

*Check your [screensharing setup] and share permissions for participants.*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Ensure participant has been emailed the correct staging link and fake username/password: https://staging.va.gov/virtual-agent-study/ 


## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Pilar Moreno], and with me are also some colleagues that are observing and taking notes.
We are from a team that is currently building a chatbot for the VA site, and we want to learn more about veterans and their families 
who use Spanish as their main language and how you are currently working with the VA, so we can provide a better service.

To do this we will have a session in two parts, first **I will be asking you some questions about you and your experience with the VA and chatbots**. 
This will be very useful to help us better understand what you need. 
The second part **I will show you a preview of the chatbot and I will ask you to do some tasks**. Here I will need to hear your honest opinion,
we are here to evaluate the chatbot and not you, if you feel stuck for example, it will help us know what we can improve. 

- **This entire session should take about [30-45 min].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototype chatbot.** This prototype chatbot may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a prototype, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. 
- The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions (Optional) - 5 minutes

Before we look at the prototype, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.


 - What kind of information do you usually need from the VA?
 - When you need general VA information, how do you find it?
 - When you need personal information from the VA, how do you find it?
 - In which situations do you look for information in Spanish rather than in English?
 - [If aplicable] What do you do when you can't find this information?
 - [If aplicable] Do you know of other family members of other veterans who depend solely on Spanish information? What information do they usually look for? How?
 - What's has your general experience with chatbots been like?



## First Task: [Screen Share] - 1-2 minutes

- I'd like you to share your screen with me. Can you click on the green share screen button, located at the bottom middle of the Zoom window.
- Please select your desktop window to share so we can be sure to see the web browser you're using.

### Things to watch for:

- Are they able to find the share screen button?

## Second Task: [Open Chatbot URL] - 2-3 minutes

- You should have just received a link to your provided email to access the chatbot. Can you please open it now? 
- Can you take a moment to familiarize yourself with the webpage you just opened?
- Next I'd like you to use the provided username and password from the same email to sign into to the chatbot.
- Take a moment to read the intro text and let me know if it is clear or if there is anything confusing. 
- What do you think this text means? What would you do next?
- --What do you think about the crisis disclaimer?


### Things to watch for:

- Are they able to find the provided link and open it. If not we can dictate the url or in worst case, share our screen and sign in to demo the tool.
- Do they sign in using the button in the chatbot or the regular sign in button on the upper right corner of the webpage?
- Do they read the intro text to the chatbot?
- **Do they struggle with the lack of Spanish in the site? Can they start the conversation?**

## Third Task: [Ask General Question] - 5 minutes

- Now that you have read the intro text, I'd like you to ask the chatbot a general question about benefits **in Spanish(?)**.
- Next copy and paste which response you would like to view for a link, preview or full chatbot response.
- Please take a moment to read the chatbot response and click any links that may be relevant to your question. What do you think about the info provided? Is it helpful? Why or why not? If not, what would you expect to see as a response instead?
- [If they can't understand the content] What would you do next to try to find this information? What action would you take?
- Please copy/paste the next view you want to read
- And lastly please copy/paste the remaining view to read the response.

### Things to watch for:

- Which view do they choose and in what order?
- Do they automatically click provided links in the response?
- Do they find their answers?

## Fourth Task: [Ask about Claims] - 5 minutes

- Ok, now I'd like you to ask the chatbot about the status of your fake users disability claim.
- Please take a moment to read the chatbot response. What do you think about the info provided? Is it helpful? Why or why not? If not, what would you expect to see as a response instead?
- What step would you take next based on the buttons provided in the chat window? Why would you choose that button?

### Things to watch for:

- Does the participant click the Speak with agent button? What do they think of the response after they click it?
- Does the participant understand the answer from the structure?
- Can they ask the right question?

## Post-Task Interview - 5-10 minutes

- When the bot tells you it does not have the answer, how does it make you feel?
- [If aplicable] How do you feel about the voice and tone of the response you received?
- If the chatbot couldn't answer your question but could connect you to a live agent chat, would you prefer that over speaking by phone with the VA help desk/contact center?
- Was it clear what all the buttons did (button labels) or where all the links went? Would you rephrase any of the buttons?
- Based on your experience today, are you willing to use the chatbot again?
- What additional feature to the chatbot would improve your experience?
- Do you have any other feedback you'd like to share?
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on this virtual agent chatbot and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
