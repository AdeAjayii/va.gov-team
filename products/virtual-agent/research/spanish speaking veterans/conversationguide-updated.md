## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [Pilar Moreno], and with me are also some colleagues that are observing and taking notes. 
We are from a team that is currently building a chatbot for the VA site, and we want to learn more about veterans and their families who use Spanish as their main language and how you are currently working with the VA, so we can provide a better service.
 
We are looking to understand more about what information you need, how you currently interact and find this information with the VA and how would you like to, so we can think if there is some way that we can support through the chatbot or other mediums.
During the session I will be asking you some questions about you, your experience with the VA and chatbots. This will be very useful to help us better understand what you need. The second part I will show you a preview of the chatbot and I will ask you how would you use it, here we’d appreciate your honest opinion as it will make us better understand. Here we will not be testing you or your abilities, we will be testing our chatbot and where are its limits and how can we make it work for you.

-This entire session should take about [30-45 min]. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
-If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.
-Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today? We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately.
-The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly, as it will be keep it anonymous.
If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.

*Start recording.*

I have started recording. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?
