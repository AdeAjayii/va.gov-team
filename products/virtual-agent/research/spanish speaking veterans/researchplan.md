# Research Plan for [Orchid, Virtual Agent, January 2021]

## Background
We are releasing an unauthenticated chatbot in Feb 2022 that will act as a new way to access information to the veterans, and an authenticated version in April 2022, that will provide personalization and features to access private information, such as claims and appeals status. 

Our goal is to understand the needs of Spanish speaking veterans and beneficiaries regarding trying to access information in the VA, how the needs for a chatbot differ for this group, and if there are any specific needs for this group.

### OCTO Objectives 

Decrease the time Veterans spend waiting for an outcome.
Increase the quality and reliability of VA services.

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?

This product's goal is to support the veteran to find and access information to be able to not only navigate one stage but also the transition between them, and to help the veteran move among the journey.

## Research Goals	
What are you trying to learn from this research? 
- How do needs from Spanish speaking veterans differ from the English speaking veterans regarding self service through the chatbot.
- How do Spanish speaking veterans interact with a chatbot.

### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?
- With the learning we will be able to assess what this group needs and we would be able to evaluate what we can offer from our solution.


### Research questions
Main question: How do the needs for a chatbot differ for the Spanish speaking veterans?

#Profile:

Who needs content in Spanish (veterans, beneficiaries, dependents, caregivers)?
Do they use Spanish as a preferred language?

#Needs:

- What information are they looking for?
- What tasks are they trying to complete?
- In which situations do they look for content in Spanish or a different language than English
- Is there a language barrier? Are there enough resources in Spanish at the VA?
- What do they do when they cannot find the information they need in Spanish? 

#Chatbot / Technology:

- How would they interact with the chatbot? Translation?
- How would they expect to interact via mobile? (SMS, App based)?
- How do they currently interact through the VA?
- Would they use the chatbot in Spanish?


### Hypothesis
Spanish speaking veterans, especially family members and caregivers would prefer a chatbot as a way of interacting with the VA, rather than via telephone.

Spanish speaking veterans will have similar information needs than the English speaking ones: ex: Facilities, Claims and Appeals. Nevertheless, there can be expected challenges to access this information, as well as independent topics related to language related topics.


## Method	
Direct interview with moderated usability testing.
- This method would be able to explore where the needs match and differ between English and Spanish speaking veterans, moderated would allow us to dive deeper into certain topics by asking follow-up questions to the interview or tasks we ask them to complete



### Location
Remote, using Perigean Zoom.

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	

### Recruitment approach
6 Veterans caretakers or family members who are primarly Spanish spekaing and limited or non-English speaking.


### Recruitment criteria
3 veterans
3 caretakers / family members

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**

- Do you speak Spanish as your preferred language? (Answer should be yes)
- Have you interacted or need information from the VA in the last 2 years? (Website, calling) (Answer should be yes)
- Do you consider your English limited or don't speak English? (Answer should be yes) #Added this one to exclude veterans that have fluent in English.


**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
- Are you a family member or caretaker? (Would be interesting to get this perspective, as they are not required to a level of English language proficiency)
- Have you used chatbots before?

## Timeline
24 - 28 of January 2021

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)
