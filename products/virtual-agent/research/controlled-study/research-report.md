   * x Veterans
   * x Veteran family or caregivers
* Gender: 
   *  women
   *  men
* Geographically diverse: 
   *  
* Age range

   *  participants 35 - 44
   *  participants 45 - 54
   *  participant 55-65
   *  participant over 65

## Key Findings

1. Conversation with the VA
[a]
* Vets, care-takers and family members want communication between the VA and them to be personable, curious and empathetic.

> [When] in person, they can see I'm a female, generally get a more soft response. It’s not always what I want--sometimes soothing, sometimes demeaning. In emails it doesn’t really matter, but I want to be addressed right.  Automatically makes me angry they couldn’t take the 3 seconds. They’re obviously not looking at the rest of my chart.

2. Current use of VA channels

## Details of Findings

## Additional Insights

**Future research areas:**

TBD
* What is the drop off point until people lose patience and move to another channel
* Outreach to a generation that believes in ‘people first’ channel
* Metrics for desktop vs. mobile interaction rates
* If they are ‘signed in’ will the conversation carry over if they switch devices?
Results of Hypotheses
Veterans, caretakers and family members prefer service-driven conversational tone with accurate responses that will build trust in the product, especially since they know that they will not be interacting with an actual human. Providing a name for the chatbot should remain generic (i.e., VA Chatbot, Virtual Agent, etc) and only establish context for what it is, what it can do, and how it fits into the other products and services the VA provides. This will personalize the experience for some while maintaining its true ‘bot’ nature for all. 


## Next Steps

* TBD
