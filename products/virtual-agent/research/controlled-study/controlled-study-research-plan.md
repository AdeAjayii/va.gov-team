# Research Plan for Virtual Agent, 5/x/2021  TO UPDATE
As a researcher I want to create a research plan so Perigean can recruit the right users for our research study.	

## Goals

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

This research is for the VA-Virtual Agent team for the Virtual Agent product. 	

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

This product will be hosted on VA.gov as a virtual agent, colloquially known as a chatbot, to assist and answer veteran questions on all topics currently located on VA.gov. It is part of the larger Omnichannel strategy to provide veterans easier and self-serving access to their care and benefits.	

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

We want to conduct research to answer qualitative feedback about our product which tie into our success metrics for the product, including questions such as:

- What were you trying to do using the chatbot and why?
- Was there anything special about how you used the phrasing/language you used? 
- Did you experience any errors and if so what did you do to correct them, if anything?
- When did you stop interacting with the chatbot and why? At any point were you frustrated, overwhelmed or otherwise felt negative with the bot? 
- Did the chatbot have the appropriate conversational tone?
- Did you feel confident in the bot’s responses?
- Was it easy to understand?
- What’s something you liked about it?
- What’s something that could be improved in the product?
- Based on your experience, would you use this chatbot again to help answer questions or accomplish a task? Why or why not and when?
- Any other feedback?


4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

The purpose of our proof of value is to learn what people are asking information about or tasks they want to complete, what language they use, how they interact with the product and how to build the chatbot.  As such, the focus is on understanding general usage and mental models rather than specific hypotheses we are looking for data to validate or refute. 


## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	

Remote unmoderated

We would like to conduct an unmoderated controlled study where participants are invited to participate in the study by email and are sent a link to the chatbot on Staging.va.gov, a feedback link as well as a validation code.  

After using the application, participants click on the link to capture feedback (likely on Optimal Workshop) and then enter in a validation code (likely on Optimal Workshop) so we can track who has participated and so participants can be compensated.  

2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

We want to use this unmoderated method because we want to:

- Observe how participants are using the chatbot - what tasks they’re trying to complete,, how they interact with the chatbot and how they correct errors, if they sign into va.gov, etc. 
- Observe what language they use when
- Identify problems they experience and which we need to resolve

We want to conduct interviews with a small portion of the group to also ask questions about the experience to capture feedback - this will be in another study.

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	

Online

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	

We will be gathering feedback on the product at staging.va.gov/virtual-agent

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	

We plan to use Optimal Workshop to capture feedback

## Participants and Recruitment	TO UPDATE
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  
(Mention: Number of people, ages, accessibility preferences, geographical diversity, login requirements, VA benefit requirements, familiarity with technology, etc. Keep in mind, the more requirements, the more difficult the recruit, so give ample time to ensure the right participant mix.)	

Please list your participant criteria in two categories-

1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 


TBD


2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

n/a

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	

- Perigean

## When?

**1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?** 	

We would like to conduct research June 1st for approximately one week, until June 8th,

**2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)**

Yes, the product will be ready at staging.va.gov/virtual-agent 

**3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.**

There is no set length of session as users will click on a link and we will be monitoring their interactions and duration of use.

**4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?**

June 1st to June 8th.  As this is unmoderated, we won’t require scheduling of sessions (to confirm)
