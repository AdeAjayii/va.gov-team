# Research Plan for Virtual Agent, 5/17/2021
As a researcher I want to create a research plan so Perigean can recruit the right users for our research study.	

## Goals

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

This research is for the VA-Virtual Agent team for the Virtual Agent product. 	

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The virtual agent/chatbot will eventually be hosted on Va.gov. Exact location(s) to be determined. Ultimately, the virtual agent’s goal is to provide responses based on existing Va.gov content. This project is part of the larger Omnichannel strategy (led by VEO) to provide veterans with seamless access to information. 

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

We hope to gather the following qualitative insights: 

- Was the chatbot able to answer their question?
- Did the chatbot’s response correctly match the Veteran’s intent? 
- How did they feel when the chatbot was unable to answer their question? 
- Do they expect the chatbot to answer authenticated (e.g., personalized) questions or unauthenticated (high-level) questions?
- Was the response sufficient enough for the Veteran to take immediate action toward completing their task? 
- How did they feel about the voice, tone, and quality of the response they received? 
- Did the chatbot feel trustworthy? 
- How often are Veterans willing to re-engage with the chatbot after an initial interaction? 
- What kind of language (e.g., terminology, sentiment, length of phrasing) did Veterans commonly use to engage with the chatbot? 
- Did they try to speak to a human agent? 
- Was there anything confusing or frustrating to them? 
- What sort of features and capabilities are they looking for in a chatbot? 
- Can they see themselves using this tool, or do they think it’s a better fit for someone else? 

4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

The focus of this study is to understand general usage and mental models rather than validate a specific hypothesis. However, we are exploring the following assumptions:

- More Veterans will attempt to find information that requires authentication (e.g., claims-status). 
- We will see a high number of questions that the bot has not yet been trained to answer. 
- There is a niche-market for this product. We wonder if:
    -  Caretakers (likely more women) may give a higher satisfaction rating, or be more interested in a virtual agent/chatbot. 
    -  Veterans who may be seeking anonymity (e.g., LGBTQ+, housing or food insecurity, mental-health crisis) may be more comfortable   utilizing this tool over speaking with a human. 
- Veterans will attempt to sign in order to use the bot for their specific information.
- Veterans will want the chatbot to transfer their conversation directly to a human agent. 
- Veterans will expect that the chatbot cannot answer in depth questions. 


## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	

Remote unmoderated

We would like to conduct an unmoderated controlled study where participants are invited to participate in the study by email and are sent a link to the chatbot on Staging.va.gov, a feedback link as well as a validation code.  

After using the application, participants click on the link to capture feedback (likely on Optimal Workshop) and then enter in a validation code (likely on Optimal Workshop) so we can track who has participated and so participants can be compensated.  

We have some additional instructions to add to the screener you send out with participants.  We’re revising that text, which will essentially walk them through the process and talk about the importance of feedback, that they should spend at least 10 minutes using it etc.  While recruiting can start, we hope to have that email finished to send out to confirmed participants.

2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

An unmoderated study prevents bias. We need Veterans to engage with the virtual agent in as close to a realistic setting as possible, so that we can learn how they actually interact with a virtual agent when no one is providing support or guiding their thoughts. 

However, we have a small sample-size moderated study with disabled Veterans in the works. Details for that study will be provided in that study’s research plan. 

3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	

Strictly Online

4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	

We will be gathering feedback on the product at staging.va.gov/virtual-agent

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	

We plan to use Optimal Workshop to capture feedback.

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  

1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

We require 100 participants, with 10 participants in each pods or segment:

Veterans:

Segment #1: 10 participants who are female Veterans
- For this demographic, aim for an equal number of participants across age brackets and conflicts/periods of service - so Korean Conflict, Vietnam Era, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq.

Segment #2: 10 participants who are Male Veterans
- For this demographic, aim for an equal number of participants across age brackets and conflicts/periods of service - so Korean Conflict, Vietnam Era, Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, Iraq.

Non-Veterans:

Segment #3: 10 participants who are people close to Veterans
- Can be female caretakers, male caretaker or family members (i.e. dependents)

Usage related segments:

- Segment #4: 10 participants who are new to va.gov (2 years or less) 

- Segment #5: 10 participants who are casual, infrequent users of va.gov (once a year)

- Segment #6: 10 participants who are frequent users (i.e. dependent on claims etc. or who visit va.gov daily or weekly)

Location:

- Segment #7: 10 participants who live in urban centers

- Segment #8: 10 participants who live in suburban or rural areas

Marginalized populations:

- Segment #9: 10 participants who identify as LGBTQ+ 

- Segment #10: 10 participants who are experiencing economic insecurity - (i.e. experiencing homelessness/housing insecure, food insecurity, either currently or previously in their time as a Veteran post-discharge from service).


For technology requirements:

- Login: no login requirements.  
- Device: Has used computers and Internet; we will be having users test on their desktop/laptop where possible


2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

n/a

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	

- Perigean

## When?

**1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research?** 	

We would like to start the research on June 1st and run it until 100 participants are met. 

**2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)**

Yes, the product will be ready at staging.va.gov/virtual-agent. 

**3. Length of Sessions**

There is no set length of session. However, we would prefer if participants spend at least 10 minutes trying the virtual agent.

**4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled?**

To start on June 1st and to end when reliable data for 100 participants is met. 

**5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?**
