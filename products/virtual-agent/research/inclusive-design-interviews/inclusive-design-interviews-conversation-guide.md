## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to ask you some questions about chatbots, your experience with them in general, and what you might expect from one from the VA. 

The VA acknowledges that a large percentage of Veterans live with a disability or conditions like PTSD, so it’s important for us to understand your experiences as we work with you to design better products.  So we’re here today to ensure that the products we’re working on will help Veterans like yourself and be as accessible as possible.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about 45 min.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this interview, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability to use technology or chatbots. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the interview, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*  - **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Questions







## Thank-You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to design a VA chatbot and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
