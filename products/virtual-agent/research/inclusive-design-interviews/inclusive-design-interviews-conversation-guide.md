## Intro

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to ask you some questions about chatbots, your experience with them in general, and what you might expect from one from the VA. 

The VA acknowledges that a large percentage of Veterans live with a disability or conditions like PTSD, so it’s important for us to understand your experiences as we work with you to design better products.  So we’re here today to ensure that the products we’re working on will help Veterans like yourself and be as accessible as possible.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- This entire session should take about 30 minutes. I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- In this interview, we want to hear your honest opinions about how you interact with va.gov and its products to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the interview, please let me know.
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*  - **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?

    - Non-VA staff - family member, other Veterans…?

## Product demo

TBD - Now we want to show you the chatbot.  We’re putting an address in the chat and we’d like you to go to that page. https://staging.va.gov/virtual-agent-study/. Facilitator go through disclaimer and read pertinent parts.

TBD.  If you normally use assistive technology to access the Web, please feel free to use it - we encourage it. If the assistive technology encounters any problems, we’ll note it.

(These questions below are consistent with the controlled study list)

-Did the chatbot answer your questions accurately? 

-Did the chatbot understand what you were trying to ask 

- After reading the response, did you have the information you needed to take the next step to complete your task?

- If the chatbot wasn’t able to answer your question, how did that make you feel?

- The chatbot can answer both general questions (for example, location of a VA facility) and personal questions (your benefit status). However, you must sign into va.gov for the chatbot to answer personal questions. How do you prefer to use this chatbot? 

- How do you feel about the voice of the response you received? Voice refers to the personality of the chatbot (friendly, chatty, dry, etc.)

- How do you feel about the tone of the response you received? Tone refers to the style of response (professional, bureaucratic, casual, etc.) 

- How do you feel about the quality of the response you received? Quality refers to your satisfaction with the accuracy of responses. Were you given the right link? Was your question answered? 

- Based on your experience today, are you willing to use the chatbot again?

- Do you have any other feedback you'd like to share?


## Thank-You and Closing

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to design a VA chatbot and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
