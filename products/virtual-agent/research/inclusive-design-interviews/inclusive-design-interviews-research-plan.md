# Research Plan for Virtual Agent Inclusive Design Interviews, 6/x/2021

As a researcher I want to create a research plan so Perigean can recruit the right users for our research study.

## Goals

1. What product & team are you doing this research for?	

This research is for the VA-Virtual Agent team for the Virtual Agent product. 	

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product? 	

The virtual agent/chatbot will eventually be hosted on Va.gov. Exact location(s) to be determined. Ultimately, the virtual agent’s goal is to provide responses based on existing Va.gov content. This project is part of the larger Omnichannel strategy (led by VEO) to provide veterans with seamless access to information. 

3. Research questions: What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research? 	

A large percentage of Veterans live with a disability, including auditory disabilities, cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities, PTSD, physical disabilities, speech disabilities and visual impairment.  We also know there are accessiblity challenges with chatbots as well as with the current chatbot built on Power Virtual Agent. We want to conduct research to understand the use of chatbots by Veterans and capture qualitative feedback about our product, including:

- What assistive technology do Veterans use and for what tasks for va.gov
- How Veterans normally contact the VA and how often and why
- Do Veterans sign into va.gov - why or why not
- How Veterans normally find information on va.gov
- How often Veterans speak with a VA help desk/contact center
- Have Veterans ever used a chatbot or virtual agent online
- Have Veterans used the coronavirus chatbot on VA.gov
- Did the chatbot we created answer questions accurately
- Did the chatbot we created understand what participant were trying to ask
- Did participants have the information needed to take the next step to complete the tas
- If the chatbot wasn’t able to answer questions, how did that make participants feel
- How do participants feel about the voice, tone, quality of the responses
- Can a chatbot help reduce how often they contact the VA
- Would participants be willing to use the chatbot again


4. Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research? 	

The focus is on understanding general usage and mental models rather than validating a specific hypothesis. However, we are curious about the following assumptions: 

- Participants who require assistive technology such as screen readers or rate the experience negatively; we also want to understand what problems occur and how severe they are
- Participants may search for resources related to disability
- Participants may become frustrated or rate the experience negatively when they can’t identify language to make the chatbot ‘work’.

Since we are also conducting a controlled study of the chatbot we will be looking at the hypotheses from that study, including:

- More Veterans will attempt to find information that requires authentication (e.g., claims-status). 
- We will see a high number of questions that the bot has not yet been trained to answer. 
- There is a niche-market for this product. We wonder if:
    - Caretakers (likely more women) may give a higher satisfaction rating, or be more interested in a virtual agent/chatbot. 
    - Veterans who may be seeking anonymity (e.g., LGBTQ+, housing or food insecurity, mental-health crisis) may be more comfortable utilizing this tool over speaking with a human. 
    - Veterans will attempt to sign in order to use the bot for their specific information.
    - Veterans will want the chatbot to transfer their conversation directly to a human agent. 
    - Veterans will expect that the chatbot cannot answer in depth questions. 

## Method
1.	What method of research are you planning? 	

We would like to conduct direct interviews with observation of the product.  

We are aware of some of the accessibility challenges in the product but would like to observe users with the product directly to understand more about these problems how severe they are and also gain feedback on the product itself.

2.	Why this method? How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	

We want to interview and observe so that we can:

- Identify problems they experience while utilizing assistive technology. 
- Learn in what ways any disability can impact chatbot usage. 
- Understand how participants are using the chatbot - what tasks they’re trying to complete, how they interact with the chatbot and how they correct errors.
- If they try to sign into va.gov prior to engaging with the chatbot. 
- Observe what language they use when engaging with the chatbot. 

3.	Where are you planning to do your research

Online, Perigean's Zoom

4.	What will you be testing?

We will be gathering feedback on the product at staging.va.gov/virtual-agent

5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	

Perigean's Zoom

## Participants and Recruitment
1.	Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?	  

1. **Primary criteria / Must have** 

We are looking for 10 Veterans who have experiences with any of the following:

- Auditory disabilities
- Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities - autism, adhd, aphasia, dyslexia, dyscalculia, distractibility, memory loss, reading difficulties, non-native English speakers, low tolerance for cognitive overload, and intellectual/adaptive functioning (such as learning, problem-solving, judgment)
- Physical (i.e. motor) disabilities
- Speech disabilities
- Visual impairment
- PTSD, TBI or MST

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	

Perigean

## When?

1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	

**TO UPDATE**

2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	

Yes, the product will be ready at staging.va.gov/virtual-agent-study.

3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

Approximately 30 minutes sessions, with a 30 minute buffer in between.

4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.

**TO UPDATE**

5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with?
