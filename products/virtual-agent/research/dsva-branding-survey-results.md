## Survey Results

1) Do you have any hesitations or concerns about giving the virtual agent a name? If any, please share.

    20 out of 39 respondents have no issues with naming the virtual agent.

    - None, as long as it is clearly identified as a virtual entity
    - No - but don’t make it Clippy

    Additional comments for this question include:

    - Needs to represent military culture
    - Ensure name selection builds on creating inclusive environments
    - Yes, due to the tendency for the names not to have diversity and inclusion
    - We aim for conversational, but not casual or overly friendly. A name for a non-human bot feels a bit like the latter. We try very hard (and push our stakeholders very hard) not to brand things. We focus on having one VA.gov voice. I wonder how introducing an "I" rather than our standard "We" would impact that.
    - I do worry that it could be hard to find a name that is innocuous and inclusive.
    - Yes, I'm concerned about naming our virtual agent because the bot will be thought of as the voice of VA through Sandy or Pat or whatever androgynous name we decide on. That feels wrong for a few reasons: 1/ There isn't a human on the other end. And I think we'll form the impression that we're trying to make it seem more personable--when we're really just anthropomorphizing a tool. Feels like we're trying too hard to be friendly or personable when all Veterans want is to get help, get the information or benefits they need. I'd rather have one Veteran say to another: "Hey, I got some good help from VA today" rather than joking about the name of the VA chatbot. 2/  VA is huge. If we give the virtual agent a name, it kind of brings this huge entity down to fit on the head of a pin. That feels weird. 3/ We try really hard to stay away from branding programs, etc. because it's one more thing for Veterans to have to learn about--another name for something. So if we're going to name the virtual agent, we'll want to make sure naming it services some specific purpose for Veterans. That it helps them in some way. In other words, are we naming the chatbot for Veterans' sake or for our sake?
    - Seems like pretending a bot is human is…unnecessary
    - Giving the virtual agent a female name reinforces gender stereotypes. Women who are veterans have had to face a lot of adversity and this would only further it.
    - I would be concerned that individuals will believe it is an actual person.
    - Yes. Names are inevitably gendered and often signal cultural or racial identity. Naming the bot will make it hard to be inclusive. Also, there are already a few "named" apps at VA (e.g., the "Annie" app), and they have been extremely time consuming and expensive to "brand." Veterans can't tell from the name what it's for or what it does, so an inordinate amount of effort must be taken outside of the app experience to explain and educate people what it does.
    - 1) Gender/Cultural identity 2) Risk of putting a name to a "uncontrollable" outcome. Veterans may not have issues with the digital UX, but can be disappointed with a particular decision e.g. wait times that is more systemic than product-based.
    - I do: I think a name is -- for our diverse population -- possibly (now more than ever) fraught due to cultural, gender sensitivities.  But, that's an assumption that should be tested.
    - The name/avatar of the bot should be gender-neutral to avoid implicit bias.
    - A name could cause confusion that it is an actual person the Veteran is chatting with and not clearly identify it as a bot.
    - My concern — Will Veterans think this is a real person?


2) Do you see any advantages to giving the virtual agent a name? If any, please share.

    4 out of 39 respondents saw no advantages to naming the virtual agent.

    - Not really - if the Veteran knows it is a “bot” then I don’t think it matters.

    Additional comments for this question include:

    - It personalizes it for the customer and makes it seem more human.
    - The name will prevent others from naming it unofficially. It will give it a “personality” of sorts.
    - I think a name makes it more personal
    - If implemented correctly, and that it operates as it was intended or designed, the [Virtual] Agent name would likely be shared throughout the Veteran community as a resource worth using.
    - Makes the virtual agent seem more human
    - Yes, more personable.
    - Yes, it feels less impersonal
    - Makes it more personal
    - Potentially personalizes the interaction. In addition I personally like the chatbots that inflect a bit of humor
    - Feels like cold
    - Branding and communication to the veteran population not unlike Siri or Alexa
    - Personalizes the chatbot
    - Only if given a neutral name
    - Yes if the names are diverse. For example I would not use the name Karen
    - Yes. It makes it more personable and staff should be able to identify, associate, remember, and use the platform much better.
    - Yes, it makes the experience seem more personalized. It also can serve as branding. So, if the virtual agent is always named Emily then the customer will learn quickly what Emily can do and when to seek different assistance.
    - Names may make it feel less impersonal
    - Personalizing it
    - If there’s research that shows this will help Veterans in some way, that’s the only reason we should be considering this.
    - A name can make people feel like they’re interacting with a human, rather than a bureaucracy. Alexa, Siri, Erica (Bank of America) humanize big corporations for my everyday interactions with them.
    - It will humanize the bot which will possibly lead to more anger when the bot gives computer generated answers.
    - I think it would be nice to have a friendly name that…[unfinished]
    - The name will relate to what chatbot will do for the users.
    - Yes, I’d like it to be backed by research, but it seems like giving it a name like Siri, makes it feel more personal.
    - 1) An easy short-hand for internal/external folks. 2) There are other chatbots so this might narrow it down (although proliferation might be a risk generally)
    - Only possible advantage is "friendly advocate" potential -- but virtually every user will know it is a bot -- so VA's authenticity will be questioned.
    - Makes the bot seem more personable than just being named "VetBot", "Botty", etc... It could also affect how users feel about giving information to the bot.
    - It might make the experience feel more human, but I do think there is a risk people will think this is an actual human and get even more frustrated if this experience doesn't get them the help they need.
    - Yes, it presents the idea of interacting with a human being.
