# Research Plan for Auth-Flow[Orchid, Virtual Agent, Mar.2021]
#### Shane Strassberg & Pilar Moreno


### Goals
What product & team are you doing this research for?
- This is for the Virtual Agent Chatbot, team Orchid.


- Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?


1. We are releasing an unauthenticated chatbot in Feb 2022 that will act as a new way to access information to the veterans, and an authenticated version in April 2022, that will provide personalization and features to access private information, such as claims and appeals status. 
2. We need to test the flow from non authenticated to authentication, as well as gathering feedback from the current live version.
 
## Research questions: 
#### What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?
1. Non authenticated to authenticated:
- Is the in-chat bot authentication process clear? 
- Would they need to have context retention or without it is enough?
- Do users want/need to sign out from the chatbot?
- Do users need a visual indication for having signed in?
 
2. Current live version:
- Are users able to easily find the Virtual Agent?
- What do users currently understand what the chatbot can do?
 
## Hypothesis: What is your hypothesis for this research?

#### Flow from non-authenticated to authenticated
-Sign in message
-No authentication
-Context retention
-No context retention
-Visual feedback for ‘this chat is secure’

#### Flow from not authenticated to non-authenticated

 b. User asks authenticated question
 can they authenticate? Is it clear?
 Is the feedback after authentication enough? (Lock and personalized greeting version)

 Is it clear how to opt out? Can they still knkow how to know the conversation?
