#### Research Plan for Auth-Flow[Orchid, Virtual Agent, Mar.2021]
#Shane Strassberg & Pilar Moreno
###Goals
What product & team are you doing this research for?
- This is for the Virtual Agent Chatbot, team Orchid.
- Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?
1. We are releasing an unauthenticated chatbot in Feb 2022 that will act as a new way to access information to the veterans, and an authenticated version in April 2022, that will provide personalization and features to access private information, such as claims and appeals status. 
2. We need to test the flow from non authenticated to authentication, as well as gathering feedback from the current live version.
 
###Research questions: 
##What question(s) do you hope to be able to answer after completing this research?
1. Non authenticated to authenticated:
- Is the in-chat bot authentication process clear? 
- Would they need to have context retention or without it is enough?
- Do users want/need to sign out from the chatbot?
- Do users need a visual indication for having signed in?
 
2. Current live version:
- Are users able to easily find the Virtual Agent?
- What do users currently understand what the chatbot can do?

Participants and Recruitment
Participant criteria: What are you looking for in a participant?


6 people
Have used chatbots before
Have a laptop available for testing
Secondary criteria:
3 from rural location
Ethnical / 
Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
Primary criteria / Must have - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.)
Secondary criteria / Would like to have - what other criteria would strengthen your results?
Pro tips for writing recruiting criteria:
If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc.
 
What is your recruitment strategy? 
The plan would be to draw from Perigean.
