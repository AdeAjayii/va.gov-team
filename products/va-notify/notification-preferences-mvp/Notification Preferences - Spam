## Notification Preferences - Informing users they are on the black list and removing them from it


# Context:

Users can mark emails from VANotify as "spam" and when they do they will no longer receive any emails from that VA email domain. This causes an issue as users
will be able to log in and set their preference to "TRUE" on VA.gov but because they are on the black list, they will still not receive emails despite opting in. 
The only way a user can receive emails again is if they knowingly request to be removed from the black list. 



# Key Question:

Do, and if so how do we surface when a user has marked emails from VANotify as spam and will no longer receive emails from the VA unless they request to remove from the blacklist â€“ in the VA.gov Preferences experience? 
 

# Current State: 

Users receive emails from VANotify, some may mark these emails as spam (current spam rate is .05%) and then there is no way to remove them from the black list.

# Proposed Future State

A user who is on the black list opts into receive emails on VA.gov via preferences. They are informed that in order to receive emails they need to request to be removed from the black list.
