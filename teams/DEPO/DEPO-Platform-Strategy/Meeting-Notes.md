# CMS

## Questions

I don't see any OKRs around around ensuring the quality of content produced via the CMS. Is that a part of the mission? (That necessary friction for editors that we've discussed in the past?)


Does the vision for the evolution of the CMS product include modularizing content so the same source content can be served up in multiple locations? (mobile, FAQs, chatbots, etc)

If you look at the proposed DEPO Platform mission, how do you think the CMS does/doesn't align? What parts of the proposed mission feel off given the mission of the CMS product?

What is LC?

Who does CMS define as a "user"? Do you use the word "customer" for anything?

How might we create a streamlined process between a single source of truth for a design component and changes or additions brought about by content model changes in that component?
- In Q1 could we look at a content model change that resulted in a design change?
- 

Collab cycle: how do we treat that for unauth teams?
- Collab cycle (for PW eg) makes them caught in a position of doing collab cycle w/2 different teams. One for CMS and one for code, design, etc. Need content model updated, transformer updated. If we want CMS and VSP closer, need collab cycle for unauth teams to have steps for CMS needs.
- Platform owns the relationship of teams trying to build things on VA.gov, and CMS team is almost in the way sometimes of Jen shipping something.
- Kev Walsh + Kev Hoff have mapped out collab cycle and slot in where CMS might fit in, also KH has segmentation research


How can we better coordinate? It shouldn't be up to eng on the 2 teams to determine priorities

## Action items
- [ ] Get that mapp from KW and KH to the Collab Cycle team, and schedule follow up meeting about CMS collab cycle steps we want to try out
