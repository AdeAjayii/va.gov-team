# CMS

Questions
- I don't see any OKRs around around ensuring the quality of content produced via the CMS. Is that a part of the mission? (That necessary friction for editors that we've discussed in the past?)
- Does the vision for the evolution of the CMS product include modularizing content so the same source content can be served up in multiple locations? (mobile, FAQs, chatbots, etc)
