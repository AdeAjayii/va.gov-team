# CMS

Questions
- I don't see any OKRs around around ensuring the quality of content produced via the CMS. Is that a part of the mission? (That necessary friction for editors that we've discussed in the past?)
- Does the vision for the evolution of the CMS product include modularizing content so the same source content can be served up in multiple locations? (mobile, FAQs, chatbots, etc)
- If you look at the proposed DEPO Platform mission, how do you think the CMS does/doesn't align? What parts of the proposed mission feel off given the mission of the CMS product?
- What is LC?
- Who does CMS define as a "user"? Do you use the word "customer" for anything?
- How might we create a streamlined process between a single source of truth for a design component and changes or additions brought about by content model changes in that component?
