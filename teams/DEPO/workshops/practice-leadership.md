# Practice leadership workshop brief

The purpose of this workshop is not to devise a solution to this problem, but rather to identify gaps and where OCTO-DE needs to put together strategy/vision to solve.

## Problem space brief

5/6/2021

We have a handful of highly skilled individuals on the OCTO-DE side who are experts in a given field (notably content, accessibility, IA, and design) and whom we look to as the protectors of those practices on VA.gov. The term "practice lead" came about organically, grassroots-style, as a way to describe and wrap heads around these people and their role here, however there was never an intentional OCTO-DE creation of this role nor a conscious accepting of this role by these individuals. There's never been any explicit definition of what it means to have this role - what the expectations and responsibilities are, what the needs are for success, and really whether it's indeed these peoples' role at all. All of this results in mismatched understandings of what practice leads and Collab Cycle members or VFS Teams or VA.gov members at large expect of each other, and has been the source of much confusion and frustration.


### Examples:

**Practice lead pain:**
- Practice leads are being put in an arbitration position: a VFS team builds a thing that doesn't meet our standards, and we look to the practice leads to be the enforcers. But these individuals don't have the bandwidth, or in some cases the desire, to play that role.
- Due to the squishy responsibilities and potentially some overlap between practice leads and collab cycle team member, practice leads at times have been asked to provide reviews of VFS work, and they have to guide VFS folks to go through the collab cycle and thus get their reviews through the Collab Cycle team member instead.
- Taking on unexpected implementation work (like Chatbot)
- 

**Collab cycle member pain:**
- Collab Cycle members are at times expected to fulfill responsibilities that are out of scope. For a recent example (though this pain point is not limited to the content space), the chatbot team had been working with content practice area leads to get input on their content, but when the practice leads' bandwidth got too tight, they sought Peggy's help with content strategy and creation instead. It's taxing to have to either pick up that extra work because they want to be helpful, or alternatively explain that essentially there's no one to help and the team's out of luck.
- Collab cycle members at times spend time and energy providing reviews of VFS work, when unbeknownst to them the practice lead has either already given a separate OK, or is still working with the VFS team on their strategy - this leads to wasted collab cycle member efforts and they have limited bandwidth already so can be pretty frustrating. One recent example (though again this pain point is not limited to the content spce): practice leads were working on content strategy for Claims/Appeals NOD, but the VFS team continued with their Collab Cycle process and got a content review before the practice leads had wrapped up their part. Again, the squishiness around what VFS teams should expect of practice leads vs collab cycle members and how those expectations intersect led in this case to Peggy spending time and energey crafting feedback that will likely need to be redone.

**VFS team pain**
- Have to rework content after such a wide variety of touchpoints: SWC, research findings, Stakeholder reviews, after collab cycle reviews. And this all happens before Staging Review.
- 

**TBD how to categorize**
- we staff practice areas differently, but have same expectations of practice leads. Like we have tons of designers, a good amount of researchers, hardly any accessibility people, no content writers, and no IA people, but we have one practice lead for each of those areas - expectations will need to be different.
- is this the way it's supposed to be right now: OCTO-DE Product Owner has final say, and in disagreement cases it gets escalated to Crew Chief.
- as a VFS OCTO-DE Lead, sometimes I want to be able to push back on VA stakeholders who want to ship something just to ship, by saying "no look we can't bc we don't have platform approval"
- w/CEDAR coming there'll be more teams, and thus more ppl doing work. Now is time to figure out what things CTO's office etc need to be responsible for vs, what are we willing to cede to contractors?
- Will never be able to outsource "why we do design in this way" convos w/stakeholders
- Might need to find a way to start doing IA-focused research and continuing to audit/eval a11y of our components etc

## How might we...
_...define what kind of practice leadership responsibilities are needed in our ecosystem, what is needed for someone to be **successful** at those responsibilities, in what ways the current individuals who've been tagged by others with this role **do** and **do not** desire to assume those responsibilities, where those responsibilities may overlap, conflict with, or compliment Collab Cycle responsibilities, and thus where we have gaps that OCTO-DE will need to figure out how to fill?_

## 3-bucket design strategy

**policy**
- memo for Charles and Chris to review next week ideally
- 5 design policies: 1) for VA.gov must use DS 2) - 5) this is the process and the process for when you need to go outside of DS

**tooling**
- everybody using sketch for teams and having access to it
- so all work is in same sketch for team's instance so everyone can see each others' work

**process**
- design.va.gov lets you run experiments, but what are VFS teams are responsible for?
- example: John's team designed new experiences for search, ryan got the design to where he was happy, and this process clarifies how to document why this is the way it is, what did you test, etc.

^ this affects design from a Ryan perspective, in that he'll be in CC, but the goal w/sketch for teams was to move reviews to asynchronous so can just give comments there. could be same for early a11y reviews. potentially for content as well. haven't talked w/meg or mikki about it yet. strategy was designed in mind for async review option for anybody (whether product support, practice leads, etc). No prescription on who should be in ther giving comments and what the process shoudl be, but the goal of Ryan + Kevin is to create a platform for visibility of design work across va.gov so you don't have to chase or Slack design in process.

## workshop ideas
- what problems were practice leads put in place to solve?
- what do folks *think* they're accountable for?
