# Practice leadership workshop brief

The purpose of this workshop is not to _resolve_ the problem space described below, but rather to pinpoint the gaps (in people, skills, policy, etc) that OCTO-DE / OCTO needs to figure out how to fill in order to start improving this problem space.

## Problem space brief

We have a handful of highly skilled individuals at OCTO-DE who are experts in a given field (notably content, accessibility, IA, design, and research) and to whom we look as the protectors of those practices on VA.gov. The term "practice lead" came about organically, grassroots-style, as a way to describe and wrap heads around these people and their role here, however there was never an intentional OCTO-DE creation of this role nor a conscious accepting of this role by these individuals. There's never been any explicit definition of what it means to have this role - what the expectations and responsibilities are, what the needs are for success, and really whether it's indeed these peoples' role at all. All of this results in mismatched understandings of what practice leads and Collab Cycle members or VFS Teams or VA.gov members at large expect of each other, and has been the source of much confusion and frustration.

## How might we...
...define what responsibilities we need covered by the practice leadership space, and where we have gaps, so OCTO and DE leadership have the context they need to define roles and org structure?

## Workshop goals
- Understand the full gamut of what our VA.gov ecosystem needs from practice leadership
- Understand what the current individuals in these roles _want_ to be spending their time on (and what they don't want to be spending their time on)
- Understand some preliminary prioritization from the OCTO-DE viewpoint of those responsibilities
- Understand what gaps we need to fill

## Questions the workshop should answer
- What are VFS teams asking of practice leads today?
- What are Collab Cycle members asking of practice leads today?
- What are OCTO-DE folks asking of practice leads today?
- What work do the practice leads do today that they weren't expecting to?
- What things are practice leads doing today that they believe should be done by someone else? (and is that a different existing entity, or a net new role?)
- In what ways do the current practice leads feel blocked?
- What would practice leads like to be doing that they don't have bandwidth for today?
- What does support look like for the current people in the practice lead roles to be able to execute on their visions / plans / initiatives?

## Desired post-workshop outcomes
- Inform ideation around how to fill those gaps
- Inform role definitions and hiring decisions
- Inform how practice area roles should fit into the crew structure and OCTO / OCTO-DE organizational structure
- Set expectations across the ecosystem about this role, and thusly reduce frustration, swirl, and burnout.

### How this workshop intersects with and ideally compliments other efforts happening within OCTO
There's work being done to stand up Community of Practice Leads within OCTO, and those individuals are meant to be people managers. The information from this workshop should act as background context to help those individuals best support the needs of practice-leadership-related roles, and craft an org structure that empowers those types of roles well to do the responsibilities that get defined.

There's also work being done around the concept of practice area operations roles: folks to consult with VFS teams on their work in the given practice area, and to maintain our process and say "ok we've grown, let's rethink how we do xyz method or process or task." This will be incorporated into the _understanding the full gamut_ and _gaps_ parts of the workshop as things that current practice leads in some areas have already identified, and already have started ideating around.

## More detail on why this is a problem that needs solving

**Practice leads are feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, and work that needs to be happening is going unattended**

- They find themselves often in an arbitration position that they didn't ask for: a VFS team builds a thing that doesn't meet our standards, the collab cycle points it out, but escalates to the practice lead to be the ultimate enforcer if there's disagreement from the VFS side. These are often complex things on which they have no background, yet are expected to make recommendations.
- They often get roped into taking on actual implementation work for VFS teams, as opposed to focusing on overall strategy and providing best practices guidance.
- They have ideas for ways to improve the culture of their craft across the organization, but don't have team members to actually implement (like the recent a11y proposal).
- The research practice lead does all of the collab cycle reviews for VFS research, in addition to their full time job.
- They have never been told what's expected of them, yet it seems a lot of different things are expected of them from different people (like supporting collab cycle, or supporting VFS teams)
- They sometimes find that OCTO-DE doesn't understand their practice area or the time that goes into it, it sometimes feels under-valued when compared to the directive to ship ship ship
- They get pulled into this or that high priority OCTO-DE initiative, but should they be prioritizing that? Or should they be prioritizing catching off the rails stuff happening on VA.gov work? Or supporting VFS teams with implementation?
- Not all practice areas have the same volume of people supporting them, for exampe we have lots of designers and only one IA, yet expectations for what we want and need from these practice areas are similar.
- They want to be able to rely on VFS teams and POs to make the best possible products, as those people are the experts on their users and their strategies, but they feel they encounter big problems frequently, which takes up a lot of their time.
- They get asked to define big rocks or visions for their practice area and define what they need in order to achieve them, but then get no support or staffing to implement the vision, yet get asked to provide updates on their progress.
- Many feel totally burned out from doing so much, and yet if you look at their big rocks there's no progress.
- It's frustrating that it seems like OCTO-DE is still just building new stuff all over the place making the site more and more fragmented -- feels like feature bloat instead of strategic evolution. As practice leads, it feels like that delivery-first culture is at odds with what they're here to do, and it's frustrating. Thought the new crews concept would make this better, but it hasn't.

**Collab cycle member pain**
- Collab Cycle members often fill in the gap in implementation help when a VFS team doesn't have the appropriate skills, and when the practice lead doesn't have the bandwidth. It's taxing to have to either pick up that extra work because they want to be helpful, or alternatively explain that essentially there's no one to help and the team's out of luck.
- Collab cycle members at times spend time and energy providing reviews of VFS work, when unbeknownst to them the practice lead has either already given a separate OK, or is still working with the VFS team on their strategy - this leads to wasted collab cycle member efforts and they have limited bandwidth already so can be pretty frustrating.

**VFS team pain**
- Have to rework content after a wide variety of touchpoints: SWC, research findings, Stakeholder reviews, after collab cycle reviews. And this all happens before Staging Review.
- It's a bit of a blocker to have just one person reviewing all the research plans
- In the case of IA, there are no IA people on any VFS team, yet we ask them to do their own IA strategy and definition. They also don't have the global knowledge necessary to be able to really make well-informed IA decisions.

### Other general notes from folks
- The size of the org has grown a lot, but we haven't revamped practice area operations to suit our new bigger-org needs.
- We staff practice areas differently, but have same expectations of practice leads. Like we have tons of designers, a good amount of researchers, hardly any accessibility people, no content writers, and no IA people, but we have one practice lead for each of those areas - expectations will need to be different.
- We have officially stated that the OCTO-DE Product Owner has final say, and in disagreement cases it gets escalated to Crew Chief (not the practice lead).
- W/CEDAR coming there'll be more VFS teams, and thus more ppl doing work. Now is time to figure out what things CTO's office etc need to be responsible for vs, what are we willing to cede to contractors?
- Will never be able to outsource "why we do design in this way" convos w/stakeholders to contractors

**3-bucket design strategy**

Policy
- memo for Charles and Chris to review next week ideally
- 5 design policies: 1) for VA.gov must use DS 2) - 5) this is the process and the process for when you need to go outside of DS

Tooling
- everybody using sketch for teams and having access to it
- so all work is in same sketch for team's instance so everyone can see each others' work

Process
- design.va.gov lets you run experiments, but what are VFS teams are responsible for?
- example: John's team designed new experiences for search, ryan got the design to where he was happy, and this process clarifies how to document why this is the way it is, what did you test, etc.

^ this affects design from a Ryan perspective, in that he'll be in CC, but the goal w/sketch for teams was to move reviews to asynchronous so can just give comments there. could be same for early a11y reviews. potentially for content as well. haven't talked w/meg or mikki about it yet. strategy was designed in mind for async review option for anybody (whether product support, practice leads, etc). No prescription on who should be in ther giving comments and what the process shoudl be, but the goal of Ryan + Kevin is to create a platform for visibility of design work across va.gov so you don't have to chase or Slack design in process.

**Workshop ideas**
- what problems were practice leads put in place to solve?
- what do folks *think* they're accountable for?
- maybe follow-up on the individual stuff -- is this the kind of job you want to be doing?
- individual convos (not group) around: if we were to hire for these which would we want to do that for?
- workshop: focus more on parameters around what the needs are and what a practice lead role would look like and what kind of support that would require


**Placeholder "wants"**
- Want a research ops lead who consults when teams are putting together research plans, and to maintain our process and say "ok we've grown, let's rethink how we do synthesis or how we share our research"
- Working on a research revamp this quarter, but sure we'll need more of that in the future -- can see research ops being a full time job for at least one person maybe more
- The research ops person doesn't have to be octo-de / usds, but want a really great researcher in that role. could still be that octo sponsor though for collab / questions / oversight if needed. there's a lot of day to day stuff that would be great for someone to truly own.
- Would be great to have some structure for research side in design intent
- We need dedicated IAs for helping VFS teams. For defining IA standards and coordinating with collab cycle IA. Collab cycle IA to monitor and enforce, the glue between the VFS teams, see what's going out, what's crashing, conflicting. Big Rocks IA for navigation system and slimming down the benefit hubs. And we need a health IA. If we just have me and Mikki, there's a lot that doesn't get done.
