# Domo dashboarding and Google Analytings reporting services paused until mid-June 2021

## Background
Domo KPI Dashboards - while they're super useful - take a really long time to create (about 4 weeks on average) because each one is bespoke. We need to take on a data infrastructure project to get our data architected such that we can churn dashboards out more quickly going forward, and in the long term be able to create a self-service data viz option.

**The good news is:** we're going to invest in that data infrastructure work now so our future can be brighter.

**The bad news is:** since the 2 people architecting that infrastructure are the same 2 people who do all the dashboarding and reporting, Domo Dashboarding and Google Analytics Reporting services will be on hold until June.

## What this means for VFS teams
- New Domo dashboards and GA reports, and updates to Domo dashboards and GA reports will be paused from April 1 - mid-June 2021 
- Analytics team members will be available to answer questions during Collab Cycle Office Hours on Wednesdays, 11:30-12pm EST. Pop in if you need help!
- The Analytics team will continue offering Google Tag Manager implementation services. Use their [issue template](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=joanneesteban&labels=analytics-insights%2C+analytics-request%2C+collaboration-cycle%2C+collab-cycle-review%2C+gtm&template=analytics-implementation-and-qa-request-template.md&title=Analytics+Implementation+or+QA+Support+for+%5BTeam+Name+-+Feature+Name%5D) when you need to get new tracking added to your product or feature.
- You can still go spelunking in Google Analytics. You can even create your own reports and funnels there, [learn how here](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1151300?hl=en#zippy=%2Cclick-to-expand-and-learn-more-about-the-report-types).
- You can still reference any existing Domo dashboards and GA reports, those aren't going away 

## What this means for Platform teams
- Getting additional data-sources piped into BigQuery and Domo (sources like GitHub, Datadog, etc) is on hold, so you'll need to find scrappier ways to track and report out on your initiative KPIs

Thanks for your patience and understanding!
