# VA Trauma Community
Welcome to the VA trauma community ✨
We're a grassroots, volunteer led practice focused on maturing our approach to trauma from facilitating research to caring for practitioners.

## How do I join?
There's no "official" way of joining, but we usually recommend to:
- If you have access to it, join our slack channel at #trauma-practice. Don't have access to slack? Reach out to Josh at josh.kim@adhocteam.us for help.
- [Read how we work together and our community guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ThZJdZZYxgQV5aH83rViAoktf9Oafre3PQMk7eRsDzY/edit?usp=sharing).
- Participate in a way that's most comfortable to you! You can...
  - Introduce yourself on slack at #trauma-practice or at the next practice meeting (this is 100% optional 💙)
  - Read or participate on slack conversations online
  - Sign up for the next small group or join our next practice meeting
  - Check out our [past shared learnings in our notes folder](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/teams/shared-support/trauma/notes)
