## Key Summary

### Using the lanugage that a veteran uses

- Pertaining to the first tip on [Rachel's list on active listening]((https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C04F9JLSATE/p1699307205032219), Rachel points out that this line of thinking extends to the language of veteran culture and how it may differ within that culture. Examples she gave are differences in language for someone who is a combat veteran compared with a veteran who has not deployed, or someone serving in-country vs overseas.
