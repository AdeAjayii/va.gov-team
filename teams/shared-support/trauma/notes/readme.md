- Discussed three ways of meeting: practice meetings, small support groups, and drop in hours

`Small Group` `Shared Learning`

A second private group also talked about intuition which unfolded into a conversation around confronting the uncomfortable, marinating our instincts, focusing on the next best thing, and considering an airing of greivances.

`Small Group` `Shared Learning`

A small, private group of 7 talked about intuition which bloomed into a conversation around unlearning, navigating cloudy language, taking on the unplanned, having grace for oneself, and contracting.

- How do we maintain our energy and not burn out? ðŸŒµ
- Do breathing techniques actually work mid-session? ðŸ”¥

`Big Meeting` `Strategy` 

We talked about our purpose again, but this time more as an open conversation and less in a google doc. 
- We realized researchers want a space to practice, learn, and debrief. 
- We also started talking about our future vision.
