## Background
One of the key goals of the modernized VA.gov a11y strategy document is to center and include disabled Veterans (and by extension their caregivers and family members and/or disabled caregivers and disabled family members). Two barriers come to mind:

1. We currently only recruit disabled Veterans for usability testing research, for which the primary purpose is evaluating products as they are being worked on. 
2. We are unclear about the degree to which disabled Veterans participate in the VA's existing feedback methods; it is possible that disabled Veterans find these feedback methods to be inaccessible, thereby limiting their ability to provide feedback that can inform our understanding of their broader needs, gaps in products, and issues with the VA.gov website. 

To address that gap, we would like to establish a process to collect accessibility (a11y) feedback from the public.

## Research Goals
Our goal is to establish a process to collect a11y feedback from the public. In order to accomplish this goal, we need to‚Ä¶
- determine whether disabled Veterans are providing feedback through existing feedback mechanisms (and if not, why not?), and
- start to gain preliminary insight or determine next steps on how to gain insights into disabled Veteran's behaviors, feelings, perspectives, and expectations on providing a11y feedback

## Focus areas
- How accessible (and to a degree usable) are current feedback methods on VA.gov? 
- Where do disabled Veterans currently provide or expect to be able to provide a11y feedback on VA.gov (if at all)?
- What are all the current existing mechanisms (accessible or not)?
- What kind of a11y feedback do disabled Veterans provide (or want to provide) on VA.gov? 
- Do some subgroups (or individuals) among disabled Veterans have a greater need (if at all) for providing and resolving accessibility feedback more than others?
- How is a11y feedback for VA.gov currently processed?
- What mental models do disabled Veterans have of the a11y feedback process on VA.gov?

## Constraints, Assumptions, and Risks
This is bootstrapped research with little to no formal funding (yet), we currently cannot conduct an independent qualitative study. We can however add on or append to existing studies with disabled Veterans, interview key informants (who aren‚Äôt Veterans from the public), and investigate existing processes.
As we can only append to existing studies or rely on secondary research and key informants, we are limited in who and how we sample. In other words, any insights from this research cannot be established as broader, representative patterns. They can only be interpreted as localized events. For example, if we hear that several Veterans are using the Medallia feedback button, we cannot assume that it is representative of all disabled Veterans, but we can conclude that some Veterans are using it and fund more time into investigating it further.

### Assumptions
- Disabled Veterans have an interest in providing feedback in the first place (we‚Äôll look to prove/disprove this) 
- Disabled Veterans are actively accessing and using VA.gov 

#### Disabled Veterans are a big tent, so we‚Äôll need to be strategic with sampling
- When we refer to ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù in disabled Veteran, we are referring to any Veteran that either identifies with or has been diagnosed with a disability. This may range from Veterans with minor temporary disabilities like migraines, to Veterans with acquired permanent disabilities like TBI or blindness, and Veterans with congenital (from birth) disabilities.
- As a starting point, we may be interested in determining through secondary research (e.g., SME interview with Tim Hornik from the Blinded Veterans Association) if there are any particular subgroups (if at all) that are more likely to provide or need a response from accessibility feedback.
- We‚Äôll want to pay close attention to patterns and differences between different types of disabilities while also acknowledging that no one disabled person is alike. 

## Methodology
We intend on using mixed methods to begin to investigate the research focus areas including:

### Desk research 
- Contact center surveys, extracting survey responses from Veterans based on keywords related to accessibility).
- Page analytics, use google analytics to explore quantitative data related to accessibility searchers, use of Section 508 page, and more.

### Accessibility audits 
Identifying known existing methods of providing feedback and auditing them based on VA.gov platform standards.

### Interviews with Veterans
Append questions to the end of interviews with disabled Veterans to retrieve some qualitative data.

### Key informant interviews
Connect with and interview groups and people involved in existing feedback mechanisms including the contact center panel, a BVA representative, the Section 508 office, and more.

## Research Questions

- **How accessible (and to a degree, usable) are current feedback methods on VA.gov?**
  - From secondary research, is a11y feedback being received at all?
  - Have prior audits been conducted? When were they conducted? Were they maintained?
  - If not, can we determine how legally compliant and usable existing tools are (to a subjective degree)?
- **Where do disabled Veterans currently provide or expect to provide a11y feedback on VA.gov (if at all)?**
  - What were failed attempts at providing feedback like? (if any)
  - Where do Veterans go first to provide feedback?
  - Is their feedback active or reactive?
- **What kind of a11y feedback do disabled Veterans provide (or want to provide) on VA.gov?**
  - Are there gaps in the issues we‚Äôve identified and the feedback Veterans want to provide?
  - Which issues would make the most impact if they were remediated? 
- **Do some subgroups (or individuals) among disabled Veterans have a greater need (if at all) for providing and resolving accessibility feedback more than others?**
- **How is a11y feedback for VA.gov currently processed?**
  - Are there any existing processes in place? Are they mapped out?
  - How does a11y feedback travel from different parts of the organization?
  - How do we respond back to Veterans?
- **What mental models do disabled Veterans have of the a11y feedback process on VA.gov?**
  - Do their mental models cohesively align with the actual process? 
  - Are there any unintended mismatches?

## Contact Center Surveys
Medallia offers a method to get .CSV exports of feedback from Veterans through the intercept survey and feedback button.

## [Page Analytics](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/shared-support/accessibility/reports/accessibility-footer-analytics.md)

Eli Mellen conducted research into the page analytics of the ‚ÄúAccessibility‚Äù link in the footer.

### Key insights üß≠
- Between January 1 and November 17, 2022, the accessibility link in the footer of modernized va.gov pages was clicked 26,005.
- Of those clicks, 18,123 of them were triggered from a mobile device.
- The 508 page received 56,290 page views, this means that about 46% of all traffic to the 508 accessibility page came through the footer link.

### Unknowns, risks, and limitations ü§î
- This data was analyzed at a very preliminary level; there is an opportunity to do a deeper analysis with a more longitudinal set of data.

### Outstanding tasks and questions ‚ÅâÔ∏è
- A goal of follow up data analysis could be to develop a user journey map that converges on providing feedback.
- This data analysis revealed that a high percentage of folks who clicked on the accessibility link were using mobile devices, this suggests there is an opportunity to do more focused studies on the va.gov experience from mobile devices.
- We have determined that there is traffic from the footer to the 508 page ‚Äì a follow up analysis should be done to determine why folks are going to the 508 page and if they are able to find what they are looking for there.   

## [Accessibility Audits](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sQ0qNE9Ne_cU1kjnyw29whXLiqAJI9b9VydHlPqWiWg/edit?usp=sharing)
As an extension of secondary research, we plan on also conducting an accessibility audit depending on the existence and quality of prior accessibility audits for the following tools:

### What our audits covered
- VA.gov Feedback Button 
  - Some major issues with magnification devices.
  - Informed ian.mccullough@oddball.io of these defects.
- VA.gov Intercept Survey 
  - Some major issues with magnification devices. Repetitive and verbose on a screen reader.
  - Informed ian.mccullough@oddball.io of these defects.
- Section 508 Page 
  - 5 major accessibility issues. 15 year old page.
  - Created a new accessibility statement to address this. Replaces old link under ‚Äúaccessibility‚Äù in the footer. New a11y statement analytics can be tracked on google analytics.
  - Need to inform Section 508 team of a11y issues on the Section 508 page.
- Virtual Agent (chatbot) 
  - Major issues were left unresolved as they could only be fixed by Microsoft.
  - Need to inform chatbot team of issues. 
- Ask.va.gov 
  - Noted as inaccessible in interview with contact center panel. Poor usability on mobile devices.
  - Connected Section 508 office with ask.va.gov team.
  - The latest update is there's nothing the 508 Office can do until April-ish timeframe. That is the earliest opportunity there may be an AskVA dev team funded to make design changes. Chris Walker is aware.

### What our audits did not cover
- My VA 411 (800-698-2411) 
  - Anecdotally accessible. Phone number with TTY. Unsure if wait times, customer support, and more create invisible barriers to callers with disabilities.
- IVR Survey 
  - Anecdotally accessible, but similar to My VA 411, needs additional research. Users can use button presses on their phone to submit responses. Those responses are then captured and input into VSignals Medallia dashboard(?).
- Facility QR Codes 
  - Some facilities will have QR codes Veterans can scan and provide feedback to. Veterans can submit through these as many times as they like.
- Email 
  - VEO will sample a selected group of Veterans and send them a link to an online survey through email. Unclear if this is similar to the surveys on VA.gov; but we believe they share the same base format. Differences may emerge if they are housed in a modal or exist on their own page.
Known unknowns 
- We know there are other surveys e.g. by paper, in-person, etc. Dan and Evan from VSignals measurement team would know for sure the full scope.

### Key insights üß≠
- All of the methods of providing feedback to VA.gov that we audited have confirmed major accessibility issues which may prevent disabled people from submitting accessibility feedback.
- 2 of the methods we audited have confirmed severe major accessibility issues which likely completely bars access to providing feedback.
- Many of these methods were audited in the past based on outdated standards (Section 508 follows WCAG 2.0 AA which does not critically cover responsive, mobile, and cognitive considerations). Little (if any) maintenance is conducted post-audit by the Section 508 office, even with the introduction of updated standards.

### Unknowns, risks, and limitations ü§î
- Audits were cursory in nature. They will likely not capture all potential accessibility or usability issues for disabled Veterans. We should consider the existence of issues as a sign that further testing and usability testing with disabled Veterans should be strongly considered.
- We still don‚Äôt know what the full landscape of collecting feedback from Veterans looks like. Connecting with Dan and Evan from the measurements team should give more insight into this.

### Outstanding tasks and questions ‚ÅâÔ∏è
- WCAG 2.1+ (not 508) accessibility audits and usability testing with disabled Veterans using a variety of assistive technology should be conducted for methods we still don‚Äôt have access to (or are unaware of) including the IVR survey, facility QR codes, email, and more.
- More research is needed to understand the disabled Veteran experience of calling My VA 411 as it is currently the only known usable method for disabled Veterans to provide accessibility feedback beyond the Section 508 email.
