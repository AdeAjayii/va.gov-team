# Writing a user guide

This document provides guidance in writing VFS-facing user guides for VSP products. Working through these steps should leave you with a publishable user guide for your product or feature.


## Consider your audience



*   Who is your audience?
*   What are you trying to assist them to do?
    *   Complete a task? → How-to guide
    *   Learn about a topic? → Overview
    *   Understand details about a technical concept or explain best practices? → Reference


## Choose the right document type

What type of document (or documents) best meets the needs of your audience? The table below gives examples of the most common document types for our user guides.

## Write a document

Use a template based on the document type or copy an existing example as a starting point.

Make sure that your writing follows the [VSP documentation style guide](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/documentation/style-guide), paying special attention to formatting of [step-by-step instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/documentation/style-guide/formatting-and-organization.md#procedures) and [code samples](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/documentation/style-guide/developer-content.md#code-samples).


## Send it for review

Have a few people review your document to make sure it’s easy to understand, technically accurate, and editorially solid. At a minimum, have your document reviewed by one other person within your practice area. 

To request a review from someone on the Content and IA team, [create a documentation support issue](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=gmaciolek&labels=content-ia-team%2C+documentation-support&template=documentation-support-request.md) or add @gmaciolek as a reviewer on a PR. 

See the [request documentation support process](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/documentation/request-documentation-support.md) document for more information on working with the Content and IA team.
