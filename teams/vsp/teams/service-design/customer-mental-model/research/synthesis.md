# Platform Card Sort Synthesis

## Takeaways

1. Cards with “enforcement” in the name tended to be grouped together, as opposed to being grouped in with their corresponding practice area.
1. Though the concept of “Monitoring and Performance” came up 5 times as a category, there was a significant amount of discrepancy between what respondents placed in such a category.
1. There were 4 categories that came up for 5 or more respondents, with a common set of cards in them (see [Platform Cart Sort readout](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HwlXwykiBJ2XC7zXlp9YsBr39WsXT4USr88v46nYv7w/edit#slide=id.g94451db3d0_0_25) for details)
1. The category labels provided some great some hints at the type of language we can do further research to explore using: like Users & Security instead of Identity, or like Standards, or Governance instead of Enforcement

## Additional takeaways
- Would be interesting to apply Good Services framework to the themes/categories
- How applicable would this really be for documentation, esp since it isn't based on Eng or Designer mental model?
- Everything today feels like it's following the VSP mental model, and not necessarily the customer
- We almost always think about things in terms of practice area, but those were not used really as categories in the card sort
- If this is a good Product Manager mental model of the platform
- This is like a mental model of how other ppl would describe how our products ar organized, but not necessarily a path throgh all of this, or the most efficient path to take. We need those other slices. "I'm a BE eng, and I'm trying to  build a thing, how do I know what I need to do along the way?"
- Designers have a list of things they need to do when designing, so as they go forth this probably wouldn't be helpful for them.
- Might there be some error if the ppl who took it weren't 100% of what all the technical categories were?


## Ways we might use this information in Platform initiatives
- Internal comms
- Slack automation
  - Could a bot help look for terms and remind ppl of the correct term
  - or "it looks like you're asking about testing tools. are you? if so, here's a section of docs about it)
- Could we work it into VSP documentation guidelines that Gretchen has already developed (normalizing a taxonomy at scale to be a point of reference for all teams to use in any comms things they might do)
  - So you're going to talk about the Platform? Here's a doc to help w/labeling choices, how to orient what the topic is in the larger context of the platform
