# Native Mobile Customer Type Research

Today (Sept 2020) the core customer type that the DEPO Platform is optimized to serve is: VFS teams building on VA.gov. This means we prioritize efforts to improve out support processes, documentation, and tooling to work well for folks launching features on VA.gov, but for VFS teams building things outside of the VA.gov experience, there may be friction and gaps in their experience that we are not prioritizing iteration for right now. We are not positioned yet to intentionally support these new customer types today.

As a part of our future strategy, we want the DEPO Platform to support any VFS team - those building on other web properties like MHV, those building native mobile apps, those publishing campaigns, etc. So! Given that we have a VFS team kicking off right now to build a VA Mobile App, it's an opportunity to start identifying areas in our process and tooling where we don't meet their needs, to inform future prioritization efforts.

So, we have two commitments in our interaction with the VA Mobile team:

1) Consult on the quality of a small subset of critical things: design patterns, security, and privacy
2) Identify areas where our tooling, documentation, and process do, and do not suit the needs of a native mobile customer type
