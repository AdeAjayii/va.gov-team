# Contact Center Tier II/III Support

## Overview
Tier II and III support for contact centers provides escalated support when contact center representatives are unable to solve Veterans' problems without further assistance.

## Problem Statement
When things don't work as expected or when Veterans cannot find the information they need on VA.gov and are prevented from completing their tasks, there's a problem. Our primary goals is to provide contact center staff with the right resources to help solve those problems (tier I) for Veterans. When contact center representatives cannot solve those problems, they forward those problems to us (tier II/III). We (contact center team) first try to solve the problems through our troublshooting process and resources but sometimes have to forward to VFS teams (who owns the site pages) to fix the issues. 

## Personas
Veterans and their family members are the primary users of VA.gov for which we provide this support.*

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* Number of issues by tier - looking for improvement over time compared to previous/baseline data (we want to reduce #s in every area) 
* Number of issues by type - i.e. team, task, etc...

## Assumptions
- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
