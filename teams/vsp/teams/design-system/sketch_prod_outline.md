# Sketch for Teams Product Outline - DRAFT

## Overview

The Sketch for teams will be a tool used by designers to collaborate, stay in sync with the Sketch Library and provide awareness of other teams projects on va.gov. The Sketch Library will be part of the cloud workspace so designers can access existing design system components, patterns and templates. 

Sketch for Teams can also be used by stakeholders, product managers and developers. 

## Problem Statement

Designers have to manually update their Sketch Libraries which can result in inconsistencies across designs. The existing manual process is tedious as it requires the DST designer to update a Github link every 2 weeks and rely on designers to delete their current Sketch Library and replace it with the updated one. 

Designers do not know when another designer is working on the same design pattern since everyone is working in their own silo, with some designers using different tools. 

Designers have different tools to share their mockups so there is no consistent way of sharing design mockups and getting feedback. 

We believe that using Sketch for Teams will improve consistency across designs and promote collaboration between teams. 

## Personas

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Adoption of Sketch for Team by designers  

- Increased consistency of how designers share mockups 

  

#### Baseline KPI Values

## Assumptions

- Sketch for Teams will increase consistency across designs of applications 
- Sketch for Teams will improve cross team collaboration (especially when working on the same pattern)

## Solution Approach

*Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:*

- We will migrate designers from the current process and tools to Sketch for Teams

- Sketch for Teams is a cloud-based application and most of our designers use Sketch.
