# Sketch Product Outline - DRAFT

## Overview

The Sketch Library is a part of the VA Design System that is a tool used by designers. The Sketch Library contains reusable components that are part of the design system to design and build applications. 


## Problem Statement

The Design System Team believes VFS Designers are confused by inconsistencies across design system documentation, tools, and production applications.  We believe that improving consistency by identifying and communicating a “source of truth” version for components and patterns will increase the number of new or variant components launched and help us track the actual usage of components and patterns across our production applications.



## Personas

Designers

## Measuring Success

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

* *What data (qual or quant) will you look at to understand if your initial set of functionality is meeting your desired user and business outcomes, and not bringing about the undesired outcomes?*
* _What are the most important metrics that track with this product/initiative's success?_
* _Include links to Grafana or other dashboards/reports where possible_

#### Baseline KPI Values

* _Baseline values for those most critical metrics, if possible._

---

## Assumptions

- *Include indication of which assumption you think is most risky. Your Solution Approach (next section) should describe how you'll validate that assumption w/your initial set of functionality*

## Solution Approach

_Describe, in a few sentences and/or bullet points, what you plan to build, and how it will solve the problem. Some questions to think about:_

- *What are you going to build now, and why have you decided to start there?*
- *Why this solution / approach over other solutions / approaches?*
- *What have you explicitly decided to not include in this initial set of functionality, and why?*
- *How will the solution / approach evolve after this initial build (knowing that this will likely change as you learn from users along the way)?*

_For non-trivial technical solutions, an [engineering design doc](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/platform/engineering/design-docs) should be written to deeply explain **How** this product will be built._
