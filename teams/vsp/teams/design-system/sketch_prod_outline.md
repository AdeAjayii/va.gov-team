# Sketch Libary Product Outline

## Overview

The Sketch Library is a tool used by designers to stay in sync with the design system where they can access existing design system components, patterns and templates. 

## Problem Statement

Designers do not know when another designer is working on the same design pattern since everyone is working in their own silo, with some designers using different tools. 
Designers have different tools to share their mockups so there is no consistent way of sharing design mockups and getting feedback. 

We believe that using Sketch Library mprove consistency across designs and promote collaboration between teams.
