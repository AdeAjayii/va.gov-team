## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Kavitha and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about using the burial benefits form and more specifically the review page
Before we start, a few things I want to mention:
- **This entire session should take about 60 minutes.** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.**  We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- **You'll be interacting with a prototype.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.**
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly.
- **If yes: Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.**
*Start recording.* 
- **I have started recording.** I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today?


## Warm-up Questiona - 5 - 10 minutes

Before we look at the website, letâ€™s start with a few warm-up questions.

- What VA forms have you filled out in the past? Do you remember how long it took?
- What device do you use to fill out the forms? On your phone, computer, etc.?
- Typically, who fills out the forms? (You or does someone else help you fill the forms?)
- Talk to me about when and how you usually verify information before submitting the form?
- Please talk to me about your experience editing or correcting any entry on this page? 


## First Task: Walk through the form - 5 minutes

We are going to be looking at the burial benefits for today. As I mentioned, this is a prototype so it might not work the way you expect it to.

*Please take a couple of minutes to look at this page - this is the information you would need to fill out if you were actually completing this process.* 

*Imagine you are entering the information in this page. Once you are done, please click on the Continue button (participants would do this for multiple pages with the guidance of the moderator).* 


## Second Task: Review page design feedback (30minutes)

**Existing design**

*Imagine that you filled out all the required information and you arrived at this page. Please take a couple of minutes to look at this page.*

- What would you do when you get here in the application process?
- What do you think is the purpose of this page?
    - Are you able to easily accomplish that? Why or why not?
    - Please talk to me about how easy it is to review the information in this page (feedback about accordion design)? 
    - How would you like to see the information displayed? (always visible or open as required)?
- Imagine, you notice an error on this page and you want to fix the mistake
    - Where would you click to fix the mistake?
    - What do you think would happen when you do that? (based on what the participant says to the previous question)
    - What do you like/dislike the most about this page? Why?
    - Talk to me about what is easy and not easy to use on this page? Alternate: what would you change about this? Why?

**Design Variation with Value Emphasis**


- Design Varioation with Label Emmphasis
- Design Variation with Open Accordion

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
