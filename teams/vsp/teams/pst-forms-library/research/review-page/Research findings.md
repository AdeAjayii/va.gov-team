# Research Goals
This research will help us understand:

Veteran's general experience around filling out forms
Veteran's practices around the Review Page
Which of the three Review page design options work best for Veterans


# Research Questions

- How Veterans use the Review Page in the forms experience by using the Application for Burial Benefits form Review Page as an example?
- What are the pain points and issues on the Review Page of the Application for Burial Benefits form experience?
- How Veterans interact with the Review Page components? (help determine which of the design variations best suit their needs)


# Methodology 

The team conducted 1:1 semi-structured interview over zoom with Veterans to understand their experience working with the current Review Page. 
- The team chose the Burial Benefits form (21P-530) to research with Veterans.
- We presented three proposed variations to identify which design best suits Veteran needs for reviewing and editing prior to form submission. 



# Hypotheses and Conclusions

True - Veterans find it easier to quickly review all the information in the Review page with information always visible. <br>
True - Veterans find it easier to edit individal data fields rather than entire sections. <br>
More information required (planning futher research) - Veterans find it easier to edit any information that might need updating on the original page rather than the Review page.
