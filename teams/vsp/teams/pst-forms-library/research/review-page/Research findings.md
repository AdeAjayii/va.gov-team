# Research Goals
This research will help us understand:

Veteran's general experience around filling out forms
Veteran's practices around the Review Page
Identify which of the three Review page design options work best for Veterans


# Research Questions

- How Veterans use the Review Page in the forms experience by using the Application for Burial Benefits form Review Page as an example?
- What are the pain points and issues on the Review Page of the Application for Burial Benefits form experience?
- How Veterans interact with the Review Page components? (help determine which of the design variations best suit their needs)


# Methodology 

- The team conducted 1:1 semi-structured interview over zoom with Veterans to understand their experience working with the current Review Page. 
- The team chose the Burial Benefits form (21P-530) to research with Veterans.
- We presented three proposed variations to identify which design best suits Veteran needs for reviewing and editing prior to form submission. 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

TRUE - Veterans find it easier to quickly review all the information in the Review page with information always visible. <br>
TRUE - Veterans find it easier to edit individal data fields rather than entire sections. <br>
MAYBE TRUE - Veterans find it easier to edit any information that might need updating on the original page rather than the Review page.


# Key Findings

- 5 out of 6 Participants preferred Design Option #2 for the following reasons: 
-- Visibility of information - always visible to review
-- Edit option - ability to edit  individual data fields  
- All participants preferred the Review page with the information always open so they can review the information with ease. 
- 4 out of 6 participants preferred the editing individual fields instead of entire sections to avoid editing other fields by mistake. The other two participants preferred to edit the entire section instead of individual data fields to edit entire section/multiple data fields at the same time thus saving time and effort. 
- No participant interacted with anchors in the top of the page until prompted.  However, all participants valued the ability to easily get to a section from the top of the page.


# Details of Findings 

_For each finding, list details with supporting quotes and images when possible.

# Additional Insights

- All participants were unsure if their family would have access to their military history information that is required to fill out the burial benefits form.
- 3 out of the 6 participants expected for certain sections of the burial benefits form to be auto-filled based on Social Security Number or with the help of VA assistance.
- One participant said they would prefer a bigger font size for better readability.


# Recommendations

_Put together initial recommendations here based on your findings along with supporting evidence. Review with your team, then edit as needed._

* Recommendation 1
    * _Supporting evidence_
* Recommendation 2
    * _Supporting evidence_


# Next Steps

- Engineers will create a working prototype of the Review page pattern based on Design #2 
- Edit option in the working prototype will take Veterans back to the appropriate form page and anchors on the field that was chosen to edit



# Further research needed

- Furtherresearch with Veterans to get feedback on desktop designs, accessibility issues and the new edit design
