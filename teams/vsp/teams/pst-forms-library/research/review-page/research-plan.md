# Research Plan for Forms Library Team, Review Page, Apr - May 2022
 

## Background
The team reviewed all previous research associated with the current Review Page pattern. We learnt that multiple research studies had been conducted with developers and designers to better understand their experience building forms using the current Forms Library. However, there has been no research with Veterans regarding their experience using the current Review Page. As a result, it was decided that one project goal is to plan and execute research with Veterans on their experience working with the current Review Page and two proposed variations. Based on Veteran feedback, one Review page variation will be chosen to implement as part of the Q2 Working Demo. The team has chosen the Application for Burial Benefits form (21P-530) to research with Veterans.


### OCTO Objectives 

This research effort will inform [Q2 2022 Objective] (https://vfs.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FLT/pages/1992589392/Roadmap+Current#Q2-2022): Build a working demo of the first iteration of the VA Forms System Core. <br>

This is the first step on the path to achieving the long-term initiative of providing a tool that teams working on the platform can use to easily spin up and build forms that provide a consistent veteran user experience across the VA.gov site. 

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)?
Are there moments that matter? 

## Research Goals	
The Forms Library Team aims to understand:

- How Veterans use the Review Page in the form experience and more specifically the Application for Burial Benefits form Review Page
- Identify pain points and accessibility issues on the Review Page of the Application for Burial Benefits form experience
- How Veterans interact with the Review Page components in order to determine which of the two design variation best suit their needs 


### Outcome
How will this research advance your product to the next phase in the design process? What will you do with your learnings?

### Research questions
<h4>General VA form filling experience </h4>
1. What VA forms have you filled out in the past?
2. Typically, who fills out the forms? (You or does someone else help you fill the forms?)
3. What device do you use to fill out the forms? On your phone, computer, etc.?
4. Typically, how long does it take for you to fill a form? <br>

<h4>Review Page </h4>
1. When in the process do you usually verify the information before submitting the form?
2. Please talk to me about your experience editing or correcting any entry on the Review Page? <br>

<h4>Design Options </h4>
1. Compare the three design options to identify which better suits your need
2. Open versus closed accordion
3. Editing in Review page versus the original page
4. Edit button per section or one for each element
5. Using ‘edit’ versus ‘change’ (terminology) <br>

<h4> Pain Points</h4>
1. Thinking about the Review Page specifically, what are some of the things you like and don’t like about using the Review Page?
2. Can you talk to me about some other forms you have filled out in the past and how easy or hard it was for your to complete the form(s)


### Hypothesis
What do you intend to learn and measure from this study? Think through these prompts to develop a strong hypothesis.
- What do you already know about this problem space?
- What do you think users will do or think about this product? (Identifying our assumptions helps us be aware of biases we may unintentionally bring into the study, so don’t skip this step!)
- Write a generalized statement that combines what you know + what you think will happen during the study. 
- Remember to constrain the hypothesis to the goals of your study!

## Method	
60 mins 1:1 semi-structured interview with 6 Veterans and 1 pilot session with a team member

To talk about their experiences filling out forms (10mins)
Share the burial form prototype and fill out a couple of pages to get them grounded (10mins)
Talk about Review Page in general (do they review before submission, do they edit before submission) (10mins)
Share the three variations of the Review page and compare the three design options to identify which better suits your need
Open versus closed accordion
Editing in Review page versus the original page
Edit button per section or one for each element
Using ‘edit’ versus ‘change’ (terminology)
Task - request the participant to edit a typo in a specific form field to observe how participants find/edit information

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Pro tip:
- For remote moderated studies with Veterans and caregivers, we recommend using Perigean to recruit participants. 
- Perigean cannot recruit VA employees or VSOs. Work with your VA lead to recruit these groups. 
- Perigean can also support remote, unmoderated studies, however, these studies require strict recruitment requirements. (Additional guidance forthcoming; reach out to #research-ops in the interim.)

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. Read this [introduction to inclusive research](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/introduction.md) and use the [recruitment checker (google sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity.

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
If you are using Perigean to recruit please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote research, 2+ weeks for in person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
What dates do you plan to do research? 

### Length of sessions
How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. 
Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 
Please request enough dates and time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.).
