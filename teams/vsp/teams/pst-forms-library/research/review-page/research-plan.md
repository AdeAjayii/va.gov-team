# Research Plan for Forms Library Team on Review Page
Apr - May 2022
 

## Background
The team reviewed all previous research associated with the current Review Page pattern. We learnt that multiple research studies had been conducted with developers and designers to better understand their experience building forms using the current Forms Library. However, there has been no research with Veterans regarding their experience using the current Review Page. As a result, it was decided that one project goal is to plan and execute research with Veterans on their experience working with the current Review Page and two proposed variations. Based on Veteran feedback, one Review page variation will be chosen to implement as part of the Q2 Working Demo. The team has chosen the Application for Burial Benefits form (21P-530) to research with Veterans.


### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following objectives
1. Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
2. Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

### Veteran Journey
This research fits into these points of a Veteran's Journey where they might need to fill out a form:

Getting Out <br>
Starting up <br>
Taking care of myself <br>
Reinventing myself <br>
Putting down roots <br>
Retiring<br>
Aging<br>
Dying

## Research Goals	
The Forms Library Team aims to understand:

- How Veterans use the Review Page in the forms experience by using the Application for Burial Benefits form Review Page as an example
- Pain points and accessibility issues on the Review Page of the Application for Burial Benefits form experience
- How Veterans interact with the Review Page components in order to determine which of the design variations best suit their needs 


### Outcome
The findings from this research will help the team better understand Veteran needs and expectations around the Review Page (after completion but before submission of a form). Based on use, Veteran expectation and preference, a Review Page pattern that best suits Veteran needs will be chosen to build in the Q2 Working Demo. 


### Research questions
This research will help us understand:
- Veteran's general experience around filling out forms
- Veteran's practices around Review page
- Which of the three Review page design options work best for Veterans  

### Hypothesis 
Veterans prefer to quickly review all the information in the same Review page. <br>
Veterans would prefer to edit any information that might need updating in the original page rather than the Review page. 

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated usability studies using a high fidelity Sketch prototype. This round of research is focused on the mobile version of the designs.

### Location
Remote research using Zoom

### Research materials (To be added)

Provide a link to any materials you need to run your study, including any materials needed for set up and recruitment.
