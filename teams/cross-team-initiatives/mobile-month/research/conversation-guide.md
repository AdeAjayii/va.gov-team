*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Make sure you have the mobile research guidelines and are prepared to walk someone through how to install zoom on their phones if they don't have it, or the laptop hugging technique

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is [NAME] and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to have you take a look at VA.gov on your phone and explore what's working and not working about that experience.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - X minutes

Before we look at the website, can you tell me a little about yourself? What part of the country do you live in? What branch did you serve?

## Logistics: figure out how to share your screen

- Step 1
- Step 2


## First Task: VA.gov navigation and content - X minutes

- I'd like you to go to VA.gov on your device. Now imagine you're interested in going back to school and you've heard there are benefits that can help you with that. How would you look for these benefits?  

### Things to watch for:

- Do they use search or browse?
- How do they interact with the header if at all?
- How do they interact with navigation if at all?
- If they don't get to the "hub page" show this to them https://www.va.gov/education/

## Second Task: Form - X minutes

- You've decided to apply for the GI bill and other related education benefits. What would you do?
- If they can't find it, lead them here: https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/

### Things to watch for:

- How do they find the application?
- What is it like navigating through the Wizard for them?
- How long does it take to load the form / their thoughts?
- Do they see they can apply not logged in?
- How do they interact with the form? https://www.va.gov/education/apply-for-education-benefits/application/1990/applicant/information


## Third Task: Facility Locator - X minutes

- Now let's say you need to get a COVID test and heard they run these at VA urgent care facilities. How would you find an urgent care facility close to you?  

### Things to watch for:

- How do they use our tool? what trips them up?
- What are their expectations regarding the map and list views?
- What do they think about geolocation? and popluting a full address? What would they do to change it?

## Fourth Task: Claims Status Tool - X minutes

- OK now I'm going to share a different URL with you (staging URL). Let's say you want to see the status of one of your claims, what would you do?  

### Things to watch for:

- X


## Post-Task Interview - X minutes

- Question 1
- Question 2
- Any questions for me? 

## Thank-You and Closing - X minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Thanks! Lastly, do you know any other Veterans, caregivers, or service members who might be willing to participate in a future user research session? 
    If Yes: Thank you! I'll have our team send you an email with a little blurb that you can pass along. 

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
