# Mobile Month Conversation Guide

## Moderator logistics

*Use [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/messages/C40B45NJK/details/) in Slack for real-time feedback from observers.*

*Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).*

*In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute*

*In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked*

*Check your [screensharing setup]*

*When the participant is ready, begin the session with the following intro*

### Project-specific setup

- [ ] Make sure you have the mobile research guidelines and are prepared to walk someone through how to install zoom on their phones if they don't have it, or the laptop hugging technique 
- [ ] Open VA.gov in a new tab and hit Command+Alt+J to put it in mobile view in case moderator needs to share screen as a backup

## Intro - 5 minutes

Thanks for joining us today! My name is Shawna/Liz and I also have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to have you take a look at VA.gov on your phone and explore what's working and not working about that experience.

Before we start, a few things I want to mention:

- **This entire session should take about [time].** I want to be sure not to keep you much longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or topic.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** We are not testing your ability. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veteran's needs. I will not be offended by any opinions you express, and I welcome your feedback.
- [IF APPROPRIATE:] **You'll be interacting with a prototypes and a demo tool.** This is a demo tool that may not function exactly the way you expect. Some areas of the prototype will be clickable, and some will not. Since it's a demo, none of your actions will affect your actual VA information or benefits.
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 
- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen the audio as we talk today? 

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes

- Before we look at the website, can you tell me a little about yourself? What part of the country do you live in? What branch did you serve?
- What type of phone do you use? How do you typically use it? Breakdown of phone versus desktop?

## Logistics: figure out how to share your screen - 5 minutes

- Confirm with the participant in the beginning of the session that they are using a mobile device with Zoom installed
- If not, backup plan - load VA.gov in a "mobile frame" - open VA.gov in Chrome. Hit Command+Alt+J.  Backup to backup - moderator shares screen.

Let's start by making sure you can figure out how to share your screen on Zoom. 

- Note the security warning users will see upon sharing screen
- For troubleshooting screen sharing in iOS, reference the [Zoom documentation here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005890803-iOS-Screen-Sharing). [For Android, try here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362153-Sharing-your-screen)
- Record the session still!
- Ask participant to be mindful of thinking outloud since you will not be able to see a mouse cursor go through the prototype


## First Task: VA.gov navigation and content - 7 minutes

- I'd like you to go to VA.gov on your device. Now imagine you're interested in going back to school and you've heard there are benefits that can help you with that. How would you look for these benefits?  

### Things to watch for:

- Do they use search or browse?
- If they search, what is that like? What about browsing?
- How do they interact with the header if at all?
- How do they interact with navigation if at all?
- If they don't get to the "hub page" show this to them https://www.va.gov/education/

## Second Task: Form - 8 minutes

- You've decided to apply for the GI bill and other related education benefits. What would you do?
- If they can't find it, lead them here: https://www.va.gov/education/how-to-apply/ (they don't have to go through the whole thing)

### Things to watch for:

- How do they find the application?
- What is it like navigating through the Wizard for them?
- How long does it take to load the form / their thoughts?
- Do they see they can apply not logged in?
- How do they interact with the form? https://www.va.gov/education/apply-for-education-benefits/application/1990/applicant/information


## Third Task: Facility Locator - 10 minutes

- Now let's say you need to get a COVID test and heard they run these at VA urgent care facilities. How would you find an urgent care facility close to you?  

### Things to watch for:

- How do they use our tool? what trips them up?
- What are their expectations regarding the map and list views?
- What do they think about geolocation and popluting a full address? What would they do to change it?

## Fourth Task: Claims Status Tool - 10 minutes

* Do you have any current claims or appeals in process with VA.gov?
   * If YES, Can you show me what would you do from your phone to see what's happening with those claims or appeals?
   * If NO, user can stop sharing their screen. Moderator logs in to staging as vets.gov.user+228@gmail.com, switches to mobile view (Alt+Command+J in chrome) and shares screen. What would you do to see what's happening with your claims and appeals?
* Let's say you filed an appeal and don't see it on this list. Is there anything here telling you what to do in that situation?
* You want to check if you need to upload further documentation for your first claim. How would you do that?

### Things to watch for:

- How do they navigate through the tool? 
- Do they see the right rail component at the bottom?

## Thank-You and Closing - 2 minutes

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on the site and make sure it really works for Veterans.

Great, well thank you so much again, and enjoy the rest of your day!
