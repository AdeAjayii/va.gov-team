## Why we're here

### North Star:
_Placeholder -  still drafting team North Star after Discovery Sprint completes_

### Product Suite (if applicable): 
Health Care - Veteran (person/consumer of health) Experience 

### Team Mission Statement:
_Placeholder - still drafting team North Star after Discovery Sprint completes_

### Product Portfolio:
Healthecare - Questionnaires/Intake forms

_List of products within your team's perview - make sure the list of products here aligns to what's captured in the [List of VA.gov Products doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hzz6whEGoQJQbiNvIggirhydYYdv57nfOZfLvFqZ1pQ/edit)_

### Responsibilities:
Our goal is to improve the in-person and online pre-appointment experiences for veterans, contribute to physical distancing efforts in VA facilities, and better integrate veteran-provided data in VA workflows by providing veterans with a digital option to complete pre-appointment questionnaires and screeners.

The problem: As a Veteran, I’m unable to easily and quickly provide pre and post visit documentation in a digital and discrete format that can be shared across facilities and my care team, so that they can save time before seeing a doctor.

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: _your team's labels_
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- User Testing unless PO/PM/UX agree to post sprint user feedback
- Design review including mockup/prototype with engineering if the interface is changed to ensure workflow and mockups/prototype are clearly understood.
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Team Norms
- Team Zoom Happy Hour - Monthly, Thursdays @3-4PM cst.
- Team crosses Central and Eastern Time zones so typical business/meeting hours are 9AM-4PM cst.
