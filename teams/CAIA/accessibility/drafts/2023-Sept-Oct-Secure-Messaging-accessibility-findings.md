# Accessibility Tools Utilized
`iOS VoiceOver` `MacOS VoiceOver` `JAWS`

## Coverage
This research fufilled X% (y/z) of its original request. Given the **limited/abundant** amount and **variety/lack of variety** of types of screen readers, a conclusive behavioral patterns **can/cannot** be determined locally in this study. We **can/cannot** draw future research considerations and document caught accessibility issues.

**Original study request: ##**

> xx participants should use a screenreader on a desktop or mobile device

## Participants
To best serve the users of VA.gov, we will need to collect the following information during each a11y research session:
- **Skill level of user:** Novice, Intermediate or Advanced
- **Operating System:** Mac or Windows
- **Assistive Technology being used:** Jaws, NVDA, Zoomtext, Dragon, etc.
- **Internet Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, etc.

**Participants who successfully completed sessions: 4**

**Examples below:**
- [1 desktop JAWS user (screen reader)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/2023-logged-in-user-interviews/session-notes/p2.md)
- [1 iOS VoiceOver user (screen reader)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/2023-logged-in-user-interviews/session-notes/p15.md)
- [1 desktop zoom text reader user (magnification, screen reader)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/information-architecture/research-and-analytics/2023-generative-logged-in-research/2023-logged-in-user-interviews/session-notes/p1.md)

## Key Findings
Add screenshots, images and videos here.

### Participants had trouble determining if there were attachments.
- In the inbox, attachments are noted by an icon (what looks to be a paper clip emoji) that comes after a message title. This icon isn't read aloud by screen readers.

### Finding 2
- Feel free to include bullets
- They can help add some more info

### Finding 3
- Feel free to include bullets
- They can help add some more info


## User Feedback

### Veterans' Voices: Impactful Quotes 
This section is for quotes. ⚠️ Participants should be referenced by number only, please.
In this section feel free to segment populations based on the trends we see with certain user types.

> "“Even though it is saved I don’t know where it is saved to.” - P1, on saving messages

> “I know there’s an emphasis on that, and we should be reminded of it as often as possible...We can’t hear it enough, to tell you the truth." - P3, on the Crisis Line message

> “This seems redundant. Category and subject could be seen as the same thing. I’m going to put the same thing (in the subject line).” - P3, on the "Category" and "subjects" inputs

> “When I go back to a message, normally it would say a file was attached and list the file name...It should tell you right there.” - P3, on reviewing a message for attachments

## a11y Recommendations
- Whether a message has attachments needs to be read aloud by assistive technology. The paper clip icon should come **before** the message title, not after, and have some accessible text that can be read aloud (think "Has attachment").
