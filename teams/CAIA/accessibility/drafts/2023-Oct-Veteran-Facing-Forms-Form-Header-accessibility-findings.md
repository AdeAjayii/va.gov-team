# Accessibility Tools Utilized
`ZoomText` `JAWs` `iOS-VO` `VoiceOver` `SR Microsoft Extension` `TalkBack` `Fusion` 

## Coverage
This research fufilled X% (y/z) of its original request. Given the **limited/abundant** amount and **variety/lack of variety** of types of screen readers, a conclusive behavioral patterns **can/cannot** be determined locally in this study. We **can/cannot** draw future research considerations and document caught accessibility issues.

**Original study request: ##**

> xx participants should use a screenreader on a desktop or mobile device
