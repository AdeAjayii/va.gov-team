# Accessibility Tools Utilized
`ZoomText` `JAWs` `iOS-VO` `VoiceOver` `SR Microsoft Extension` `TalkBack` `Fusion` 

## Coverage
This research fufilled `90`% (`9`/`10`) of its original request. Given the **limited/abundant** amount and **variety/lack of variety** of types of screen readers, a conclusive behavioral patterns **can/cannot** be determined locally in this study. We **can/cannot** draw future research considerations and document caught accessibility issues.

**Original study request:#**
> The purpose of this research was to explore the usability of a simplified form header design for Veterans - particularly those using screen readers

> `50` (`10`) [participants in this study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/blob/main/research/2023-09-form-header-usability-testing/research-plan.md#:~:text=Assistive%20Technology%20(AT)) should use a screenreader on a desktop or mobile device

> “Not sure how many pages I have left because it says 2 of 4, but I was on 2 of 4 already. Basically I have four pages, but I could be on 10 or 3. This would frustrate me. I think I am getting close to the end and these forms are tedious already. That would just annoy me more. I would be thinking I was thoroughly progressing but I am not.  I can't tell if I am in the beginning, middle or end, now. If I go back it will say 2 of 2.” - P10
