# [WIP] Accessibility landing page
The goal of this page is to provide a well-organized clearinghouse of information about the VA's accessibility practices. Our mission - to point VFS teams to the information, tools, and people they need to make VA.gov accessible.

The structure and content of this page is based on [CAIA's documentation content inventory](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YsMFmvgD4hEc93KTaTPJwvR5heHsCNgC3cwj53Eu3Ys/edit#gid=737007164) and [modeling exercise](https://airtable.com/app0xn5tf3PzkmRgN/tblRWeBHtjv1iaJbf/viwXbamm2X62BkHL5?blocks=hide).

# Accessibility on VA.gov
We strive to make VA.gov accessible beyond compliance. We strive to do more than pass a Section 508 audit - we integrate accessibility practices across research, design, and development disciplines, starting as early in the product cycle as possible.

## Strategy and standards
- Learn more about our [accessibility strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/modernized-va-gov-accessibility-strategy).
- Find out what [experience standards](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/va-gov-experience-standards) a VA.gov product needs to meet before it launches.
- The [accessibility defect severity rubric](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/accessibility-defect-severity-rubric) is our common language for determine the seriousness of an accessibility issue.

## Accessibility for product teams
(maybe we can adapt [this page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/expectations-per-discipline.md)? do we need to break out PMs?)

#### Collaboration Cycle
The Collaboration Cycle, managed by the **Governance**t team, is where teams who are building products/features on VA.gov get feedback and guidance on their product/feature to ensure it meets VA.gov experience standards for design, content, information architecture, quality assurance, accessibility, and research. Teams engage with the Collaboration Cycle throughout their product’s/feature’s lifecycle.
