# Accessibility on VA.gov
- We strive to make VA.gov accessible, beyond compliance.
- We aim to do more than pass a Section 508 audit.
- We integrate accessibility practices across research, design, and development disciplines, starting as early in the product cycle as possible.

## Strategy and standards
- Learn more about our [accessibility strategy](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/getting-started/modernized-va-gov-accessibility-strategy).
- Find out what [experience standards](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/va-gov-experience-standards) a VA.gov product needs to meet before it launches.
- The [accessibility defect severity rubric](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/accessibility-defect-severity-rubric) is our common language for determining the seriousness of an accessibility issue.

## Accessibility by discipline
All of us are responsible for the accessibility of our products. And every discipline has a role:

## Get help from accessibility specialists

**There are two routes to access support from accessibility specialists.**
### Route 1: Collaboration Cycle
Teams **creating new features or products** are required to go through the Collaboration Cycle, which includes accessibility reviews. The Collaboration Cycle is managed by the Governance team.
<details><summary>Learn about the Collaboration Cycle</summary>


 <br>The Collaboration Cycle, managed by the **Platform Governance** team, is where teams who are building products/features on VA.gov get feedback and guidance on their product/feature to ensure it meets VA.gov experience standards for design, content, information architecture, quality assurance, accessibility, and research. 
 
Teams engage with the Collaboration Cycle throughout their product‚Äôs/feature‚Äôs lifecycle via three separate touchpoint meetings (Design Intent, Midpoint Review and Staging).

[Learn how the Collaboration Cycle works](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/), and [contact the Governance team](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/contact-us) with your questions.

### Route 2: General accessiblity support
Teams **at any point in the product/feature lifecycle** can get general accessibility support from the Sitewide Content, Accessibility, and Information Architecture (CAIA) team. They can also reach out to specialists on Slack.

‚ö†Ô∏è**Note**: Any ticket(s) given, on either route, will drive your team towards a more accessible product.
