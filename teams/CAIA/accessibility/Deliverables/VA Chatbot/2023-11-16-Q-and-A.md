    - Question: Is the keyboard user expected to hit tab to remove the focus? What parts of our bot does this apply to?

    - Question: We have been able to navigate to both buttons by hitting enter after navigating to the adaptive card in the chat history. How would you expect to navigate to these buttons?

    - Question: What is the expected behavior for this?


- Answer
    - Contextual links:
            - Note that both of these links are more focused on *why* and *when* to manage focus, whereas this question is more about how focus is changed by the user
            - [Focus & Keyboard Operability](https://usability.yale.edu/web-accessibility/articles/focus-keyboard-operability)
            - [When to manage focus in an accessible way](https://adhoc.team/2021/09/09/when-to-manage-focus-in-an-accessible-way/)
    - In most browsers, people can move focus by pressing the `Tab` key and the `Shift` + `Tab` keys. This is the expected paradigm for how to shift focus to different elements of a page from the keyboard across VA.gov. It is an *assumed* norm, though. I am working to see if there is any stronger guidance than this assumption, though. This response will be updated to reflect as necessary.
