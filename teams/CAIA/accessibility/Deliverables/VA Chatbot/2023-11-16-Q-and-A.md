    - Issue: When following the instructions to press Enter to focus on a link, the keyboard focus gets trapped on that link. The only way to remove focus is with the Esc key.
    - Question: Is the keyboard user expected to hit tab to remove the focus? What parts of our bot does this apply to?

    - Issue: A situation where, after triggering the prescription flow with the refill keyword, and then selecting to track shipments a keyboard-only user is prevented from selecting the response buttons, more details and other items in package.
    - Question: We have been able to navigate to both buttons by hitting enter after navigating to the adaptive card in the chat history. How would you expect to navigate to these buttons?

    - Issue: Hitting shift+tab triggers the keyboard help modal, after dismissing the modal, hitting shift+tab retriggers the modal, preventing users from ever navigating past a certain point.
    - Question: What is the expected behavior for this?
