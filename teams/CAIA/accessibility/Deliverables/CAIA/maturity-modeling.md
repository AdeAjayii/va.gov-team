`[WIP]`

[Per a request from Martha Wilkes request to produce a maturity model to gauge teams' accessibility practices](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/56240).

This work aims to produce a tool that helps to prioritize which teams need support at what point in the design and development lifecycle (this could be within, or external from the Collab cycle), and provide teams with a roadmap on how to "level-up" their internal accessibility practice. 

A few key considerations: 

- tool should prioritize helping teams over rating products
- tool isn't meant to be punitive, but to provide a useful way for teams to identify their processes, and as a way for support groups like CAIA to quickly understand a team's approach to accessibility
