`[WIP]`

[Per a request from Martha Wilkes request to produce a maturity model to gauge teams' accessibility practices](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/56240).

This work aims to produce a tool that helps to, 

- prioritize what teams need support at what point in the design and development lifecycle (this could be within, or external from the Collab cycle)
    - as an added benefit, provide teams with a roadmap on how to "level up" their internal accessibility practice
