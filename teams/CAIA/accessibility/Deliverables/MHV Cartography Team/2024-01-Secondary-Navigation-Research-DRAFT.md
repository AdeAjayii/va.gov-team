# Accessibility Tools Utilized
`iOS-VO`, ...

## Coverage
This research fufilled X% (y/z) of its original request. Given the **limited/abundant** amount and **variety/lack of variety** of types of screen readers, a conclusive behavioral patterns **can/cannot** be determined locally in this study. We **can/cannot** draw future research considerations and document caught accessibility issues.

**Original study request: ##**

> xx participants should use a screenreader on a desktop or mobile device

## Key Findings
Add screenshots, images and videos here.

### Finding 1: Prototype B's non-collapsed menu options were easier to navigate
- Mobile user felt that having the menu options open by default (Prototype B), rather than behind a dropdown/hidden menu (Prototype A), was easier for him to use.

> “You have to click it to find out what’s in the menu. With icons, you don’t have to click, you can just go to the icon if you know where the icon is.” - P10

### Finding 2: Prototype B's lack of a "Home" option was confusing
- Desktop user was able to figure out that "MyHealtheVet" would take them to the home page, but only because a) of its location and b) her familiarity with the app.
- She was able to navigate to Prototype A's "Home" much more quickly.

> "When I landed on the title as MyHealtheVet, I wondered if it was the same as Home. I assumed it was because it’s in the same spot...I’m in MyHealtheVet so why would I click on MyHealtheVet? Did I leave [the app]?" - P11

### Finding 3: Locating medical supplies order form - and any items that aren't in the top nav - was confusing
- Users didn't know what options were available to them if they weren't listed in the top navigation. P11 assumed that there would be more on the Home page, but only because of her familiarity with the app.

> "Was frustrating that Payments wasn’t one of those [navigation] choices. I’d expect it up here, or to be grouped into a dropdown menu if possible. Because the [four nav items] seemed like my only choices. There’s no place for “Other” up there." - P11

- P10 expected this to be available to him in the top navigation. He went through the navigation items and couldn't find it there; he wasn't able to find it until the facilitator directed him to the Home page.

> "I didn’t know there was a section for medical supplies." - P10

- P11 assumed it would be under "Meds," and wasn't sure where to find it otherwise:

> "I’m hoping and praying it would be under ‘Meds’! Because I think that would make sense, even though it’s not a medication, it’s a medical supply." _Where else would you look for it?_ "That's a good question...if I didn’t know and it was afterhours, when I couldn’t call VA to ask, I would probably send a secure message to my primary care doctor." - P11

 
### Finding 4: Entering MyHealtheVet directly into the "X-ray results" secure message was disorienting, but welcome
- P10 assumed that "X-ray results" was the home page, and didn't realize that it wasn't for a bit.

> "A lot of times, when you sign in to something, even VA.gov, it takes you to [the] actual home page. That’s why I said home page, even though this prototype, now that you mention it, might not be the home page." - P10

- Users liked this! They thought it was a welcome change that would save them steps.
> "So where it takes you to after sign in isn’t the home page? And ‘home - dashboard’ is the official ‘home page’? I like it!" - P10
> "If [medical records] really comes up this way, this would be amazing!" - P11

### Finding 5: Screen reader pronounciations lead to hesitation
- In Prototype B, P10's screen reader pronounced "Appts" as "apps," which he needed us to clarify.

> "I take it that’s short for appointments? It sounded like the screen reader was saying ‘apps’."

- In both prototypes, P11's screen reader didn't pronounce "MyHealtheVet" correctly. P11 noted this and wondered if it could be corrected.
