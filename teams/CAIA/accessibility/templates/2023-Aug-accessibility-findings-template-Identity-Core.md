# Accessibility Tools Utilized
`iOS-VO` (List types of AT covered here)

## Coverage
This research fulfilled X% (y/z) of its original request. Given the **limited/abundant** amount and **variety/lack of variety** of types of screen readers, a conclusive behavioral patterns **can/cannot** be determined locally in this study. We **can/cannot** draw future research considerations and document caught accessibility issues.

**Original study request: ##**

> xx participants should use a screenreader on a desktop or mobile device

## Participants
To best serve the users of VA.gov, we will need to collect the following information during each a11y research session:
- **Skill level of user:** Novice, Intermediate or Advanced
- **Operating System:** Mac or Windows
- **Assistive Technology being used:** Jaws, NVDA, ZoomText, Dragon, etc.
- **Internet Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, etc.
- **Note**: In the table below, the first row is an example of P54

## Initial Notes
### P12
- Rarely uses AT on desktop; uses it all the time on iOS. 
- Usually selects everything on the page and lets VoiceOver read it back to him.
- Prefers iOS devices because they are "convenient while I'm on the go."
- When using MyHealtheVet on iOS, he uses a combination of pre-fill and facial recognition to access the app. "I selected that option; that's convenient for me."
- If he'd had access to AT he was comfortable with on Windows, he would've used it to read the contents of page accordions out loud. "I'd rather just hear it read to me."
