# CAIA: Accessibility
## Our goal
Our goal is to empower teams to deliver the most accessible products possible for Veterans. We do this by providing teams with insights, training, and support as accessibility SMEs.

## How CAIA can help your team with accessibility

The Content, Accessibility and Information Architecture team, or CAIA, is a cross-functional team of folks here to help your team deliver the highest quality product possible to Veterans. 

This document explains some of the ways that CAIA can help your team with accessibility.

We've grouped our offerings by how they relate to the touch point meetings in the Collaboration Cycle. We've done this because the Collaboration Cycle is a well-known process for our community, and maps well to how we do work. 

Note that CAIA can support teams going through the Collaboration Cycle, but **CAIA is not involved in the Collaboration Cycle directly**. We are here to help you launch the best products possible, we're not gatekeepers. If we find and flag an issue we can't and won't block you from launching. Teams going through the Collaboration Cycle can work with us, as can teams working outside of it.

## Services we offer

What follows is a menu of the services we offer. Feel free to fire up an intake ticket, or contact us directly on Slack using the `#accessibility-help` or the `#sitewide-content-accessibility-ia` channels on DSVA if there is anything we can do with you and your team.

### Research support
We can help you plan your research sessions, ensuring that they are equitable and accounting for important accessibility factors. When it comes to running research sessions, we can also provide technical support for research participants who rely on assistive tech, like screen readers. 

### Accessibility test planning
We can work with a team to develop and accessibility-focused testing plan so that during design and development you are able to continually ensure that your product is accessible. We can help develop the plan, and walk you through how to run the tests. We have experience creating both automated and manual test plans.

### Support design discovery
We can work with you and your team during design discovery to ensure that accessibility considerations are being taken into account, and help to flag when something may be veering away from the accessible happy path.

### Review wireframes and prototypes
We can review your static wireframes or interactive prototypes looking for potential accessibility issues. We can also work with you and advise on how to annotate designs to ensure that they are easy to implement in an accessible way.

### PDF audit
We can review PDFs documents for accessibility, and help advise on how to remediate any issues found.

### Staging audit
We can review products in staging, testing with assistive technology, reviewing for accessibility best practices, and ensuring that the product meets OCTO-DE accessibility experience standards.

### Health check audit
This is very much like a staging review, but done in production.


### Training and education
We can provide training and resources for you and your team on accessibility best practices and methodologies. 

### Spot checks, general support
We are always here for more general, off-the-cuff support, too! Never hesitate to reach out to use on the DSVA slack, either in the `#accessibility-help` or the `#sitewide-content-accessibility-ia` channels.
