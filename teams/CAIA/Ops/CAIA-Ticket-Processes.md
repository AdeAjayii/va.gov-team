### Ticket
A method to track a work requirement. In Github they are used to track issues at the repository level. Tickets contain the details of the issue and the steps or work required to meet the definition of done.

### Issue
An issue is a discreet, well defined unit of work for a team or project. In Github, they are synonymous with tickets - that is, a ticket will usually contain a single well defined issue. With VA, however, tickets can contain more than one issue, and so the best way to think of it is that a ticket is a ‘bucket’ or ‘repository’ for issues.

### EPIC
An overarching grouping of tasks (or sub-tasks) that contain several smaller `Issues`, also known as `User Stories`.

### Task
In Github, a task is an individual work item, usually assignable to someone, who will then complete that item and check it off. 

### Repository
A place where a project’s files, version history, and resources live. In CAIA, we operate in the VA.gov-team repository.

### Pipeline
A pipeline is a collection or series of workflows that defines the status of work being done at a given point in the work process. The CAIA Pipeline consists of distinct stages that help define the status of work while it is with our team. The start point for our pipeline is `New Stuff` and the end point is `Closed`.

### Refinement
The process of reviewing and assessing tickets in the various stages of the CAIA pipeline - Ready, Backlog etc - in an effort to progress them through the pipeline to a closed status. Includes the following:
- **Reviewing & assessing raw tickets** as they come into the `New Stuff` column.
- **Reviewing and assessing tickets in the backlog** to ensure they do not get forgotten and seeing if they can be pulled into the current `Ready` or `In Progress` work streams.
- **Reviewing and assessing tickets in “Blocked”** to see if they can be unblocked or if not, who needs to be notified or informed to get it unblocked.

## Ticket Creation
1. [CAIA Intake Request Ticket](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/new?assignees=strelichl%2C+coforma-terry&labels=sitewide+CAIA%2C+sitewide+content-product+support&projects=&template=sitewide-content-intake-form.md&title=%3CType+of+Request%3E+from+%3CTeam%3E) is filled out by VFS team. 
2. Ticket automatically assigns `Terry` and `Lily` and adds the `sitewide CAIA`label.
3. This label triggers GitHub Projects to pull the ticket into CAIA's view, and adds it to the `New Stuff` [lane on the main board](https://github.com/orgs/department-of-veterans-affairs/projects/929/views/1).
    - **Default assignees:** Terry, Lily
    - **Default Labels:** Sitewide CAIA
    - **Note:** A ticket must have the `sitewide CAIA` label to exist in GH Projects!
