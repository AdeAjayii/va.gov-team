# Overview
## What is the purpose of this document?
This document is designed to serve as a guide for how the Centralized Content, Accessibility, and Information Architecture Team conducts and organizes kickoff meetings with VFS teams and also serves as a source of information for teams on what to expext during this process. Ultimately the purpose opf the document is to make the kickoff process with CAIA a little clearer.

## Why does my team need a kickoff meeting?
After submitting an intake request form with CAIA is often a really good idea for our team to meet with yours to get a better understanding of how we can work together and collaborate most effectively. It also gives us an opportunity to ask any questions or clarify any details. And sometimes this information is a little hard to discern from an intake alone.

## How can I schedule a kickoff meeting with CAIA?
After you have submitted your intake ticket, reach out to us in our [DSVA Slack chanel](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C01K37HRUAH) and we can set something up. CAIA will create the meeting but leave it open for you to add whoever you need to from your team.

Please also note that due to the volume of teams we work with, please aloow at least a week for us to get prepped for our meeting.

## When are the CAIA kickoff meetings?
The CAIA Team have a regular weekly slot for teams to schedule a kickoff with CAIA on Wednesdays at 12PM ET, for 2 30 minutes slots.
Once a kickoff meeting has been scheduled we will share it on the CAIA shared calendar, the link for which is below:<br>

## What do I need to do to prepare for our kickoff with CAIA?
Reading through this document is a great start, particularly the section the explains what it is that CAIA actually does. Then, the following checklist is useful:

- Have I invited everyone on my team who needs to be on the kickoff?
- Do I have links to all my product/project artifacts such as Mural/Sketch files etc

## How we collaborate with your team

If your team has dedicated content, IA, or accessibility experts, we’ll support their work. If you don’t have dedicated experts in these areas, we’ll collaborate with your designers, researchers, and other team members.
If you’re going through the VA.gov Collaboration Cycle, we can help you prepare for your touchpoints with the Platform Governance team and make changes based on their feedback. 
<br>

### Content 

What we do
Collaborate with VFS teams on content for all Veteran-facing products on VA.gov
Create, maintain, and update all unauthenticated static pages in the benefit hubs and resources and support section of VA.gov 
Manage the translation of content into Spanish and Tagalog
Maintain the VA.gov content style guide and help align content across the VA.gov ecosystem with the VA content standards
<br>

### Information Architecture

Teams are rightfully focused on designing and releasing their specific thing, but they often don’t have time or context to dig into the broad IA implications for their new or changed product. 
CAIA IA makes sure that Veterans and family can find the products, and that the overall IA of the site directs them to their top needs. When a new product launches, we help with the following:<br>
- User journey, entry points, and important relationships: What triggers a veteran/user needing this product, and how will they know it exists and find it? <br>
- What areas on the site will link to this product? What other products or pages should crosslink to this product?<br>
- Page placement: where will the page live in our va.gov sitemap and why?<br>
- URLs and Breadcrumbs: what should the URL be and why?<br>
- Redirects: is this product replacing a page that we need to redirect? <br>
Note that if we are redirecting content or tools from legacy pages (eBenefits, the ‘old’ VA websites), a lot of stakeholder coordination is needed with those folks. Connect with those stakeholders early!
- Best Bets: If you go to va.gov/search and type in ‘pension’, you’ll see 2 results under “our top recommendations”.  We can help set up which URLS appear under top recs for different keywords, helping your page be more findable in search results.<br>
<br>

### How CAIA can help your team with accessibility

<details><summary>Toggle to view additional details about this section</summary>
The Content, Accessibility, and Information Architecture team, or CAIA, is a cross-functional team of folks here to help your team deliver the highest quality product possible to Veterans.<br>
  
Below you will find some of the ways that CAIA can help your team with accessibility.<br>
How we relate to the Collaboration Cycle<br>

We've grouped our offerings by how they relate to the touch point meetings in the Collaboration Cycle. We've done this because the Collaboration Cycle is a well-known process for our community, and maps well to how we do work.<br>
Note that CAIA can assist teams going through the Collaboration Cycle, but CAIA is not involved in the Collaboration Cycle directly. We are here to help you launch the best products possible, we're not gatekeepers. If we find and flag an issue we can't and won't block you from launching. Teams going through the Collaboration Cycle can work with us, as can teams working outside of it.<br>

### Services we offer
  
What follows is a menu of the services we offer. No worries if you don't know what exactly you need, though, feel free to contact us on the DSVA Slack using the #accessibility-help or the #sitewide-content-accessibility-ia channels.
You can also reach us by attending our weekly office hours on Tuesdays at 4 PM Eastern on Zoom.<br>
### Research support

We can help you plan your research sessions, ensuring that they are equitable and account for important accessibility factors. When it comes time to run research sessions we can also provide technical support for research participants who rely on assistive technology, like screen readers. During the research sessions, we also observe and take notes, with an eye to accessibility. Once the research has concluded, we provide a robust deliverable containing accessibility findings and recommendations to the research team.<br>
### Accessibility test planning

We can work with a team to develop an accessibility-focused testing plan so that during design and development you are able to continually ensure that your product is accessible. We can help develop the plan, and walk you through how to run the tests. We have experience creating plans for both automated and manual testing.<br>
### Support design discovery

We can work with you and your team during design discovery to ensure that accessibility considerations are being taken into account, and help to flag when something may be veering away from the accessible happy path.<br>
### Review wireframes and prototypes

We can review your static wireframes or interactive prototypes looking for potential accessibility issues. We can also work with you and advise on how to annotate designs to ensure that they are easy to implement in an accessible way.<br>
### PDF audit

We can review PDF documents for accessibility, and help advise on how to remediate any issues found.
Staging audit
We can review products in staging, testing with assistive technology, reviewing for accessibility best practices, and ensuring that the product meets OCTO-DE accessibility experience standards.
We can also help you prepare the required accessibility testing artifact for the Collaboration Cycle.<br>
### Health check audit

This is very much like a staging review but done in production! This is useful for older products that were implemented and released before certain standards were put into place.
Training and education
We can provide training and resources for you and your team on accessibility best practices and methodologies above and beyond what Governance offers at onboarding. Also, don't miss the accessibility champs program!
Spot checks, general guidance
We are always here for more general, off-the-cuff questions! Never hesitate to reach out to us on the DSVA Slack in either the #accessibility-help or the #sitewide-content-accessibility-ia channels.
