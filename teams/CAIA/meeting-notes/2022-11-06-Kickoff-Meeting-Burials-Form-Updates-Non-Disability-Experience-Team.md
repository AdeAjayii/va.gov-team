## Discussion Notes‚úçÔ∏è

Describe what you need in a few sentences:

We would like CAIA to review the critical updates we are making to the 530EZ burial form, so it can be successfully processed.

We ask that the scope of CAIA's review be limited to the form pages we are touching, so we can quickly release a working MVP version of the updated form. Future work will focus on taking a more comprehensive look at the form to determine additional enhancements, replace depreciated design components, and address accessibility issues.

We intend to fix defect-0 and defect-1 level A11y errors, but we would like to limit those fixes to the pages we are touching with these field updates.
The current online form is missing critical fields that were added to the paper form over the last 2 years. These missing fields are causing significant processing delays and putting additional burden on Veterans.

The changes include adding missing fields and removing depreciated fields.

Fixing the 530 form is a high-priority for OCTO and the VBA.
