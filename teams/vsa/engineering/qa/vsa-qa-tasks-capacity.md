# VSA-QA Capacity & Tasks

Currently, with only one VSA-QA resource shared across all VSA Product Teams, capacity limitations preclude VSA-QA from handling all the QA tasks outlined by VSP.

## Who should read this?

- Product Managers
- Front-end engineers

## Testing-types & assignments/deputizations

The matrix below illustrates the current reality of what VSA-QA can realistically perform, and what VSA Product Teams are unavoidability "deputized" to perform themselves:

| QA Task | VSA-QA\* | VSA Product Teams |
| ------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| [Manual testing](vsa-qa-process.md) [for VSP Staging Reviews] | :heavy_check_mark: | |
| Unit testing | | :heavy_check_mark: |
| [E2E testing](vsa-qa-e2e-testing.md) (incl. [Regression](vsa-qa-regression.md)) | | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Load testing | | :heavy_check_mark: |

This matrix will be updated if/when VSA-QA staffing increases.

## QA Shift-Left initiatives

Although earlier QA-involvment during Design & Build phases currently have to be lower-priority, you're encouraged to include me for the following development aspects:

- Design Intent -- invite VSA-QA\* as Optional to your DI meetings w/ VSP
- E2E tests -- ping VSA-QA\* for advice and/or hands-on help

VSA-QA will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate your requests, as Manual-testing commitments permit.

\* Right now it's just @tlei123.  When/if VSA-QA receives more resources, a #vsa-qa slack-channel will be created on DSVA-Slack.
