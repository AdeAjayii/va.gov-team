# VSA-QA Regression Testing

Regression test-plans and test-cases are QA artifacts expected by VSP for QA practice-area review, as part of their [Usability Testing Prep](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle/vsp-collaboration-cycle.md#usability-testing-prep) collaboration-cycle checkpoint.  \[See [VSP Collaboration Cycle](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/working-with-vsp/vsp-collaboration-cycle/vsp-collaboration-cycle.md)]

While current capacity limitations preclude direct involvement by VSA-QA in Regression Testing, here are some basic points for VSA Product Teams to consider while being "deputized" for regression testing:

- Basically, regression testing means testing the **existing** parts of your Product/Feature, to ensure that your new changes won't break them. For better understading of regression testing, see [this Medium article](https://medium.com/edureka/regression-testing-b913b7064824#:~:text=of%20Regression%20Testing-,What%20is%20Regression%20Testing%3F,made%20is%20called%20Regression%20Testing.%E2%80%9D).

- For Usability Testing Prep, draft regression test-plans & test-cases are acceptible for VSP review/feedback.  The idea is to show that the Team at least has regression testing in mind, regardless of actual Team/QA capacity limitations.

- Product Teams have already been doing regression testing -- it just hasn't been formally called regression:
    - For front-end, regression testing is already part of existing E2E-testing;
    - For back-end, regression testing is already part of existing API load-testing.
