# TestRail Projects

**[WORK IN PROGRESS]**

## What is a Project?

A Project is TestRail's main organizational unit.  All data like Test Cases, Test Runs, and Test Plans are directly associated with a Project.

## How are Projects used for VSA?

Projects are used to reflect VSA Product Teams organization -- each Product Team has its own Project.  All test-data for a Team's products/features are housed inside the Team's Project.  Typically, you can only access your own Team's Project with your Team's login credentials.
