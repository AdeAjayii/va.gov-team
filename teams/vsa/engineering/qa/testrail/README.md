## Brand-new to TestRail?

### Platform's basic documentation

If you're brand-new to TestRail, be sure to read [VSP's basic documentation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/ca2514e624dcf5b245cf662f17839c6c5cee69f0/platform/quality-assurance/testrail/README.md) first!  The VSA-specific documentation here _supplements_ that documentation, and assumes you have some basic TestRail knowledge.

#### Existing VSA Teams

Existing VSA teams already have TestRail access (ask your Product Manager) and a team-specific TestRail Project.  Unless your VSA Team's brand-new, you can skip VSP's Getting Started topics for requesting access and creating a project.

### VSA-specific TestRail help

To go beyond the basics and use TestRail better for your VSA products/features, read about specific topics below.  Each topic also provides a link to VSP's corresponding basic doc(s).
