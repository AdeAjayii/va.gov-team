# Background
In order to assess the pain points that VSA engineers encounter when communicating with VSP we interviewed all engineers on the VSA program to gather feedback. This feedback was organized and insights pulled from it, here are those insights.

## Areas of communication
There are two main areas of communication for VSA engineers; long term communication and daily communication. Each of these two areas are broken down below.

### Long term communication
This is communication around longer term efforts by VSP, such as fixes to the build system, or large initiatives such as the Expirimental Design System. The major gaps in this long term communication fit into two categories; communcation at the beginning of the initiative and communication during or near the the end of the initiative -

#### At the beginning of the initiative 
1. There is not enough communication before a large initiative is undertaken where VSP defines a clear problem statement then involves VSA in the selection of a solution. This leads to solutions that solve a symptom of a problem, not the root problem itself.
2. There is not enough research done involving VSA engineers where they are asked about the nature of the problem or the nature of the potential solutions. This results in critical context being missed by VSP and ultimately a suboptimal solution.

#### During the initiative or near the end
1. There is not enough transparancy provided during the building of a potential solution for these larger initiatives so VSA engineers do not have an understanding of where these large initiatives are in their build process.
2. VSA engineers are not consulted on the release of a larger initiative and the current communication generally takes place over Slack and it missed. This causes major time losses and a critical loss of trust in the platform.
