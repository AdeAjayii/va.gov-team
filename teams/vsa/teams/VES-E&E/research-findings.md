Research Goals
--------------

The E&E portfolio team aims to understand:

-   How Veterans determine eligibility and enroll in VA health services and benefits
-   What differences exist between application processes (paper vs. digital)
-   Veteran pain points related to eligibility and enrollment

Research questions
------------------

This research will help us understand:

-   How Veterans navigate the current eligibility and enrollment processes for health benefits
-   What touchpoints Veterans have with the VAMC and HEC and their staff
-   Pain points relating to eligibility and enrollment
-   What systems and processes might support Veterans in receiving the health benefits they've earned - and how the VA's current E&E architecture supports (or fails to support) their efforts

Methodology
-----------

We conducted sixteen 1:1 semi-structured remote moderated research sessions via Zoom between September 12 - 16, 2022. Fifteen of those interviews were with Veterans, and one was with the family member of a Veteran.

Our team asked open-ended questions to encourage participants to share their story.

Hypotheses and Conclusions
--------------------------

These were our hypotheses at the beginning of this research effort:

-   Veterans find that the overall benefits landscape is overwhelming and confusing.
-   It's hard to find benefit information that applies specifically to them.
-   Determining personal eligibility is difficult and the processes are unclear.
-   The difficulty of getting required documentation for eligibility applications provides a significant barrier to seeking benefits.
-   Entering the same information multiple times is frustrating for Veterans.
-   Processes for review and approval lack transparency.
-   Communication between VA staff and Veterans is often delayed, unclear, unhelpful, or distributed in multiple places.
-   Eligibility and enrollment wait times and delays cause some Veterans to abandon the application process.
-   The current eligibility and enrollment process is not accessible for some Veterans.
-   It can be difficult for a Veteran's caretaker to gain access to help with the E&E process.

Due to the high number of hypotheses and the short timeline of this research effort, we were not able to conclusively prove and disprove each one. There are early signals that could support some of these hypotheses, but more exploration is needed.

Our research roadmap addresses specific gaps for further exploration:  

-   Additional research for Veterans that have lower disability ratings
-   Portfolio research practice ecosystem research

You can find the roadmap under Next Steps.

Key Findings
------------

1.  Veterans' experiences with enrollment vary by benefit.
2.  Veterans get the majority of benefit information from non-VA resources.
3.  Veterans who separated more recently receive more benefits information from the VA.
4.  Veterans do not recognize eligibility and enrollment as separate processes.

Details of Findings
-------------------

### 1\. Veterans' experiences with enrollment vary by benefit.

Veterans struggled with the process of obtaining disability and healthcare benefits. With a more complex eligibility and enrollment process, the administrative burden was very high unless the Veteran worked with a Veteran Service Organization or Officer (VSO) for increased support.

Veterans had a much more positive experience in enrolling in the VA home loan and education benefit programs. In these programs, less complexity and increased support lead to a lower administrative burden and a better experience.

*"I don't have negative things to say about the education enrollment and benefits acquisition process."*

*-Participant 19*

*"Health stuff . . . like a new claim that I believe to be service connected I will always go to a VSO and I will always . . . advise others to go to a VSO too."*

*-Participant 19*

### 2\. Veterans get the majority of benefit information from non-VA resources.

73% of the participants we spoke to mentioned getting benefit information from other Veterans, either in person or online.

66% of participants worked with a VSO.

### 3\. Veterans who separated more recently receive more benefits information from the VA.

Veterans who had separated from the military more recently were more likely to cite the VA or the separation process as a source of benefit information.This didn't replace other sources of information; Veterans who had separated more recently reported getting benefit information from more sources.

Additionally, Veterans who separated more recently enrolled in healthcare benefits much closer to the time of their separation. The Veterans that we spoke to who separated between 1970 and 1999 took an average of about 25 years to enroll in healthcare; for Veterans who separated between 2000 and 2022 the average was less than 1 year. We would need more research to learn about the causes of the shorter timeline.

Veterans had widely varying experiences with the separation process, which is a key moment in establishing their relationship with the VA.

Communication about benefits seems to have improved over time, but still has a ways to go.

*"Back then it wasn't that much; it was a talk to you and go -- compared to what I hear they do today."*     

*-Participant 22, separated in the 1980s, describing his separation experience*

*"Useful as a screen door in a spaceship."*

*-Participant 4, separated in 2018, describing her TAPs class experience*

*"Make sure that they go to TAP twice and try to get into an in-person one. Because the Zoom ones, you don't get the information out of it."*

*-Veteran participant in VEO Transition Project Research*

### 4\. Veterans do not recognize eligibility and enrollment as separate processes.

Veterans describe their primary challenges as Awareness and Enrollment, and mention Eligibility infrequently.

We recommend doing further research on this topic because our study happened to have a very large percentage of participants with a high disability rating, which generally simplifies eligibility. We hypothesize that Veterans with lower ratings, or without a rating, will have a more difficult time determining which benefits apply to them.

Recommendations
---------------

Investing in strategies and processes will lead to a mature portfolio level research practice that connects research insights to product prioritization.

How we will get there: 

-   Research roadmap and backlog
    -   Roadmap gives broad overview of future research needs and general priority
    -   Backlog includes tactical plans about hypotheses, additional research questions, research methods, and timelines
-   Research prioritization framework
-   Portfolio level research practice

Next Steps
----------

We plan to explore our starting hypotheses in more detail through the below research roadmap.

### Now: Phase 1 (July-September)

**Veteran Eligibility and Enrollment Experience**

What are the pain points of determining e&e for Veterans? 

### Next: Phase 2 (Q4 2022)

**Portfolio Practice Research**

How could a portfolio practice research team best work within the existing research structure at VA?

**Validate Veteran Findings**

What are the enrollment and eligibility pain points for Veterans with lower disability ratings? 

### Later: Phase 3 (2023)

**Service Transition Preparation**

How might we increase visibility of VA benefits for transitioning service members? Why is there such a wide gap between end of service and enrolled in benefits between older and younger Veterans?

**Caregiver & Family Member Eligibility and Enrollment Experience**

What are the pain points of determining e&e on behalf of a Veteran and for themselves?

**Veteran Service Organizations**

How do VSOs provide support to Veterans during the e&e process? How do they help determine eligibility?

**Non-VA Veteran Motivations and Attitudes**

Why do Veterans not enroll in VA benefits? How might we increase visibility for Veterans who are not engaged?
