<p>
   
#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Every day @ 11am Eastern
- 30 min
- 3 Question Format: What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Any impediments?

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- 1st Monday of every sprint week @ 3pm ET
- 1 hour


#### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and generate action items.

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 11:30ET
- 30 min

#### Grooming
Create, review, estimate, and prioritize backlog items.

#### Issue Etiquette
Anyone on the team can create a user story. All our responsible for keeping them up to date.

- For an issue to go into the **"Ready"** column, it must have the following:
   - Estimate
   - Title that explains task
   - Description or user story with background, goal and acceptance criteria
   - Labels: _vsa-caregivers_ and what category it falls into (backend, front-end, research, design, product)
   - Nested in an Epic

- For an issue to be in **"Validate,"** all work related to the ticket is implemented, and it is accessible in staging and ready to ship to production, as defined by the acceptance criteria.

- For an issue to be **"Done,"** Validation has occured, and each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. 

- If there is are new work requests or sudden changes, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Estimation
We use fibonacci numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to account for the level of effort, complexity, and amount of unknowns in our work. Here is our guide:
| Number | Meaning |
| -------| --------|
| 0  | I know exactly what needs to be done, and I don't need to change any code.
| 1  | I know exactly what needs to be done, and it involves changing a tiny bit of code.
| 2  | I'm pretty sure I know what needs to be done, it's a bit complex, and it will involve creating/updating tests.
| 3  | I have a good idea what needs to be done, but it's fairly complex, and there could be some unknowns.
| 5  | I know what needs to be done at a high level, but is significant complexity, and there are some large unknowns.
| 8  | I understand the concept and the goals, but there is high complexity and critical unknowns.
| 13 | There are too many unknowns, and we'll need to break this down into smaller chunks.

#### User story validation
- All team members are responsible for validation, but different team members will specialize in different areas.
- For anything considered a "release" or significant change, Tze (the VSA QA lead) will be responsible for QA
- Engineers will be responsible for ensuring and documenting in the ticket that all acceptance criteria are met
- Design is responsible for ensuring that design and content specifications are met
- PM and PO will be responsible for end-to-end QA and communication to stakeholders


## Team Norms
- We are iterate often and deliver frequently
- We are respectful, both online and off
- We turn on cameras as often as possible at meetings / calls
- We are flexible and intentional in the way we work
- We communicate often and in public channels
- We ask questions when they arise
- We listen without judgement
- We keep our work simple and clean
- We validate each others' work
- We do reviews in independent environments
- We hold each other accountable
- We stick to our commitments as best as possible
- We are respectful of others' time


#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. All work is documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
