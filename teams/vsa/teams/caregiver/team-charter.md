## Guideposts

### Team Mission Statement:
To provide the ability for Veteran and Veteran caregivers to complete and submit VA Form 10-10CG electronically, which will directly feed into electronic processing by VA and allow applicants to track online status updates.

### Team Vision:
Build an online experience that allows caregivers to easily apply for, track, and manage benefits.

### Team North Star:
Reduce the amount of time it takes a Caregiver application to be processed
Increase the number of online applications

## What we work on:

### Product Suite (if applicable): 
Health Products 

### Product Portfolio:

### Responsibilities (Problem space and user goals):
1) Caregivers play an important role in the health and well-being of veterans. Tens of thousands of family caregivers across the country provide daily assistance to wounded veterans

## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Every other day @ 1:30pm Eastern
- 15 min
- 3 Question Format: What I did yesterday? What will I do today? Any impediments?

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 10am ET
- 1 hour


#### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and any action items

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 1:45ET
- 30 min

#### Grooming
Assess and update workload for remainder of sprint

- 2nd Thursday of every sprint, after Standup
- 1 hour

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Current Sprint column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: _vsa-caregivers_
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Team Norms

_Update as you see fit! These are some starter norms for you to consider_

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face (Webcam) at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- Let’s have fun and do great work!

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. Every body of work should be documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
