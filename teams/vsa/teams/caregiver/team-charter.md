## How we work

<details><summary>Workflow and Cadence</summary>
<p>
   
#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Every day @ 11am Eastern
- 30 min
- 3 Question Format: What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Any impediments?
- We use the daily Slack thread to share any links, questions, and notes that come up

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- 1st Monday of every sprint week @ 3pm ET
- 1 hour
- We'll use Github milestones to commit to what's in each sprint


#### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and generate action items.

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 11:30ET
- 30 min

#### Grooming
Create, review, estimate, and prioritize backlog items.

- 2nd Wednesday of every sprint, 10:00am
- 1 hour

</p>

#### Issue Etiquette
Anyone on the team can create a user story. All are responsible for keeping them up to date.

- We use epics to represent user stories. For an epic to go into the **"Epic"** column, it should have:
    - Clear acceptance criteria
    - Definition of done  
    - A user story that reflects the benefit to a Veteran, Caregiver, or other user
    - Been broken up into discreet tasks/Github tickets that are attatched to the epic
    - All components/steps have been accounted for in the epic
    - Documented risks: Risks: Value Risk, Feasibility Risk, Business Viability Risk, Usability Risk

- For a task to go into the **"Icebox"** column, it must have the following:
   - Title that explains the goal
   - Labels: _vsa-caregivers_ and what category it falls into (backend, front-end, research, design, product)

- For a task to go into the **"Backlog"** column, it must have the following:
   - Title that explains the goal in plain language
   - Linked to a user story/epic
   - Includes (as needed) background, goal and acceptance criteria   

- For a task to go into the **"Ready"** column, it must have the following:
   - Estimate
   - Sense of priority (relative to other tickets)
   
- During Sprint Planning, we'll move tickets into the **"Current Sprint"** column
- As they are worked, tickets get moved into **"In Progress"**

- For a task to be in **"Blocked"** 
   - An external dependency prevents the ticket from being completed
   
- For a task to be in **"Validate"** 
   - All work related to the ticket is implemented
   - Acceptance criteria have been met
   - Work is accessible in staging and ready to ship to production 

- For a task to be **"Done"** 
   - Validation has occured
   - Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect when validation has occurred and by whom. 

- If there are new work requests or sudden changes, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Estimation
We use fibonacci numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to account for the level of effort, complexity, and amount of unknowns in our work. Here is our guide:
| Number | Meaning |
| -------| --------|
| 0  | I know exactly what needs to be done, and I don't need to change any code.
| 1  | I know exactly what needs to be done, and it involves changing a tiny bit of code.
| 2  | I'm pretty sure I know what needs to be done, it's a bit complex, and it will involve creating/updating tests.
| 3  | I have a good idea what needs to be done, but it's fairly complex, and there could be some unknowns.
| 5  | I know what needs to be done at a high level, but is significant complexity, and there are some large unknowns.
| 8  | I understand the concept and the goals, but there is high complexity and critical unknowns.
| 13 | There are too many unknowns, and we'll need to break this down into smaller chunks.

#### User story validation
- All team members are responsible for validation, but different team members will specialize in different areas.
- For anything considered a "release" or significant change, Tze (the VSA QA lead) will be responsible for QA
- Engineers will be responsible for ensuring and documenting in the ticket that all acceptance criteria are met
- Design is responsible for ensuring that design and content specifications are met
- PM and PO will be responsible for end-to-end QA and communication to stakeholders


## Team Norms
- We are iterate often and deliver frequently
- We are respectful, both online and off
- We turn on cameras as often as possible at meetings / calls
- We are flexible and intentional in the way we work
- We communicate often and in public channels
- We ask questions when they arise
- We listen without judgement
- We keep our work simple and clean
- We validate each others' work
- We do reviews in independent environments
- We hold each other accountable
- We stick to our commitments as best as possible
- We are respectful of others' time


#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. All work is documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
