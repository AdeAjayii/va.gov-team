## How we work

### Workflow + Cadence

#### Stand-up
Check in on people and product progress

- Every day @ 11am Eastern
- 30 min
- 3 Question Format: What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? Any impediments?

#### Sprint Planning
Outline work to be done this sprint in order to accomplish the team's goals

- 1st Monday of every sprint week @ 3pm ET
- 1 hour


#### Retro
Review accomplishments from prior sprint, what went well, what can be improvemed, what questions people have, and generate action items.

- 1st Wednesday of every sprint @ 11:30ET
- 30 min

#### Grooming
Create, review, estimate, and prioritize backlog items.

- 2nd Wednesday of every sprint, 10:00am
- 1 hour

#### Issue Etiquette
For an issue to go into the Ready column, it must have the following (created using the “Standard Issue Template”):

- Estimate
- Title that explains task
- Description with Background and Acceptance Criteria
- Labels: _vsa-caregivers_
- User Story (if applicable), Goal, and Acceptance Criteria
- Nested in an Epic

All work should be validated either in staging or production, as defined by the acceptance criteria. Each ticket's last comment before closing should reflect whether validation has occurred, and by whom. By default, assign your PM to validate any tasks you are unable to validate yourself.

If there is a new RED LIGHT URGENT work request, contact the Product Manager and ask for help to work it into the sprint

#### Estimation
We use fibonacci numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to account for the level of effort, complexity, and amount of unknowns in our work. Here is our guide:
| Number | Meaning |
| -------| --------|
| 0  | I know exactly what needs to be done, and I don't need to change any code.
| 1  | I know exactly what needs to be done, and it involves changing a tiny bit of code.
| 2  | I'm pretty sure I know what needs to be done, it's a bit complex, and it will involve creating/updating tests.
| 3  | I have a good idea what needs to be done, but it's fairly complex, and there could be some unknowns.
| 5  | I know what needs to be done at a high level, but there is a good amount of work due to complexity, and there are some big unknowns we’ll discover.
| 8  | I understand the concept and the goals, but there is high complexity and critical unknowns.
| 13 | There are too many unknowns, and we'll need to break this down into smaller chunks.

#### Team Norms

- Be respectful, both online and off
- Show your face as often as possible at meetings / calls
- Speak up! - everyone’s voice matters
- We are flexible, but intentional in the way we work
- We communicate often and in public channels
- We ask questions when they arise
- We listen without judgement

#### Slack:

This is our main means of communication with each other. Keep as much conversation in public channels as possible, to minimize duplicative and extraneous communication.

#### GitHub
GitHub is the single source of truth. All work is documented for tracking and capacity planning.

#### General things
- Update tickets regularly. If conversations happen in Slack that are pertinent to a product or initiative, copy the useful info into GitHub/ZenHub.
- Extra time? Explore the "Ready" column in ZenHub.
