# Caregiver Backlog

## In progress
- Signature certification - this is not really signature certification. This is about checking the appropriate box based on if they are a relative or not. I would suggest you put it in a user story.
- Secondary caregiver only applications - Ability to use the 10-10CG online form to add a secondary caregiver
- Integration with downtime notifications - I would have a screen shot of what this looks like or write it as a user story.
- Retry sending PDF if it fails the first time - this is a solution to the problem that some submissions to CARMA are missing PDFs

## Up next (unprioritized)

- Support additional languages (Spanish, etc)
- Attach Power of Attorney (POA) documentation
- Confirmation receipt (email, attach CARMA case ID) - I don't know what this means
- Allow re-submission after failure
- Create a separate page for application failures - This is to create a cleaner experience for the applicant. I think you would have to show how it looks now and it could be confusing and what an separate page will look like
- Improve facility labels/mapping to clinics
- Notifications on application status - Not sure what this is?
- 10-10CG Form shanges - I think you mean changes
- Store application payload in CARMA - what does this mean and what is the impact to the applicant or the Program team. This would be clearer if you write it as a user story.
- Allow user to download PDF after successful submission

## Long term (unprioritized) 
- Allow Caregivers to check application status (unauthenticated portal?)
- Portal to track/manage benefits
- Allow authenticated submissions - I would another term vs. autheniticated. Drupal and authenticate are very VA.gov terms and most people would use terms like Intro or landing page. For autheniticted, I would suggest using words like when they have logged in or signed into VA.gov.
