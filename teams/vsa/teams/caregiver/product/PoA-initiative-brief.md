# Initiative Brief Template
#### Overview

<details>
 
 *There is roughly a 1:many relationship between products and initiatives, or our attempts to improve a product/achieve Veteran outcomes. The same goes for product outlines and initiative briefs. This template can be used as product documentation for the Collaboration Cycle, especially when iterating an existing product. In addition, the Brief is an important communication tool within a team and between the team and Crew Chief/PO/other teams.*

## Outcome Summary

Increase percentage of acceptable Caregiver PoA documents

## Problem
Legal representatives of Veterans are required to confirm their right to represent Veterans when submitting a 10-10cg. 

As of August 2021, only about 30% of Power of Attorney (PoA) documents uploaded via the online 10-10CG are valid and complete PoA documents. Most are either incorrect documents or partial documents. 

We recently added messaging via an expandable section to specify the correct document types, but it hasn't had much of an impact. As a result, the Sign-as-a-Representative feature was reduced from 75% to 50% availability per Caregiver Program office request.

### Desired User Outcomes
- *Why would a user want to use this?*
  - Caregivers with the right to represent a Veteran want a way to affirm their legal status.
- *With this problem solved, what should users be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
  - 

### Undesired User Outcomes
- Confusion around what's acceptable PoA documentation vs. not
### Desired Business Outcomes

- *Why would your business want this to exist?*
  - To ensure that invalid documents do not inundate Caregiver offices.
- *With this problem solved, what should your business be able to do/achieve that they couldn't before?*
  - More accurately determine the outcome of a Caregiver submission with PoA
