### Facility Locator
The Facility Locator is an unauthenticated search tool which can be used to find VA facilities and services. It leverages the Facilities API for VA owned and operated facilities and connects to the Community Care Provider Profile Management System (PPMS) for VA network locations. Search results connect to modernized websites for VAMCs and Vet Centers or legacy detail pages which provide basic location and service information for VBA and cemeteries.

### VAMC modernized pages
Modernized VAMC websites are comprehensive facility pages designed to meet the needs of Veterans, their families and caregivers. The pages provide the location details needed before visiting and easy access to top tasks and digital health tools. It is powered by a custom Drupal content management system (CMS). Content is differentiated across levels of governance - VHA national, VAMC system and VAMC local facility. During the roll-out, the Facilities team had responsibility for the front-end, from content API to Veteran-facing UI.
