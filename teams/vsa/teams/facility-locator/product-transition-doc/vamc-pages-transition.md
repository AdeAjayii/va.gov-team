## VAMC modernized pages product overview
Modernized VAMC websites are comprehensive facility pages designed to meet the needs of Veterans, their families and caregivers. The pages provide the location details needed before visiting and easy access to top tasks and digital health tools. They are powered by a custom Drupal content management system (CMS). Content is differentiated across levels of governance - VHA national, VAMC system and VAMC local facility. During the roll-out, the Facilities team had responsibility for the front-end, from content API to Veteran-facing UI.
