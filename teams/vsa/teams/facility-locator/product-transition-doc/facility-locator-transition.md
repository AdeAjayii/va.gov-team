<br>

> The purpose of this transition document is to outline the current state of VA.gov's Facility Locator. It serves as a "front door" to documentation and resources collected during the course of product design and development. Included are links to more specific transition hubs where you can find direct links to resources and references used during design and development.

## Facility Locator product overview
The Facility Locator is an unauthenticated search tool which can be used to find VA facilities and services. It leverages the Facilities API for VA owned and operated facilities and connects to the Community Care Provider Profile Management System (PPMS) for VA network locations. Search results connect to modernized websites for VAMCs and Vet Centers or legacy detail pages which provide basic location and service information for VBA and cemeteries. Map functionality is provided by Mapbox.

## Facility Locator product approach 
The Facility Locator is a unautheniticated tool where Veterans and beneficiaries search for VA facilities (across VHA, VBA, and NCA) and in-network Community Care locations. 
It is the newer version of VA's Legacy directory](https://www.va.gov/directory/guide/home.asp). It was previously powered by the non-public-facing Vets API but now gets VA facility information from the public-facing [Lighthouse Facilities API](https://developer.va.gov/explore/facilities). Community care data comes from a separate external, non-public facing database called Provider Profile Management System (PPMS). It uses [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) for mapping. 

Our mission in 2019 was to consolidate the many, many disparate finders and locator tools into one facility search tool.
