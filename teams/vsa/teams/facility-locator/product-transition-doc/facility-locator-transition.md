## Facility Locator product overview
The Facility Locator is an unauthenticated search tool which can be used to find VA facilities and services. It leverages the Facilities API for VA owned and operated facilities and connects to the Community Care Provider Profile Management System (PPMS) for VA network locations. Search results connect to modernized websites for VAMCs and Vet Centers or legacy detail pages which provide basic location and service information for VBA and cemeteries. Map functionality is provided by Mapbox.
