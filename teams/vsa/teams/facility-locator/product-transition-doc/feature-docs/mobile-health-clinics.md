## Feature background

## UX design and research work products

Phase	|	Purpose	|	Artifact	|	Notes
---	|	---	|	---	|	---
Discovery:  Initial discovery sprint with 5 health systems (PAOs, clinical managers, emergency mgmt)	|	Purpose: To understand how mobile clinics are being used across the country, so that we accurately represent them on VA.gov facility web pages. 	|	 [Research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/research-findings.md)	|	
Discovery/Design Round 1	|	Synthesis board with MMU/Mobile uses cases & Round 1 design	|	[Synthesis ](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/files/MMU-Discovery-Phase-2.pdf)  	|	Collection of MMU use cases from interviews with PAOs, emergency management and clinical staff. On the right side of the Mural, is a first round of design solutions/exploration for the various use cases.
Discovery/Design Round 2	|		|	[Interview session notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HmL0sVDIzFQ2pLO7yochHyLy2p1GKyS0nWGeJw0UlqY/edit?usp=sharing)	|	
Discovery/Design Round 3	|	Discovery prep board	|	[Mural](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/files/MMU-Discovery-Phase-1.pdf) 	|	Choosing which facilities across VISNs to include in discovery
Discovery/Design Round 4	|		|	[Research plan, PAO outreach and communication](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/files/stakeholder-interview-plan.md)	|	
Design Round 2	|	Mural exploration of design solutions	|	[Mural](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/files/MMU-Discovery-Phase-3.pdf)	|	
Design Validation	|	Purpose: to validate or invalidate the MVP design of the new schedule section for use by mobile clinic/MMU facility types: 1) Identify problems with design 2) Discover opportunities to consider for future iterations.	|[Research Findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery-round-2/research-findings.md)	|	Design feedback discussions with 2 health systems using MVP design
Final design	|	MVP solution, "smallest slice", that unblocks health systems to publish mobile clinic facility pages with multiple schedules	|	[Prototype in UXPin - Oct 2021](https://preview.uxpin.com/20fd05cf8e86ce628f0c813166424d0a6ca38bfd#/pages/142019860/documentation/sitemap) - Final MVP design with specs and documentation / [UXPin file (.UXP)](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/design/Mobile%20Clinic%20Schedule%20Section.uxp) - downloadable UXPin file, in case the prototype link ever breaks"	|	**Note:** This design **does not address** all the use cases uncovered as detailed in [discovery research findings](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery/research-findings.md) and [design validation](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/facilities/medical-centers/product/vamc-vha-mobile-redesign/discovery-round-2/research-findings.md) documentation
