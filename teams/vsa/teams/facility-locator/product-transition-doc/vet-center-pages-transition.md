## Vet Center pages product overview
Vet Center pages were created to establish web presence for this group of underutilized VA facilities and the services they deliver. The Vet Center MVP was informed by a group of 10 Vet Center outreach specialists and was intentionally designed to be lean, providing information about Vet Center services and the locations where they are available.  They are powered by a custom Drupal content management system (CMS). Content is differentiated across levels of governance - Vet Center national and local Vet Center facility.

## Vet Center pages product approach 
Vet Center pages were intentionally designed to be lean, meeting the minimum needs expressed by Veterans (the location, hours and other details needed to visit along with information about services), based on
- lessons learned from the VAMC modernized page roll-outs
- input from MVP group of Vet Center editors and RCS leadership
- fact that these pages establish online presence for the first timne (rather than replacing any existing pages)
Once the roll-out is complete, we plan to re-evaluate additional features and will highly conisder making a set of features "optionsal"/"a la carte" for Vet Centers are interested and feel equipped to tackle additional areas.
