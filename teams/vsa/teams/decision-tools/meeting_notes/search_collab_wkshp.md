### Attendees

### Agenda
 We'll return to our Mural board and decide on a few viable options to explore further.

Since our last meeting, two ideas deemed non-viable have been denoted, and remainder are grouped by common theme -- meaning they can be done together, or doing one will remove the need for another.  

We'll bring those over in their groups and then identify: 
Which have research evidence to support
Which may be a challenge due to external resource constraints (CMS, content, etc.)
Which may warrant further research to support

From there, we'll vote on which initiatives make the most sense to delve into
