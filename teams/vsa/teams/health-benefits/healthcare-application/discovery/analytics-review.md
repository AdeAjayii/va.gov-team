#  Health Care Application discovery: Analytics review

## Project overview

As part of the Health Care Application Discovery Sprint, we will conduct an analytics review to learn more about user behavior related to the Health Care Application (HCA). 

## Goals

Analytics are an especially good way of seeing what people are doing. They can't tell us "why," but they can tell us "what." The team wanted to gain insight into the following:

The assumption is that the online application for the Health Care Application (10-10EZ) has declined
- Want to validate this with data 
Whatâ€™s date frame (i.e. last six months, last year, etc) that can provide an accurate picture of this
- Completion trends for online Health Care Applications 
- What is the entry point for the intro page (subway map) of the HCA? 
- What are the drop off points within the HCA? 
- Any other areas we should be looking at? 

Was there a simpler trend in paper applications as well (Lauren Alexanderson)
