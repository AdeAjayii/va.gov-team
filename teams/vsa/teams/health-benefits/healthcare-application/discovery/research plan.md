# Draft Research Plan for [Caregiver, Health Care Application, November 2020]
As a designer I need to create a research plan to share with my team.	(This should be filled out and maintained by the designer on the team & can be cross-linked and referenced in any issues.) 	
## Goals	
This reserach is being conducted on the Health Care Application by the Caregiver team.

2. Background: Briefly, what is the background on this product? What would a new person on the team need to know about this product?

**Research Objectives**

- Understand if there are any opportunities to improve the online experience in applying for health care benefits with the VA. 
- Prioritize recommendations, including design and technical solutions, based on these findings.

**The research questions we want to address are:**
- How do Veterans learn of the HCA and what are their motivations when applying? 
- What is the Veteran’s journey when accessing the digital HCA? 
- What is the Veteran experience of the online HCA? 
- Do Veterans understand the application process? Some common questions Veterans have when applying with the online application?  
- What are the drop off points within the HCA?
- What do Veterans expect to happen after they’ve submitted the form?
- What is the average time an application takes to be processed? 
- Do Veterans prefer to complete the application online or via the paper process? Why?

**Our hypothesis**
- There is an overall drop in online applications 
- There are obstacles preventing the Vetern from completing the digital HCA 
- TBD (informed by analytics) 

## Method	

**Analytics**

Leverage Google Analytics to understand current behavior and interactions of Veterans with the HCA (10-10EZ) 

- Completion trend for online applications 
- What is the entry point for the intro page (subway map) of the HCA? 
- What are the drop off points within the HCA? 

**Qualitative Interviews**

Qualitative Interviews will be conducted remotely with Zoom. Qualitative Interviews explore the views, experiences, beliefs and/or motivations of individuals. Remote observers and note takers will be in attendance.  

**Why this method?**

How does this methodology help you answer your research questions? 	
3.	Where are you planning to do your research? *If in person, mention the location, point of contact, arrangements, etc. If online, mention which tool you'll be using (GTM, Join.me, etc.)*	
4.	What will you be testing? *(Design mocks, card sort, prototype, page, content, etc.)* 	
5.  If remote: What tool do you plan to use (Zoom, GoToMeeting, Webex)	
## Participants and Recruitment	

We would like to work with Perigean to recruit remote users. We would like to interview 6-8 Veterans. Participant criteria:
All participants must be Veterans.

Participant pool should be diverse in:
- Branch of service
- Gender (30% or more women)
- Race
- Age (ideally two people each from 18-30, 31-50, 50-64, 65+, but can be flexible)
- Geography
- Density (rural)
- Veterans with a disability rating of 80% or higher


Please list your participant criteria in two categories-
1. **Primary criteria / Must have** - what absolutely must be true in order to run your study? The clearer you can write this criteria, the easier it is to find matches for your study. (i.e. if your study will only work if you're talking to Veterans who have My HealtheVet premium accounts, mention that here. OR, if you are using a prototype tool that will not work well with screen readers, mention that as well.) 

2. **Secondary criteria / Would like to have** - what other criteria would strengthen your results?

*Pro tips for writing recruiting critera:* 
- If you have specific screener questions that YOU would ask a potential participant to determine eligibility for your study, list them here. For example, instead of saying "We want someone who has been to an urgent care facility recently", say "Have you been to an urgent care facility in the last 6 months? (Answer should be yes)"
- Do not assume that your recruiters or the participants know your products or requirements as well as you do. Provide links to products, clear descriptions, specifics, etc. 

2.	What is your recruitment strategy? 	
(If in person, describe how you will find participants. If remote, mention if you plan to draw from the existing recruiting contract - Perigean - or if there are other places where you would like to reach out to find participants specifically for this project. If you need help, please contact Research Contract Lead.)	

## When? 	
1.	Timeline: What dates do you plan to do research? 	
(IF you are using the research recruiting contract, please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote, 2+ weeks for in person.) 	
2.	Prepare: When will the thing you are testing be ready? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.) 	
3. Length of Sessions: How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.
4.	Availability: If applicable, when would you like sessions scheduled? **Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time**. Please request enough dates and time slots (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.). Be as flexible as possible, cognizant that many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.	Specify how much time you want between sessions, if any.
5.	Pilot: Please indicate a date before your sessions begin for piloting your research. Which member of the design team will you pilot your research with? 	
## Team Roles	
Please list the people who will be serving in each role. **Include the primary phone number for moderator and the emails for moderator, notetaker, and observers. If you need Perigean to take notes for you, indicate that next to Notetaker** 	
- Moderator:	
- Research guide writing and task development (usually but not always same as moderator):	
- Participant recruiting & screening:	
- Project point of contact:	
- Participant(s) for pilot test:	
- Note-takers:	
- Observers:	
**List email addresses for those who should attend and observe the sessions: VA Stakeholders, engineering team members, design team members, any other people who might find this research relevant to their work**
