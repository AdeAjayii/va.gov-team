# Legacy VA content

_How many URLs does VA currently have? Where are they managed (TeamSite, WordPress)? What's the usage data? How many are legally required pages? How many are tier 1 or tier 2 Veteran-facing? How many are tier 3 administration, program, or office content?_

## As of 8/03/20

VA had 530 subdomain sites. We could map only 379 of them.*

__The 379 subdomains contained over 450.3K URLs, including 43.4K PDFs.__*


__VA.gov:__
- __56.9K URLs__

- 19.6K PDFs

We don't know how many of these public pages contain internal meeting notes, videos, and other materials.


__Facilities:__
- __117.9K URLs__ (mostly for VHA facilities)

- 15.1K PDFs

- There are additional URLs for VBA facilities.

_* We were able to crawl only 379 subdomains. The remaining subdomains had pages that could not be mapped (because of the way they were built) but probably do have content. So this is an undercount of what's really out there._
