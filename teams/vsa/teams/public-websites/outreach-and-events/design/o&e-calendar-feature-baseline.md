#### As a user of the Outreach & Events calendar:

- I want to find events by date (month, day) and time so that I know what's happening based on my schedule/availability.
- I want to find events by location so that I know what's happening in my area (e.g. at my VAMC).
- I want to find events by event type so that I know what's happening in-person vs. online/virtual.
- I want to find events by interest/need so that I know if there events of special interest to me (e.g. VA benefits, education, Community Care etc.).
- I want to find events based on my status (Veteran, beneficiary, caregiver, etc.) so that I can find events relevant to my role.
