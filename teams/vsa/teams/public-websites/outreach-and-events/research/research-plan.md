# Research Plan for Public Websites, Outreach & Events, Nov 2021

## Background
The Outreach & Events calendar provides a listing of upcoming national VA events that Veterans can browse and sign up to attend (without logging in). The current user experience is a flat listing of upcoming events, and we are adding the following two new capabilities:
1. Filtering events by date range
1. Viewing recurring events

[Product Outline](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/outreach-events/product-outline.md)

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services
- Increase the quality and reliability of VA services

### Veteran Journey
Where does your product fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf)? Find VA events to attend throughout 
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging 

## Research Goals	
The goals of this research are to get user feedback on our designs for
1. Filtering by date range
2. Viewing recurring events

### Outcome
We will consider findings and recommendations from this research to refine our designs before launch.

### Research questions
1. How intuitive is our design for filtering by date range?
    1. What do Veterans expect to see as options for date range? How different from our design?
    2. How accessible to screen reader users is the date range filter dropdown?
1. How intuitive is our design for recurring events? Do Veterans understand that the event is repeating?
    1. Are Veterans able to register for individual events in the series of recurring events?
    2. Are Veterans able to register for the whole series of recurring events?
1. What kind of location information for events do Veterans want to see in the list of events? (e.g., virtual/in-person, city, address)
    1. For in-person events, is the city enough information (i.e., street address not needed)?

### Hypotheses
1. Filtering events by date range will enable Veterans to find events that fit in their schedules
2. Seeing which events are recurring will enable Veterans to register for all events they're interested in

## Method	
We will conduct remote moderated usability research sessions via Zoom. Research participants will be asked some questions about their experience with VA eents, and then they will use the new Outreach & Events design to browse the event listing of one-time and recurring events and register for some. 

Because we want to include some participants who use screen readers, all participants will access the new design on the Staging server. If this "working prototype" isn't possible to do within the desired timeframe, a UXPin prototype could be used instead, but at the expense of exclusing participants who use screen readers.

### Research materials
*Note: your OCTO/VA lead must review and approve all research materials – including this plan –  prior to submitting a recruitment request.*

## Recruitment	

OCTO works with Perigean, a small business, to handle the [recruitment](https://veteranusability.us/), scheduling, and compensation of Veterans and caregivers. 

Before writing your recruitment criteria, be sure to review the following resources. 
- [Refer to the Perigean Recruitment Guidance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/planning/perigean-recruiting-guidance.md) to learn how Perigean recruits, screens, and prepares participants for research. 
- [Refer to the inclusive recruitment strategies](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md) to learn how to be inclusive of underserved Veteran communities.

### Recruitment approach
Who is your intended audience for this research (e.g. Veterans, caregivers, VSOs, SMEs), and how will you recruit them? 

Which inclusive research strategies are you leveraging for this study? OCTO recommends using a lean maximum variation strategy for most studies. Refer to the resources above to learn more. [Use the recruitment checker on Microsoft Excel teams](https://governmentcio.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/sites/VSATeam/Shared%20Documents/Accessibility/RecruitmentChecker.xlsx?d=we0ffb06d5bac4cd5902c5f8b23fe988c&csf=1&web=1&e=FzYt5t) to understand OCTO's targets for inclusivity. *Note: if you are struggling to access the online teams link; you can also [use the recruitment checker on Google sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pq7TSHZonfpzAQBJj6B2geGHlNUwZEs4DzEvxcRgu0o/edit?usp=sharing) and take a screenshot of your table to share.*

### Recruitment criteria
List the total number and type (Veterans, caregivers, etc.) of participants for this study. 

**Primary criteria (must-haves)**
What demographics, experience, and scenarios do you need participants to meet to effectively run your study? 

--> mobile users? screen reader users?

Write any recruitment criteria for experience or scenarios as screener questions with qualifying responses. Perigean will use these verbatim to recruit participants. Consider providing links to products and/or clear descriptions to ensure participants understand the question.
  Example: Have you been to a VA urgent care facility in the last 6 months? [answer should be yes to qualify.]

> Pro tip: The more recruitment criteria you have, the less likely that a small sample of participants will be able to meet all criteria. Consider how you could leverage the [lean maximum variation sampling (MVS) approach](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/recruitment.md#lean-mvs-strategy) by breaking up criteria for your study into multiple cohorts that each isolate one primary criteria. Perigean will consider each cohort as a separate recruitment effort, increasing the chances of meeting all criteria for your study. [Go to an example of the multiple cohort approach.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/digital-health-modernization/research/generative-research-study-1/2020-12.research-plan1.md#participants-and-recruitment)

**Secondary criteria (nice-to-haves)**
What criteria would strengthen your results? 

## Timeline
If you are using Perigean to recruit please submit 1 FULL week prior to the start of research for remote research, 2+ weeks for in person. 

### Prepare
When will the thing you are testing be finalized? (Goes without saying, but should be a few days before testing will begin.)

Please indicate the date and name of a mock participant for a pilot session. 
* Pilot participant email:
* Date and time of pilot session: 

### Research sessions
What dates do you plan to do research? 

### Length of sessions
How long do you estimate each session will be? (This helps with scheduling & thank you gifts.) e.g. 30 minutes, < 1 hour, up to 2 hours, up to 4 hours. 
Specify if you want Perigean to schedule the sessions with buffer time (15 minutes recommended) to allow for participants who can't make it on time, or if you might go over time.

### Availability
When would you like sessions scheduled? Please list exact dates and times in EASTERN Standard Time. *Note: we recommend providing availability outside of work hours, as many Veterans are only available before and after working times, and live across the U.S.* 
Please request enough dates and time slots for the number of requested participants. (e.g. Monday 9-1, 3-6; Tuesday 9-6, etc.).
