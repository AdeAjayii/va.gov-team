## Intro - 5 minutes

Thank you for joining us today! My name is Cindy, and I have some colleagues on the line observing and taking notes. Today we're going to talk about events put on by the VA.

Before we start, I want to go over a few things:

- **This session should take about an hour.** I want to be sure not to keep you any longer, so I may occasionally prompt you with the next question or task.
- **In this session, we want to hear your honest opinions.** There are no right or wrong answers; we are not testing your knowledge or abilities. We just want to improve these tools to better meet Veterans' needs. I welcome any and all of your feedback, and I won't be offended by any opinions you express. 
- **If for any reason and at any time you want to stop the session, please let me know.** 

- I will be sharing a web page link with you during the session. **How would you prefer to receive the URL?** 
  - I could dictate it to you, put it in the Zoom chat, email it to you, *(only if on a phone)* text it to you.
    - *(if email)* Is your current email XYX *(get from participant roster)* ?
    - *(if text)* What is your mobile phone number?

- **Are you comfortable if I record my screen and audio as we talk today?** We use the recordings to confirm that we have captured your opinions accurately. The recordings are destroyed after we complete analysis, and none of your comments will be attributed to you directly. 
    - If yes: **Once I start recording, I am going to confirm that you are ok with me recording this session once more.** 

*Start recording to the cloud.*

- **I have started recording**. I'd like to confirm: Are you comfortable if I record my screen and the audio as we talk today? 

## Screen sharing instructions (if needed)
- For screen reader users, if already hearing their screen reader on Zoom, don't check "share computer audio"
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. In the center is a green button that says Share (phone) or Share Screen (computer). 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
  - (If you have more than one screen, the row of buttons may be on the screen that's being shared)

- Now I'd like you to share your screen with me. Tap on the green button that says Share. You will then see options for what to share. Please choose "Screen" or  your web browser.
  - *(on a phone)* You will be asked to select what you'd like to share. Please choose "Screen" and then "Start now". If you see any additional prompts please read them aloud and I will help.
  - Great, now I can see your screen! Thank you for your patience in figuring this out.

- iPad: Broadcast screen

- *Backup plan if they cannot figure out how to share screen:*
  - Ok, it seems like we're having trouble sharing your screen, so I'm going to share my screen with you and give you control of it. Does that sound ok? *[Share your screen]*. Can you confirm if you can see my screen? *[Give mouse control]* Can you click and see if you can move your mouse around on my screen?

## Instructions for finding Zoom chat (if needed)
- In the Zoom application on your phone or computer, you'll see a row of buttons at the bottom. 
  - Computer: Just to the left of center is a conversation bubble that says Chat. 
    - *If don't see chat, ASK:* Do you see the red "Stop Share" button? If so, put your mouse just above it and see if you see more Zoom controls. Then click on the Chat button in the center of the Zoom controls.
  - Phone: On the far right is a More button or 3 dots. Tap that and then on Chat or the conversation bubble. 
  - If you don't tap the screen for a while, all the buttons at the bottom will hide. To get them back, you can tap/click anywhere on the screen, and they'll show up again.
 
## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
*NOTE how to share URL: dictate / Zoom chat / email / text* 

Letâ€™s start with a few questions... 

- Have you ever attended an event (e.g., presentation, workshop/class, outreach event) put on by the VA or a Veteran Service Organization? 
	- If so, can you tell me about that experience? 
	- How did you hear about it? 
	- How did you sign up for it?
- If you wanted to attend a VA sponsored event, how would you find it?
- If you saw a list of events, how would you try to find the one you're looking for? 
  - RECORD: how they want to search/filter 

### If using a screen reader
- What assistive technology are you using today?
- How would you rate your level of experience with using a screen reader--beginner, intermediate, advanced, or expert?
- How long have you been using a screen reader?
- Are you wearing headphones today?
  - *(if on desktop)* Could you please share your audio with me on Zoom?
  - *(if on mobile)* Would it be possible for you to take them off and use your computer or mobile audio? 
  - I'm asking so I will be able to hear your screen reader during the session.

### For all participants
- What device are you using today? *(Phone / Tablet / Computer)*

## Screen sharing
I would like you to share your screen with me so I can watch you use a specific website. I'll need to see your desktop. You should first close any other applications that you don't want me to see.
*(refer to Screen sharing instructions above, if needed)*

## Veteran Tasks
I would like you to look at a website that I will share with you. While you're looking at it, I would like you to **talk aloud** as much as possible so that you share what you're thinking, what you're doing, what you like, what you dislike, and what you're unsure about. Before you click/tap anywhere on the screen, I would like you to *tell me what you want to do*, and I may ask you questions about that, before telling you to go ahead and try it.

Imagine that... I'll have you start from a website that I'm going to *(spell/put into the Zoom chat/email/text)* for you to click on (https://staging.va.gov/XXX/).


### Task 1: [ ] - 5 minutes
Instructions

- Please talk me through what you're doing. 
  



## (if time) Post-Task Interview - 5 minutes
*Type into #feedback-backchannel: "Any questions you want me to ask?"*

- What did you *like* about what you've seen today?
- What did you *dislike* about what you've seen today?
- What would you like to *change* about what you've seen today?
- Is there anything else that we haven't talked about that you think I should know? 

## Thank You and Closing - 1 minute

Well we really appreciate you taking the time to share your thoughts with us today. Your feedback is so helpful to us as we continue to work on improving the VA website.
