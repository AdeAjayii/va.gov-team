# Outreach & Events Date Filter Design Options

### Cindy Merrill, VSA Public Websites team, Nov 12, 2021


## Current Design
We planned to usability test the following new dropdown for date filtering in Outreach & Events.

When I started putting together sample event lists for each dropdown option, we encountered a major usabilty problem with the design.


PROS  | CONS
------|------
Design approved by Dave, Collab Cycle | Usability issue: **5 of 7 options will show the same filtered events lists** with all of today's events at the top
. | **Hard to show the difference in design prototype screens** w/o requiring a LOT of scrolling by participants, or showing only a few events in the list
. | Missing opportunity for user feedback by showing a design we already know is problematic



## Proposed Design Change
Cassandra Allen and I discussed the issue and shared our thoughts with Josh Kim, who had suggested the dropdown options as a more accessible alternative to a calendar date picker. We thought that seeing all upcoming events made more sense than the overlapping and confusing dropdown options we had. 
Without a way to select a date range in the future, showing all upcoming events in one list made the most sense to us.

PROS  | CONS
------|------
Usability issue resolved | Functionally similar to the toggle button on Production today
Upgrades functionality on Production to match the design system for accessibility| Dave expects a new design for date filtering, which this isn't
Easy to show distinct event lists in design prototype | Need Design Intent approval, or not because it's the current view options on Production?
Will get user feedback on the 2-option design, which we don't have for the current O&E in Production
Easy for Cassandra to make this change in the prototype

## Other Ideas??
If we can come up with any more mutually-exclusive options for the dropdown, we could usability test those instead...
