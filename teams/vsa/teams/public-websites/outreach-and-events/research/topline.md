This topline summary is a high level, top-of-mind summary of trends observed in the research sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. *The information in this document may change, following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.*

**The goal of this document is as follows:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from the team/stakeholders and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
 - To jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Introduction
The purpose of this research was to get user feedback on the following **2 new design features** for Outreach & Events:
1. Filtering by date range
2. Viewing recurring events together

## Participants
We talked to **7 Veterans plus 1 Caregiver** and asked them to interact with a mobile prototype on their smartphones. 

None of them had ever seen the Outreach Events page on VA.gov before, and only 4 had ever attended a VA event before. Of those 4, one signed up in person at the VA, one was signed up by their therapist, one signed up through Facebook, and one doesn't remember because it was years ago.

## Findings
### Usability Successes
1. 7 of 8 participants understood recurring events in the prototype and how to register for individual occurrences.
2. All participants who used the date filter (which was 7 of 8 participants) had no difficulty using the *Apply filter* button. 1 person didn't use it at first but then did when they saw that the list didn't change.
1. Participants found it easy to navigte from an event detail page to the event list by using the browser back button (6 participants), the breadcrumbs (1 participant), or *In this section menu > Outreach events* (1 participant). 
3. When asked about what location information should be displayed in the event list, all 8 participants wanted the city and state (as shown in the prototype). A few people had additional suggestions, which could be in the event detail page but possibly also in the event list (space-permitting):

### Usability Issues
1. 7 of 8 participants had strong negative reactions to finding events with only a date filter, which is not how they wanted to look for events, particularly when they didn't know when specific events might be. They didn't want to scan down multiple pages of events in the default _All upcoming_ date filter. They instead wanted to filter by location (i.e., their state) or type of event (i.e., XXXX), or do a keyword search (i.e., for "yoga" or "Veteran jobs" or "Memorial Day"). 
> "I wouldn’t filter by date because I don’t know when it is" (p10).
> "Too much of everything with random events--like a classified section" (p2).
> "I wouldn't have a clue on this site how to look that up. I would probably end up looking under 1, 2, 3, and Next. You'd probably end up having to go through every cotton-pickin' one and press page 2, look, look, page 3, look, look because there's no way to break it down. You'd have to look at every single page and read every one to see if you could find it" (p1).

### Other Observations
1. No one mentioned the 12-month limitation on date entry, so participants probably ignored it (or possibly understood it).

## Recommendations (*Preliminary*)
Because implementation is underway, a few preliminary recommendations are listed here. These should be considered tentative because they may change as a result of further data synthesis and discussions with the team.
