# Research Plan for Veteran Top Tasks, Public Websites, Feb X, 2022

## Background
The current design of the VA.gov home page provides easy access to some Veteran tasks in four boxes near the top of the page. [User research on the home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) has shown that other tasks are more challenging to do from the home page. 
We would like to learn which tasks Veterans most want to do on VA.gov.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

### Veteran Journey
Veteran tasks fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging 

## Research Goals	
The goal of this research is to identify Veteran top tasks. We hope to find a set of 5-10 tasks that are most important from an initial set of about 40 tasks.

### Outcome
The top tasks that we identify could be used in future user research studies and design efforts on VA.gov. We could measure the success rate and time on task as metrics across research studies.

### Research questions
1. When Veterans visit VA.gov, what tasks are most important to them? 

### Hypotheses


## Method	
Starting from a list of about 30 tasks compiled from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches, we will put together a card sort activity on Optimal Workshop. Veterans will rate the importance of each task by sorting it into a category (i.e., very important, somewhat important, not important, I don't understand this task). 

We would like to get sorting responses from **at least 30 Veterans and Caregivers**, with  
- **20 unmoderated** in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA)
- **10 moderated** via Zoom

The purpose of the moderated sessions is to gather some qualitative feedback on the tasks and their relative importance. 

*Action item:* Analyze and remove duplicates from tasks collected to get down to a list of ~30 tasks.

*Action item:* Get access to the new VSA account for Optimal Workshop from Yana or Shawna.

*Action item:* Create card sort in Optimal Workshop with a question for participants to provide their unique code, and then generate separate links for each recruitment cohort.
