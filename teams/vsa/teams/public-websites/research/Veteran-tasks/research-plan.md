# Research Plan for Veteran Top Tasks, Public Websites, Feb X, 2022

## Background
The current design of the VA.gov home page provides easy access to some Veteran tasks in four boxes near the top of the page. [User research on the home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) has shown that other tasks are more challenging to do from the home page. 
We would like to learn more about what tasks Veterans want to do on VA.gov.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

### Veteran Journey
Veteran tasks fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging 

## Research Goals	
The goal of this research is to identify Veteran top tasks. We hope to find a set of 5-10 tasks that are most important from an initial set of 40+ tasks.

### Outcome
The Veteran top tasks that we identify can be used in future user research studies and design efforts on VA.gov. 

### Research questions
1. When Veterans visit VA.gov, what tasks are most important to them? 

### Hypotheses


## Method	
Starting from a list of about 40 tasks compiled from the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches, we will put together a card sort activity on Optimal Workshop. Veterans will rate the importance of each task by sorting it into a category. We would like to get sorting data from at least 30 Veterans, with about 20 unmoderated and about 10 moderated (via Zoom). The purpose of the moderated sessions is to hear feedback on the tasks and their importance--more qualitative data than the quantitative data from the card sort activity. 

*Action item:* Review personas and maybe propose for each persona 10 unmoderated, 2-3 moderated.

*Action item:* Need to get access to new VSA account for Optimal Workshop from Shawna.
