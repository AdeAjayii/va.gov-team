# Research Goals
The current design of the VA.gov home page provides easy access to some Veteran tasks in four boxes near the top of the page. [User research on the home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) has shown that other tasks are more challenging to do when starting from the home page. 

We wanted to learn which VA-related tasks are most important to Veterans and others, including Veterans' family members or caregivers, survivors, and service members, so that these tasks can be best supported from the home page. 

The top tasks that we identify could be used to inform the redesign of the VA.gov home page and measure the overall health of VA.gov. We can use the top tasks we identify to run baseline usability tests and then regular tests at intervals. Over time, these tests will tell us whether Veterans can quickly and easily complete all top tasks. We can also look at the navigation path(s) for each top task and examine analytics for them.

Veteran tasks fit into the Veteran journey throughout their lives:

- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions
1. When Veterans and others contact the VA, what tasks are most important to them?
4. How many tasks do Veterans and others identify as important to themselves?
5. What tasks are least important?
5. Are there any important tasks missing?
6. What tasks are done most frequently online?

# Methodology 
We conducted an unmoderated study in which participants were invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants received a link to an online survey that contains a list of 41 VA-related tasks. The online survey was built in Optimal Workshop's survey tool, which is called Questions. The survey contained a list of 41 VA-related tasks that were synthesized from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches. The list of tasks was reviewed by colleagues in IA and Content. In order to keep the list down to a manageable length, some related tasks were combined (e.g., *Learn about or apply for VA health care*), and a few tasks that are required to be supported were omitted (e.g., *Contact the Veterans Crisis Line*, and *Report harassment that occurred at a VA site or online*). The survey design has already been refined following the phase 1 [moderated research study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated/research-findings.md). 

In the survey, participants selected which VA-related tasks were important to them personally (*not* for all Veterans). Participants were also asked if there were any VA-related tasks that are important to them that weren't on the list, and which tasks they do most frequently.

We wanted to get complete survey responses from **at least 30 Veterans and others (ideally 40-50)**, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA). 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans and others will generally agree on which tasks are the most important.

    2. TRUE: . 

3. Veterans and others will generally agree on which tasks are the least important.

    2. MOSTLY TRUE: 
   

# Key Findings

1. **Overall top tasks**: The tasks selected by the most people as important were...5 of 6 were health-related. 
2. **Top tasks for those who don't use VA health care**: For the x% of participants who don't use VA health care, the top tasks were different...Overlap is 2 tasks.
3. Overlap between overall top tasks and those 
4. (Preliminary results) Participants selected an **average of X tasks as important** (ranging from Y to Z).
5. It was hard for Perigean to recruit people who don't use VA benefits because such people generally aren't interested in providing feedback to VA.


# Details of Findings 

**1. Top tasks: **

Note: We didn't get enough responses to be statistically significant.

**6. (Preliminary results) Participants selected an average of X tasks as important.**

From the list of 41 VA-related tasks presented in the survey, research **participants selected an average of X tasks as important (ranging from Y to Z)**. 

The task importance question included in the survey during this research was worded as follows (REVISE!!): 
*Please check the VA-related tasks below that are most important to YOU personally right now, no matter how you do them (in person, on the phone, or online).* 


# Recommendations
1. 


# Next Steps

- Present results to Sitewide Public Websites team
- Work with Public Websites to get top tasks into home page redesign in preparation for usability testing

## Who we talked to 

**Recruitment criteria**

We wanted to interview Veterans and others who had a diverse range of experience with VA benefits and services, including no experience at all and some experience that doesn't include VA health care.

We talked to **N participants.**

Audience segments:
* Veterans:  
* Caregivers: 
* Family members of a Veteran:  
* Service member:  


Experience with VA benefits and services:
* Experience with one or more VA benefits or services (i.e., health care, education or career services, disability benefits, housing benefits, pension, life insurance, burial benefits): **Y**
* NO experience with health care, but DO have experience with one or more other VA benefits or services: 
* NO experience with ANY VA benefits or services:  
 
**We wanted to get some participants without any VA benefits experience at all, but the participants recruited who didn't have any experience according to Perigean's recruitment survey actually did have experience**--perhaps because the survey data was outdated 

Gender:
* Male:  
* Female: 
* Unknown: 


Age:
* 25-34: 
* 35-44: 
* 45-54:

## Underserved groups we havenâ€™t talked to 

This research does not include the perspectives of the following marginalized Veteran groups:
* Identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or non-binary
* Other than honorable discharge
* Immigrant origin
* Expat (living abroad)
* Use assistive technology

**We wanted to include a few people who had a cognitive disability and someone who used a screen reader, but the participants recruited who showed up for sessions didn't have any of these characteristics.**
