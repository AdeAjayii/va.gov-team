# Research Goals
The current design of the VA.gov home page provides easy access to some Veteran tasks in four boxes near the top of the page. [User research on the home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) has shown that other tasks are more challenging to do when starting from the home page. 

We wanted to learn which VA-related tasks are most important to Veterans and others, including Veterans' family members or caregivers, survivors, and service members, so that these tasks can be best supported from the home page. 

The top tasks that we identify could be used to inform the redesign of the VA.gov home page and measure the overall health of VA.gov. We can use the top tasks we identify to run baseline usability tests and then regular tests at intervals. Over time, these tests will tell us whether Veterans can quickly and easily complete all top tasks. We can also look at the navigation path(s) for each top task and examine analytics for them.

Veteran tasks fit into the Veteran journey throughout their lives:

- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions
1. When Veterans and others contact the VA, what tasks are most important to them?
4. How many tasks do Veterans and others identify as important to themselves?
5. What tasks are least important?
5. Are there any important tasks missing?
6. What tasks are done most frequently?

# Methodology 
We conducted an unmoderated study in which participants were invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants received a link to an online survey that contains a list of 41 VA-related tasks. The online survey was built in Optimal Workshop's survey tool, which is called Questions. The survey contained a list of 41 VA-related tasks that were synthesized from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches. The list of tasks was reviewed by colleagues in IA and Content. In order to keep the list down to a manageable length, some related tasks were combined (e.g., *Learn about or apply for VA health care*), and a few tasks that are required to be supported were omitted (e.g., *Contact the Veterans Crisis Line*, and *Report harassment that occurred at a VA site or online*). The survey design has already been refined following the phase 1 [moderated research study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated/research-findings.md). 

In the survey, participants selected which VA-related tasks were important to them personally (*not* for all Veterans). Participants were also asked if there were any VA-related tasks that are important to them that weren't on the list, and which tasks they do most frequently.

We wanted to get complete survey responses from **at least 30 Veterans and others (ideally 40-50)**, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA). 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans and others will generally agree on which tasks are the most important.

    2. TRUE: . 

3. Veterans and others will generally agree on which tasks are the least important.

    2. MOSTLY TRUE: 
   

# Key Findings

1. Across all survey participants, **most top tasks were related to health care**:

2. The **most *frequently done* tasks were all related to health care** and aligned closely with the overall top tasks.

3. **For participants who don't use VA health care, top tasks were quite different** (only *disability compensation* and *VA medical records* tasks overlapped).

4. **Top tasks varied by participant age**, with older participants favoring health care and burial, while younger participants more focused on education benefits and payment history.

5. Here are the **least important tasks overall**:

6. Participants selected an **average of 9.5 tasks as important**, ranging from 1 to 26. This was interesting because we didn't include the "select up to 10" wording that was originally in the survey question.

7. It was **challenging to recruit people who don't use VA benefits** because such people generally aren't interested in providing feedback to VA. We wanted 20% of such participants but instead got only 2%.


# Details of Findings 

Notes:
- We didn't get enough responses to be statistically significant.
- Responses from **55 participants** were analyzed--**48** from the unmoderated survey (phase 2) plus **7** from the moderated interviews (phase 1).

## 1. Most top tasks were related to health care

Survey participants were asked to mark which VA-related tasks *are most important to YOU personally right now, no matter how you do them (in person, on the phone, or online).*

Five of the top 6 tasks marked as important to the greatest number of participants were related to health care, as shown in the table below. Percentages greater than 50 are highlighted in red, and 40-59% are highlighted in orange. 

![top-tasks-all-ps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-all-ps.png)

The percentages for these top tasks can be compared to all the other tasks in the bar chart and the table below (note that percentages 20-39% are highlighted in yellow).

![task-table--all-ps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-all-ps-table.png)

## 2. Most frequently done tasks were all related to health care and aligned closely with the overall top tasks

Survey participants were asked *What VA-related tasks do you do MOST FREQUENTLY?* to answer with open-ended text. By far the most numerous responses were for health care tasks:

1. Refill a prescription (15)
2. Health care visits/appointments (11)
3. Message or contact medical providers (9)
4. Schedule or check medical appointments (8)
5. MyHealtheVet (6)--no specific task

From the above list of 5 frequently done tasks, #2 and #5 weren't listed as tasks in our survey (health care visits/appointments and MyHealtheVet), but  the other 3 tasks were top tasks #1, 2, and 4 across all participants.

## 3. For participants who don't use VA health care, top tasks were quite different
(only *disability compensation* and *VA medical records* tasks overlapped)

## 5. Least important tasks overall

## 6. Participants selected an average of 9.5 tasks as important
, ranging from 1 to 26. This was interesting because we didn't include the "select up to 10" wording that was originally in the survey question.

## 7. It was **challenging to recruit people who don't use VA benefits** because such people generally aren't interested in providing feedback to VA. We wanted 20% of such participants but instead got only 2%.



**1. (Preliminary results) Participants selected an average of X tasks as important.**

From the list of 41 VA-related tasks presented in the survey, research **participants selected an average of X tasks as important (ranging from Y to Z)**. 

The task importance question included in the survey during this research was worded as follows (REVISE!!): 
*Please check the VA-related tasks below that are most important to YOU personally right now, no matter how you do them (in person, on the phone, or online).* 


# Recommendations
1. Consider grouping together health care tasks on the home page because most people will either want to do many of them or none of them. 
2. The VA.gov home page should enable people to do tasks related to their current VA benefits, as well as highlight other benefits that they're not yet using. The VA provides a large range of benefits that many people don't know about or haven't looked into their eligibility for. Consider featuring different benefits on the home page, perhaps on a rotating basis--ideally (for an authenticated user) benefits that the user isn't currently enrolled in. 


# Next Steps

- Present results to Sitewide Public Websites team
- Work with Public Websites to get top tasks into home page redesign in preparation for usability testing

## Who we talked to 

**Recruitment criteria**

We wanted to interview Veterans and others who had a diverse range of experience with VA benefits and services, including no experience at all and some experience that doesn't include VA health care.

We talked to **N participants.**

Audience segments:
* Veterans:

* NO experience with ANY VA benefits or services:  
 
**We wanted to get some participants without any VA benefits experience at all, but the participants recruited who didn't have any experience according to Perigean's recruitment survey actually did have experience**--perhaps because the survey data was outdated
