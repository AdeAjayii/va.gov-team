# Research Goals
We would like to learn which VA-related tasks are most important to Veterans and caregivers so that these tasks can be best supported from the VA.gov home page. The goal of this research was to **get feedback from Veterans and others** (including Veterans' family members or caregivers, survivors, and service members) **on a survey designed to identify Veteran top tasks**. We wanted to get feedback on the tasks, questions, and instructions before launching the unmoderated survey to a large group of Veterans and others to complete independently (without a researcher present).

*Note: Because this research is like an extended pilot of the survey, this abbreviated report describes the findings and recommendations needed to make revisions to the survey and then move forward with the unmoderated research. Some details have been omitted in order to move as quickly as possible to the unmoderated research.*

Veteran tasks fit into the Veteran journey throughout their lives:
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions
## Primary
1. Are there any tasks in the survey that are unclear or confusing?
1. Are there any important tasks missing from the survey?
1. Is there anything about the survey that is unclear or confusing?

## For unmoderated research phase, but could look at preliminary results
3. When Veterans and others contact the VA, what tasks are most important to them?
4. How many tasks do Veterans and others identify as important to themselves?
5. What tasks are least important?

# Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Research participants were asked about VA-related tasks that they do, and then were given an online survey link to do while sharing their web browser screen and talking aloud.

The online survey was built in Optimal Workshop's survey tool, which is called Questions. The survey contained a list of 41 VA-related tasks synthesized from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches. The list of tasks was reviewed by colleagues in IA and Content. In order to keep the list down to a manageable length, some related tasks were combined (e.g., *Learn about or apply for VA health care*), and a few tasks that are required to be supported were omitted (e.g., *Contact the Veterans Crisis Line*, and *Report harassment that occurred at a VA site or online*).

In the survey, participants were asked to select which VA-related tasks were important to them personally right now (*not* for all Veterans). Participants were also asked if there were any VA-related tasks that were important to them that weren't on the list, and which tasks they do most frequently.


# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans and others will find the survey intuitive to use from desktop or mobile.

    2. TRUE: All participants were able to readily fill out the survey from the desktop or mobile device they were using. 

3. Veterans and others will be able to select which of the VA-related tasks presented in the survey are most important to them.

    2. MOSTLY TRUE: All participants were able to select important tasks, but some of the tasks were unclear to a few of the participants.
   
5. Veterans and others won't find any important tasks missing from the survey.

    2. FALSE: 3 participants suggested additional tasks that they currently do that weren't on the list in the survey.

# Key Findings

1. **Top tasks**: The tasks selected by the most people as important were 
1. (Preliminary results) Participants selected an **average of X tasks as important** (ranging from Y to Z).


# Details of Findings 

**1. Top tasks: **

**6. (Preliminary results) Participants selected an average of X tasks as important.**

From the list of 41 VA-related tasks presented in the survey, research **participants selected an average of X tasks as important (ranging from Y to Z)**. 

The task importance question included in the survey during this research was worded as follows (REVISE!!): 
*Please check the VA-related tasks below that are most important to YOU personally right now, no matter how you do them (in person, on the phone, or online).* 


# Recommendations
1. 


# Next Steps

- Present results to Sitewide Public Websites team
- Work with Public Websites to get top tasks into home page redesign in preparation for usability testing

## Who we talked to 

**Recruitment criteria**

We wanted to interview Veterans and others who had a diverse range of experience with VA benefits and services, including no experience at all and some experience that doesn't include VA health care.

We talked to **N participants.**

Audience segments:
* Veterans:  
* Caregivers: 
* Family members of a Veteran:  
* Service member:  


Experience with VA benefits and services:
* Experience with one or more VA benefits or services (i.e., health care, education or career services, disability benefits, housing benefits, pension, life insurance, burial benefits): **7 (ALL of them)**
* NO experience with health care, but DO have experience with one or more other VA benefits or services: 
* NO experience with ANY VA benefits or services:  
 
**We wanted to get some participants without any VA benefits experience at all, but the participants recruited who didn't have any experience according to Perigean's recruitment survey actually did have experience**--perhaps because the survey data was outdated
