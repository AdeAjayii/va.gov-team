# Research Goals
The current design of the VA.gov home page provides easy access to some Veteran tasks in four boxes near the top of the page. [User research on the home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) has shown that other tasks are more challenging to do when starting from the home page. 

We wanted to learn which VA-related tasks are most important to Veterans and others, including Veterans' family members or caregivers, survivors, and service members, so that these tasks can be best supported from the home page. 

The top tasks that we identify could be used to inform the redesign of the VA.gov home page and measure the overall health of VA.gov. We can use the top tasks we identify to run baseline usability tests and then regular tests at intervals. Over time, these tests will tell us whether Veterans can quickly and easily complete all top tasks. We can also look at the navigation path(s) for each top task and examine analytics for them.

Veteran tasks fit into the Veteran journey throughout their lives:

- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions
1. When Veterans and others contact the VA, what tasks are most important to them?
4. How many tasks do Veterans and others identify as important to themselves?
5. What tasks are least important?
5. Are there any important tasks missing?
6. What tasks are done most frequently?

# Methodology 
We conducted an unmoderated study in which participants were invited by email to participate. After accepting the invitation, participants received a link to an online survey that contains a list of 41 VA-related tasks. The online survey was built in Optimal Workshop's survey tool, which is called Questions. The survey contained a list of 41 VA-related tasks that were synthesized from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches. The list of tasks was reviewed by colleagues in IA and Content. In order to keep the list down to a manageable length, some related tasks were combined (e.g., *Learn about or apply for VA health care*), and a few tasks that are required to be supported were omitted (e.g., *Contact the Veterans Crisis Line*, and *Report harassment that occurred at a VA site or online*). The survey design has already been refined following the phase 1 [moderated research study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated/research-findings.md). 

In the survey, participants selected which VA-related tasks were important to them personally (*not* for all Veterans). Participants were also asked if there were any VA-related tasks that are important to them that weren't on the list, and which tasks they do most frequently.

We wanted to get complete survey responses from **at least 30 Veterans and others (ideally 40-50)**, in distinct cohorts of fewer than 10 participants per cohort (per PRA). 

# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans and others will generally agree on which tasks are the most important.

    2. PARTLY TRUE: There is general agreement in task importance within subgroups of participants but not overall. There are major differences in task importance between people who are using VA health care *vs.* not using it, and also between older and younger people. 

3. Veterans and others will generally agree on which tasks are the least important.

    2. PARTLY TRUE: Same reasoning as above.
   

# Key Findings

1. Across all survey participants, **most top tasks were related to health care**:

![top-tasks-all-ps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-all-ps.png)

Resulting from additional analyses of segments of the survey responses, here's a longer list of top tasks partitioned into primary, secondary, tertiary groupings based on how often they ended up in segment top task lists:

2. The **most *frequently done* tasks were all related to health care** and aligned closely with the overall top tasks.

3. **For participants who don't use VA health care, top tasks were quite different** (only *disability compensation* and *VA medical records* tasks overlapped).

4. **Top tasks varied by participant age**, with older participants favoring health care and burial, while younger participants more focused on education benefits and payment history.

5. Here are the **least important tasks overall**:

![low-tasks-all-ps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/low-tasks-all-ps.png)

6. Participants selected an **average of 9.5 tasks as important**, ranging from 1 to 26. This was interesting because we didn't include the "select up to 10" wording that was originally in the survey question.

7. It was **challenging to recruit people who don't use VA benefits** because such people generally aren't interested in providing feedback to VA. We wanted 20% of such participants but instead got only 2%.


# Details of Findings 

Notes:
- We didn't get enough responses to be statistically significant.
- Responses from **55 participants** were analyzed--**48** from the unmoderated survey (phase 2) plus **7** from the moderated interviews (phase 1).

## 1. Most top tasks were related to health care

Survey participants were asked to mark which VA-related tasks *are most important to YOU personally right now, no matter how you do them (in person, on the phone, or online).*

Five of the top 6 tasks marked as important to the greatest number of participants were related to health care, as shown in the table below. Percentages greater than 50 are highlighted in red, and 40-59% are highlighted in orange. 

![top-tasks-all-ps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-all-ps.png)

The percentages for these top tasks can be compared to all the other tasks in the bar chart and the table below (note that percentages 20-39% are highlighted in yellow). 

![bar-chart--all-ps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-all-ps-chart.png)

## SUMMARY of top tasks overall

The goal of this research was to come up with one list of top tasks that can be used in the VA.gov home page design, usability studies, and other user research and analytics assessments of VA.gov. Survey responses from the following 6 different segments of participants were analyzed for this report: 
1. All participants
2. Participants using VA health care
3. Participants *not* using VA health care
4. Participants who were 55 years old or older
5. Participants who were 35-54 years old
6. Participants who were under 35 years old

All tasks that were marked as important by at least 30% of any one of the above segments were compiled, and the number of times that each task appeared on one of the 6 lists was tallied, along with the percentage of all participants who marked each as important. 

![top-tasks-6segments-tallies&percents](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-6segments-tallies%26percents.png)

The above results show which tasks were rated as important the most often, and this suggests the grouping below of primary, secondary, and tertiary top tasks. Within each primary/secondary/tertiary grouping, tasks are in order of decreasing percentage selected by all participants.

![top-tasks-6segments-tallies-a](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-6segments-tallies-a.png)

## 2. Most frequently done tasks were all related to health care and aligned closely with the overall top tasks

Survey participants were asked *What VA-related tasks do you do MOST FREQUENTLY?* to answer with open-ended text. By far the most numerous responses were for health care tasks:

1. Refill a prescription (15)
2. Health care visits/appointments (11)
3. Message or contact medical providers (9)
4. Schedule or check medical appointments (8)
5. MyHealtheVet (6)--no specific task

From the above list of 5 frequently done tasks, #2 and #5 weren't listed as tasks in our survey (health care visits/appointments and MyHealtheVet), but  the other 3 tasks were top tasks #1, 2, and 4 across all participants.

## 3. For participants who don't use VA health care, top tasks were quite different

Because most of the top tasks across all survey responses were related to health care, we segmented the data by participants who use VA health care (41 or 75%) and those who don't use VA health care (14 or 25%). When you compare the top tasks for each of these groups, the results are very different, and only *disability compensation* and *VA medical records* are on both lists (see below). 

For people who don't use VA health care, it might be unexpected that *Get your VA medical records* would be an important task. However, they may have medical records from past experience with VA health care (maybe they voluntarily disenrolled or became ineligible), or perhaps they mean DoD medical records from their military service.

## 4. Top tasks varied by participant age

We segmented participants by age to see whether there were difference in top tasks selected. We compared the top tasks from participants who were at least 55 years old (42% of all participants) with the top tasks from participants under 35 years old (13% of participants). The results showed that **older participants thought health care and burial tasks were most important**, whereas **younger participants were more focused on education benefits, payment history, and contact information**--and *not* health care (see tables below). Note that the older group had many more people (23 of 55) than the younger group (7 of 55). We also defined a third segment with the 25 participants (45%) who were between the oldest and youngest groups (age 35-54), and those data align more with the older group--mostly health care tasks plus disability compensation, but no burial.

</details>

## 5. Least important tasks overall

Below are the *least important* tasks across all survey participants, which were marked as important by fewer than 10% of participants.

![low-tasks-all-ps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/low-tasks-all-ps.png)

Two of these tasks involve financial help (*Get help with your rent, utility bills, or other housing-related expenses* and *Get help with your VA debt*), so perhaps most of our research participants are not currently facing financial hardship. Other low-importance tasks involve less popular VA benefits (pension, caregiver program), as well as other benefits that apply to fewer people (hearing aids, school enrollment verification--only relevant if you're currently in school).

## 6. Participants selected an average of 9.5 tasks as important

In the survey question about selecting which tasks are important, we didn't specify how many tasks to select. We had hoped that people would select about 5-10 of them. The average number selected was 9.5, with a range from 1 to 26. The average of 9.5 was interesting because we had originally included the instruction "select up to 10" but removed it. In the chart below, the number of tasks selected shows a normal curve, with the greatest number of people selecting 6-10 tasks.

![#tasks-selected](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/%23tasks-selected.png)

## 7. Challenging to recruit people who don't use VA benefits

In recruiting participants for this survey, we wanted people who had experience with a variety of VA benefits and services so that each of our tasks would be potentially relevant to at least some respondents (see chart and table below). **The greatest number of survey respondents had experience with VA health care, disability, and education.** One person wrote in that they have experience with services for MST (Military Sexual Trauma).

![benefit-experience-chart](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/benefit-experience-chart.png)

![benefit-experience-table](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/benefit-experience-table.png)

We also wanted 20% of our participants to be people who *haven't used any* VA benefits but were interested in doing so, so that the "learn about or apply" tasks might be more relevant for a group of people. Unfortunately, Perigean had difficulty recruiting people who don't use VA benefits, perhaps due to the following reasons:
1. The benefits usage data in Perigean's recruitment database may be outdated because people may have applied for new benefits after filling out the recruitment survey. This was true for one participant interviewed during a moderated session who said he had applied for a home loan Certificate of Eligibility the day before the research session. 
2. **People who don't use VA benefits generally aren't interested in providing feedback to VA.**

We had only one participant (2%) who had no experience with VA benefits, which is a long way from our original goal of 20%.

## Other Findings

### How participants interact with VA
A majority (about 60%) of survey participants use MyHealtheVet, VA.gov, visit a VA site, and/or call the VA. Somewhat fewer participants (38%) use eBenefits. A small number of people said that they don't contact the VA directly (7%) or don't interact with VA at all (6%).  

![interact-VA-chart](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/interact-VA-chart.png)

![interact-VA-table](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/interact-VA-table.png)

### Missing tasks
After the task importance question, the survey asked if there were any other important VA-related tasks that weren't in the previous list. Here is a list of the suggestions for new tasks, all of which were suggested by only one respondent:
1. Find MST (Military Sexual Trauma) events, retreats, support groups 
1. Obtain every Choice/Community Care referral provided to me for non-VA care with authorization numbers (in order to prove that VA bills were authorized by the VA and should be paid)
1. Obtain a VA satisfaction survey to rate and provide a review of my experience as a patient receiving home telehealth monitoring 
1. Find VA providers' background, education and qualifications on a VA sponsored site 
1. View patient satisfaction results for each MD/NP/DO/PA
1. Find a VA Rehab/nursing home
1. Get DME (durable medical equipment)
1. Get counseling in insurance options for Veterans (i.e. Medicare, Medicaid, Hospice)
1. Find events/ceremonies that honor Veterans around holidays like Memorial Day, Armed Forces Day, and Veterans Day
1. Get community care services
1. Learn about legislative activities that affect VA benefits and programs.
1. Obtain assistance with Board for Correction of Naval Records
1. Request for Agent Orange (AO) or illness related to AO.
1. Volunteer events to support the VA

### Feedback for VA

# Recommendations
1. Going forward, consider including the 6 primary top tasks in the VA.gov home page, usability tests, and other user research and analytics. If a longer list or wider range of tasks is needed, draw from the 9 secondary top tasks and possibly the 10 tertiary top tasks. **SPECIFY HOW MANY AND WHICH ONES**

![top-tasks-6segments-a](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/unmoderated/images/top-tasks-6segments-a.png)
     
2. With limited space to list tasks on the redesigned VA.gov home page, consider grouping together health care tasks since most users will either want to do most of them or none of them. 
2. The VA.gov home page should enable people to do tasks related to their current VA benefits, as well as highlight other benefits that they're not yet using. The VA provides a large range of benefits that many people don't know about or haven't looked into their eligibility for. Consider featuring different benefits on the home page, perhaps on a rotating basis--ideally (for an authenticated user) benefits that the user isn't currently using but could be. 


# Next Steps

- Present results to Sitewide Public Websites team
- Use some of the top tasks from this research as tasks for usability testing the home page redesign
