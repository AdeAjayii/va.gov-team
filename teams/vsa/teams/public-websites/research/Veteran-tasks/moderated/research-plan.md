# Research Plan for Veteran Top Tasks MODERATED (part 1 of 2), Public Websites, Feb X, 2022

## Background
The current design of the VA.gov home page provides easy access to some Veteran tasks in four boxes near the top of the page. [User research on the home page](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/public-websites/research/202104-baseline-wayfinding/research-readout-full-June8.pdf) has shown that other tasks are more challenging to do when starting from the home page. 
We would like to learn which tasks Veterans find most important.

### OCTO Objectives 

This research supports the following [OCTO objectives](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/strategy#readme): 
- Increase the usage and throughput of VA services

### Veteran Journey
Veteran tasks fit into the [Veteran journey](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/design/va-product-journey-maps/Veteran%20Journey%20Map.pdf) throughout 
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life 
- Retiring and aging 

## Research Goals	
The goal of this research is to get feedback on the use of a card sort designed to identify Veteran top tasks. We want to get feedback on the cards, categories, and instructions before launching the unmoderated card sort to a large group of Veterans and Caregivers. 

### Outcome
The feedback we get on the card sort will be used to refine it to better prepare for people to use it unmoderated.

### Research questions
1. When Veterans contact the VA, what tasks are most important to them? 
2. What tasks are least important? 
3. Are there any tasks in the card sort that are unclear or confusing?
4. Are there any important tasks missing?
5. Is there anything about the card sort that is unclear or confusing?

### Hypotheses
1. Veterans and caregivers of Veterans will find the card sort intuitive to use.
2. Veterans and caregivers of Veterans will be able to assess the importance of each of the VA-related tasks presented in the card sort.

## Method: Moderated Sessions over Zoom	
We will conduct remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Research participants will be asked about their VA-related tasks, and then they will be given a card sort activity link to do while talking aloud.

The card sort will be built in Optimal Workshop and will contain a list of about 30 tasks that have been synthesized from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches. In the card sort, participants will rate the importance of each task for themselves only (not for all Veterans) by sorting it into one of several fixed categories (i.e., very important, somewhat important, not important, I don't understand this task). They will also be able to add new tasks and sort them, as well.

*Action item: Synthesize and remove duplicates from tasks collected to get down to a list of ~30 tasks.*

*Action item: Get access to the new VSA account for Optimal Workshop from Yana or Shawna, and create a card sort.*
