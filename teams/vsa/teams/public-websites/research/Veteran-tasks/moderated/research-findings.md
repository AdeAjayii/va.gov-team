# Research Goals
We would like to learn which VA-related tasks are most important to Veterans and caregivers so that these tasks can be best supported from the VA.gov home page. The goal of this research was to **get feedback from Veterans and others** (including Veterans' family members or caregivers, survivors, and service members) **on a survey designed to identify Veteran top tasks**. We wanted to get feedback on the tasks, questions, and instructions before launching the unmoderated survey to a large group of Veterans and others to complete independently (without a researcher present).

Veteran tasks fit into the Veteran journey throughout their lives:
- Starting up (Serving in and separating from the military)
- Living civilian life
- Retiring and aging

# Research Questions

1. When Veterans and others contact the VA, what tasks are most important to them?
1. How many tasks do Veterans and others identify as important to themselves?
1. What tasks are least important?
1. Are there any tasks in the survey that are unclear or confusing?
1. Are there any important tasks missing from the survey?
1. Is there anything about the survey that is unclear or confusing?_Research questions here_

# Methodology 

We conducted remote moderated research sessions via Zoom. Research participants were asked about VA-related tasks that they do, and then were given an online survey link to do while sharing their web browser screen and talking aloud.

The online survey was built in Optimal Workshop's survey tool, which is called Questions. The survey contained a list of 41 VA-related tasks that were  synthesized from colleagues, the VA.gov home page, user research studies, and top VA site searches. The [list of tasks](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/public-websites/research/Veteran-tasks/moderated/Task%20List%20for%20Veteran%20Top%20Task%20Research.xlsx) was reviewed by colleagues in IA and Content. In order to keep the list down to a manageable length, some related tasks were combined (e.g., *Learn about or apply for VA health care*), and a few tasks that are required to be supported were omitted (e.g., *Contact the Veterans Crisis Line*, and *Report harassment that occurred at a VA site or online*).

In the survey, participants were asked to select which VA-related tasks were important to them personally right now (*not* for all Veterans). Participants were also asked if there were any VA-related tasks that were important to them that weren't on the list, and which tasks they do most frequently.


# Hypotheses and Conclusions

1. Veterans and others will find the survey intuitive to use from desktop or mobile.
1. Veterans and others will be able to select which of the VA-related tasks presented in the survey are most important to them.
1. Veterans and others won't find any important tasks missing from the survey.

# Key Findings

_The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form"._
