## Who We Are:

We are a team with responsibilities across VA.gov, including public-facing content, benefit hubs, global menu, onsite search, and Find a VA Form experience.
## Our Current Focus:
*Goals:* 
Increase the use of self-service tools and decrease the time users spend waiting for an outcome. We have two initiatives close to launch: The MVP version of Find a VA Form Search experience, and Yellow Ribbon Participating Schools. 
From a content perspective, we are engaged in a tiered approach to rewriting, redirecting, and (in some cases) retiring content.

## Next 6-8 Weeks
Beginning now- update the benefit hubs content to enforce a maximum of three levels of content. We will also adopt a new navigation strategy for our benefit hubs, to match the left nav updates seen on VAMC Pittsburgh. 
Beginning now- develop a process that will allow stakeholders to manage their changing Rates and us to upload the new Rates as easily as possible. 
We are in technical discovery for Find a VA Form - Form Details Landing pages. The goal is to easily surface form information so that users (Veterans, Caregivers, etc.) can more easily apply for benefits via available online tools or download the correct forms.
DEPO percolating- interim step towards a large initiative for templatizing the benefit hubs, and onsite search “2.0”. 
### Concerns- the need to support unplanned critical initiatives can delay our planned projects. 

## Impact of near-term work on other VSA product teams
Will continue our support for other teams’ initiatives. No breaking changes anticipated with our current initiatives.
