#Velocity for BDEx Team

Velocity is used to help teams predict how much work can be accomplished during a sprint. It is a planning tool and not an indicator of performance in any way. This metric is used to help the team plan work for a sprint, by taking into account the average amount of work able to be completed by the team in a single sprint based on the relative estimates for product backlog items (or, user stories).

| 2 | 3/29-4/11/23 | 13 | 8 | 21 |
| 1 | 3/15-3/28/23 | 11 | 12 | 23 |
