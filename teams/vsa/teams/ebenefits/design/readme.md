## Process

### HCD process
The document below was used for the first 24 moths of VSA. Much of this process and the corresponding resources have been superceded by the VA collaboration cycle.

- [Visual QA / design review readiness checklist](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/design/design-review-checklist.md)

### Collaboration cycle
- [VA Platform site](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/index.html)

### Feature Migration Approach

1. Analyze existing feature
2. Conduct discovery research on existing feature
3. Synthesize analysis and research into lo-fi screens and flows
4. Present synthesis/lo-fi visuals at design review
5. Improve fidelity of screens and flows
6. Provide content for sitewide review
7. Present refined mockups at mid-point review
8. Conduct usability testing
9. Refine/finaize screens and flows
10. Review feature in staging
11. Second usability testing round
12. Review feature in production (if possible)
13. Conduct user acceptance testing
