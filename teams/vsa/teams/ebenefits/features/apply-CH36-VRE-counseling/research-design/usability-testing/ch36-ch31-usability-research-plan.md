### Goals

#### Background
Content to come...

#### Research questions
- Where and how (what links/navigation) do participants expect to find...?
- Do participants find the information in the feature useful and complete?
- What, if any, other information do participants expect to see?
- What changes are needed to beter present the information?
- What changes would help viewing data in mobile formats (small viewports only)?

#### Hypotheses
Content to come...

### Method
We will engage in moderated usability testing conducted remotely using Zoom. Remote testing is curently to only viable option, but the metod should yield acceptable observations on which to base findings. Participants will be recruited using Perigean. These users will be provided links to UXPin prototypes to review the features. The sessions will be recorded, and observers and notetakers may be in attendance.
