## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. With me are a few colleagues who are helping-out by observing and taking notes. We are part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that is moving some features of the old eBenefits site over to VA.gov. We're learning what veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful for you. Our focus today is the career and education counseling benefits--most people know them as Chapter 31 and Chapter 36.

There are a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 15 -30 minutes. But you can end it at any point--just let me know. We have quite a few things to cover, so to respect your time, I may occasionally break-in to move us to the next item.
- We're not testing **you** in any way--there are no right or wrong answers. We want to hear your thoughts about what we show you so that we can make improvements to VA.gov.
- Please say what's on your mind--good and bad. I will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- Today we'll be working with a prototype of a feature we're developing. Most things we're testing will work, but a lot of what you see isn't functional. But because we're using prototypes, none of your actions will affect your account or any VA information.
- We'd like to record this session. This'll give us a record to use for note-taking. We'll store the recording on a private drive, and it will be deleted when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up
- Would you tell me a little bit about yourself? Your service experience, where you live, general experiences with the VA...
- Have you received VA career counseling or education benefits in the past? What do you know about Chapter 31 or 36?
- How often do you visit the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov?
- **Now we're ready to start.** OK, now could you share your screen with us?

### User screenshares
- Please go to VA.gov (I put a link in the chat box.)
- If you wanted to apply for VA career or education benefits, where would you go to find info about that?

### User goes to prototype
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing. (Clicks on prototype link to CH36/28-8832 form wizard)

We'll be using made-up scenarios that don't necessarily apply to you. In any case you are free to use names and dates from your past--or even fake names and numbers. Nothing will be submitted because this is a test system. However, please don't use real social security numbers--1234567890 should work in those cases.

## Usability tasks
### Task 1 -- User determines if 28-8832 is the correct form | 3 minutes
- Consequetor unum et lorem dolor sit amet
- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Adspicing enem unum pluribus consequetor

#### Things to look for:
- Do users consequetor unum et lorem dolor sit amet?
- Are users selecting the lorem ipsum dolor sit amet?
- Are there any adspicing enem unum pluribus consequetor?

### Task 2 -- User completes the 28-8832/28-1900 unauthenticated | 3 minutes
- Consequetor unum et lorem dolor sit amet
- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Adspicing enem unum pluribus consequetor

#### Things to look for:
- Do users consequetor unum et lorem dolor sit amet?
- Are users selecting the lorem ipsum dolor sit amet?
- Are there any adspicing enem unum pluribus consequetor?

### Task 3 -- User completes the 28-8832/28-1900 authenticated | 3 minutes
- Consequetor unum et lorem dolor sit amet
- Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
- Adspicing enem unum pluribus consequetor

#### Things to look for:
- Do users consequetor unum et lorem dolor sit amet?
- Are users selecting the lorem ipsum dolor sit amet?
- Are there any adspicing enem unum pluribus consequetor?

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here.
- Is there anything you'd like to add--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at--or VA.gov in general?
- Would you consider being involved in future follow-up sessions?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
