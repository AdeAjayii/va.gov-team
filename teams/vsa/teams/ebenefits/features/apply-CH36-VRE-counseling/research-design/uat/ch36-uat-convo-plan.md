## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today.

I have a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 20 to 30 minutes, but you can stop any point--just let me know. 
- If something is confusing, or you run into an issue or problem, please let us know; we are constantly looking for ways to improve our features and tools
- In this call you'll be entering or reviewing personal information.
- We will be using a live VA form--the 28-8832. You are not obligated to complete this form--it won't be sent to VA to until you go all the way through and click the submit button.
