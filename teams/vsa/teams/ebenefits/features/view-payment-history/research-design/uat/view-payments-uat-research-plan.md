**VSA eBenefits Team | December 2020**

#### Background

#### Note regarding UAT

### Goals
- Confirm all form fields and workflows are available

#### Key guiding question
- Can users quickly and easily review their history of VA compensation and pension, and/or education payments?
- Can users quickly and easily find a particular payment within a date range

### Method
We will engage in moderated User Acceptance Testing (UAT) conducted remotely using Zoom. Veterans with a need to add or remove dependents from their disability claims will be recruited, and will be given access to the new 686. Participants will use the form to apply to have their dependents changed. Remote observers and note takers may be in attendance.

#### Success criteria

Users will:
- Enter the form
- Select the desired form actions (workflows)
- Navigate the form
- Upload documents as needed
- Review and submit form
- Form will successfully submit to BGS for processing

#### The process

- There will be a quick introduction to UAT
- The user will log-in to VA.gov using ID.me
- The participant will be guided to the View Payment History feature
- The user will review their payment historyf and confirm it is correct and up-to-date
- If there is more than one six payments, the participant will be asked to locate a payment from an older date range
- If there are retuned payments, the user will be asked to confirm these are accurate and up-to-date
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up 
- Success will be measured as 80% of participants can successfully submit their 686, with the remaining 20% having a straight-forward remediation path

### Participants & recruiting
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require Veterans who have a need to add or remove a dependent (or dependents) form their VA disability claim. Sessions will run between 30 and 45 minutes depending on the workflow, and potential technical issues; sessions should be scheduled for 45 minutes, and at least 30 minutes apart.

Recruit for a **minimum of 3** fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:

#### Must have for participants

- Do you have verified disability rating of greater than 30%? (pass = yes)
- Do you need to submit a 21-686c (or 21-674) to do one or more of the following (pass = yes):
  - Add a spouse
  - Add a child
  - Add a child (age 18 to 23) who is about to enroll or has enrolled in college (or other training/schools)
  - Remove a divorced spouse
  - Remove a deceased dependent (parent, spouse or child)
  - Remove a married child (under 18)
  - Remove a child (age 18 to 23) who has left school
- Are you LOA3 (identity verified) on VA.gov? (pass = yes) 
  - This can be confirmed by having users sign into VA.gov with any of their credentials and having them go to the VA.gov profile. 

#### Good to have for participants

- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 person of color
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
