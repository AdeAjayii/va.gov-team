## Feature background
Veterans need to stay current with VA regarding the status of their dependents. Currnetly, Veterans are asked to update their dependents by mailed paper letter only every 8 years. This results in a very low quality feedback loop of what dependents are intended to be on award. Using existing Diary Entries, we can determine if the Veteran needs to update their verification and show them a list of their dependents and ask if they are correct. If they are correct, we submit a 21-0538 on thier behalf that will route through Centralized Mail and update their Diary Entry to ask again in 1 year. Else, the Veteran is given an iopportunity to update their dependents if needed.
