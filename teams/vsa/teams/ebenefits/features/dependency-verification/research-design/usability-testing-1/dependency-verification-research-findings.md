## Research Goals 

The primary goal of this study was to assess the effectivness of the intercept modal in prompting users to verify or update their dependents. Secondarily, we wanted to asses:
User acceptance of the modal inteception method
How easily users located the option to add or remove dependents
How clear and helpful the text was
If the user understood what their next steps were

OCTO-DE goals that this supports are:
Logged-in users have a personalized experience, with relevant and time-saving features
- Logged-in users can update their personal information easily and instantly
- Usage of digital, self-service tools

## Research Methodology 

We conducted task-based remote moderated usability testing via Zoom using the Perigean contract. Testing was completed using staging.va.gov. A backup prototype was available in case there was an issue with the staging enviornment.

### Research Questions
What are users reactions to the appearance of the intercept modal? Do they understand what is happening?
Why do participants think they're being asked to confirm their dependents? Do they know what could happen if their dependents list is not up to date?
What do users think happens when they click and choose the "confirm" path?
Can participants identify their options when they click and choose the "change" path?
What do users expect will happen when they choose to remove a dependent? Add a dependent?
