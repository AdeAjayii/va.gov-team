# Dependency verification usability testing research plan
**VSA eBenefits Team | May 2021**

### Background

Veterans receiving disability payments from VA can claim additional compensation for any dependents they might have. Dpendents could include a spouse, children and/or dependent parents. Because family situations often change, VA requires the Veteran to notify them when a family member leaves the household. This happens through divorce, death, leaving school and a few other circustances. One consequence of not reporting dependent changes in a timely manner, is the Veteran could incur a debt with VA. 

To short circuit this issue, the eBenefits team has created an intercept modal resiing o the View Dependents page. Veterans must log in to see this screen, and when they navigate to the dependents page, a check will occur against a notification date. The modal will prompt the Veteran to review the VA record of their dependents, and will be asked to add or remove dependents if necessary.

### Goals

The goal of this usability study is to determine the efectiveness of the intercept modal in prompting users to confirm or change their dependents. Secondarily, we want to gauge user acceptance of this notification method, as well as how easily users locate the "add" and "remove" dependents features. Last, we want to determine if the text presented is clear and helpful, and if the user understands what their next steps are.


#### Guiding questions
- What are users reactions to the appearance of the intercept modal? Do they understand what is happening?
- Why do users think they're being asked to confirm their dependents? Do they know what could happen if their dependents are wrong?
- What do users think happens when they click and choose the "confirm" path?
- Can users identify their options when they click and choose the "change" path?
- What do users expect will happen when they choose to remove a dependent? Add a dependent?

<!--

#### Guiding questions
- Starting on the VA.gov home page, where do users expect to find the COE tool, and what path do they take?
- How do users feel about the "automatic COE" feature; what are their expections about it future availability (access, printing, download)?
- What barriers int the UX and UI prevent users from easily applying for a COE?
- Where does confusing language prevent users from understanding the form?
- Where (on VA.gov and elsewhere) do users expect to have their COE available after it has been granted?
- What other features or content would help users when they apply for a COE?

#### Hypotheses
- Users will initially look for a direct link in the whit quadrant on the home page; many will locate COE landing page after several steps
- The form itself will be relatively easy for users to navigate
- Biographical, contact and service language will be clear to most users; the language around loan options and COE intent will be somewhat confusing
- Users will expect their COE to be available in various ways: physical letter, email, printed, and/or within an authenticated profile/dashboard
- Users will ask for directly available information (chat, direct phone, lookups) about the COE, lenders and /or realtors

### Method
We'll engage in moderated usability testing conducted remotely using Zoom. Users will be given open-ended "tasks" set forth in a coversation guide, and their actions and feedback will be recorded. Participants will be recruited using Perigean. These users will be asked to explore VA.gov (home), then will be provided links to a prototype of the COE feature (VA From 26-1880). The prototype is likely to include some facsimile of the landing page. Users will be given open-ended "tasks" set forth in a coversation guide, and their actions and feedback will be recorded. Observers and notetakers may be in attendance.

#### The process
- There will be a quick warm-up and introduction to usability testing
- The user will be asked to navigate to VA.gov 
- The moderator will outline a scenario (use case) for the participant to follow
- The participant be will asked to locate the COE feature
- After a brief period exploring a path to the COE tool, the users will be provided a link to the COE prototype
- The user will potentially proceed through review of the form intro and on to complete the form itself
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up
