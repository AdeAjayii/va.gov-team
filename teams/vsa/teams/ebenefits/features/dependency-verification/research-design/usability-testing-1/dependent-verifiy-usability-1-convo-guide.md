* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute
* In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked
* Sessions will be conducted remotely, setup will be tested 15 minutes prior to call-time; users will be required to share their screen
* **Note:** These sessions will be recorded
* [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/dependency-verification/research-design/usability-testing-1/dependent-verifiy-usability-1-research-plan.md) 

## Intro - 5 minutes
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. My name is {NAME} and I have a few colleagues on the line with us. They are here to help me out by observing and taking notes. We're part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that's moving some features off the old eBenefits site and over to VA.gov. To do that, we really want to learn what Veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful. Today, we're looking at how you view and update your dependents.

There are a few things I need to mention before we start:
* The session should take about 25 minutes, but you can end it at any point--just let me know. 
* We have quite a few things to cover, so to respect your time, I may occasionally break-in to move us to the next item on the list.
* We're not testing **you** in any way--so there really are no right or wrong answers. We'd like to hear exactly what you think about what we show you so we can make improvements to VA.gov.
* Please say what's on your mind--good and bad. Any problem you have or confusion you experience is significant and helps us identify areas where we need to improve. I will not be offended by any opinions you express.
* Today we'll be working with an early version of a feature we're developing. Most things we're testing will work, but some might not. But because it's not a live web page, none of your actions will affect your account or any VA information.
* We'd like to record this session. This'll give us a record to use for note-taking. The recording will be stored on a private drive and deleted when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
* If yes, I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.

[Start Recording]

* OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up questions - 5 minutes
* Would you tell us a little bit about yourself? Your service experience, where you live, general experiences with the VA...
* Have you ever had to add or remove a dependent from your VA benefits? How did you do that?
* How often do you use the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov?
* **Now we're ready to start.** OK, now could you share your screen with us? There should be a green button at the bottom of your Zoom screen that says "Share Screen" - just click that, select your screen, and hit share.

<!--
## Wayfinding - 3 minutes
### User screenshares 
* Before we go to the prototype we're testing, we'll take a quick look at VA.gov
* **Please go to VA.gov.**
* If you were told VA.gov was the place to review your dependents, where would you look on the site?
* This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

#### Things to look for:
* What is the user's thought process?
* What interactive elements does the user look for (e.g. menu, links, footer...)?
* What content/section does the user expect to have career and education benefits?  -->

## Usability tasks
User goes to prototype link
* For the purpose of this test, we'll have you use a prototype. 
* Now I have a link in chat to the page we're testing; **please click on it.** (Clicks on link to View Dependents prototype )

### Task 1 -  Identify dependents  - 1 minute     
`I think we would need a landing page to start this task on… or is there some other way to word this that makes it clear to the participant that they have navigated to the view dependents screen already?`
* If you wanted to be sure that your dependents were covered on your account, where would you check?
* Can you tell me the names of the dependents on this account?

#### Things to look for:
* Do users recognize they’ve been intercepted by a modal?
* Why do users think they are being asked to confirm their dependents?
* What is the users’ perception of what the modal is telling them and what options are available?

### Task 2 - Locate update dependents  - 3 minutes
* Imagine that, as you look at this list, you realize that this list is not correct.
* How would you update your dependents? 

#### Things to look for:
* Do users identify the “continue” button as a way to make updates?

### Task 3 - Remove a dependent - 2 minutes
* Imagine that your child aged out of benefits a few months ago.
* How would you notify the VA that {name from prototype} should no longer be on your account? 
* Probe after they choose a path: Why is it important to update your dependents?
* What would you expect to happen now?

#### Things to look for:
* Does the user find the “remove dependent” button?
* If user had chosen “no changes” on the previous screen, do they look for a way to return to the modal?
* Do users understand what could happen if their dependents are wrong?
* What do users expect will happen after they remove a dependent? 

### Task 4 - Add a dependent - 2 minutes
* Imagine that you now have a step-child living with you and you would like to see if they can receive benefits.
* How would you notify the VA that you have a new dependent?
* Probe after they finish task: - What would you expect to happen now?

#### Things to look for:
* Does the user find the “add dependent” button?
* What do users expect will happen after they add a dependent? 

### Task 5 - Alt path from Modal / 2 minutes
* Let’s return to that screen where you were first presented with a list of dependents. 
* What would you do here if this list was correct?
* Probe if not answered in previous tasks:
* Why does the participant think they were being asked to confirm their dependents?

#### Things to look for:
* What does the user expect to happen when they click the “no change” button?

## Final thoughts
* If this were an actual application, what would expect to happen next?
* What on the site would you do/look at next?
* Did you notice any differences between the “No change” and “continue” screens? 
* How could we make things more clear?

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
