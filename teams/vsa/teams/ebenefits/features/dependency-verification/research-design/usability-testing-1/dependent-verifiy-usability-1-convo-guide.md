* Before the session, send out the [observer instructions](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/research/during-research/howto-observer-instructions.md) to your observers (Slackbot will do this for you if you type "observer instructions" into [\#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel)).
* In the Attendees section, make sure everyone except the participant is on mute
* In the Audio section, click the drop-down arrow and make sure "Play Entry/Exit Chimes" is unchecked
* Sessions will be conducted remotely, setup will be tested 15 minutes prior to call-time; users will be required to share their screen
* **Note:** These sessions will be recorded
* [Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/dependency-verification/research-design/usability-testing-1/dependent-verifiy-usability-1-research-plan.md) 

## Intro - 5 minutes
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. My name is {NAME} and I have a few colleagues on the line with us. They are here to help me out by observing and taking notes. We're part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that's moving some features off the old eBenefits site and over to VA.gov. To do that, we really want to learn what Veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful. Today, we're looking at how you view and update your dependents.

There are a few things I need to mention before we start:
* The session should take about 25 minutes, but you can end it at any point--just let me know. 
* We have quite a few things to cover, so to respect your time, I may occasionally break-in to move us to the next item on the list.
* If you have participated in a usability test before, this should be pretty similar. And, if you haven’t, it’s pretty simple. I will give you a little backstory and then ask you to complete a few tasks based on that scenario.
* I do want to stress that we are testing ourselves and not **you** in any way. There are no right or wrong answers. We'd like to hear exactly what you think about what we show you so we can make improvements to VA.gov.
* Please say what's on your mind--good and bad. Any problem you have or confusion you experience is significant and helps us identify areas where we need to improve. I will not be offended by any opinions you express.
* Today we'll be working with an early version of a feature we're developing. Most things we're testing will work, but some might not. This is not a live web page, so none of your actions will affect your account or any VA information.
* We'd like to record this session. This gives us a record to use for note-taking. The recording will be stored on a private drive and deleted when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
* If yes, I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.

[Start Recording]

* OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up Questions - 5 minutes
* Would you tell us a little bit about yourself? Your service experience, where you live, general experiences with the VA...
* Have you used eBenefits to make changes to your dependents?
* (If user has disability rating) Would you mind telling us what your disability rating is?
* How often do you visit the eBenefits site? How about VA.gov?
* **Now we're ready to start.** OK, now could you share your screen with us? There should be a green button at the bottom of your Zoom screen that says "Share Screen" - just click that, select your screen, and hit share.


## Usability tasks
* For the purpose of this test, we'll have you use a prototype. 
* Now I have a link in chat to the page we're testing; **please click on it.** (Clicks on link to View Dependents prototype )



### Scenario 1 -  Verify dependents  - 10 minutes     
For the first task, I would like you to imagine that you have three dependents, a spouse (Pat) and two children (Jordan and Logan). You are on VA.gov to look at information about getting a home loan, but while you are on the site, you remember that Logan needs a physical before the next school year starts. You want to make sure your child is eligible. 
#### Task 1
Check your dependents
* Can you tell me who is listed as your dependents?

##### Things to look for:
* Do users recognize they’ve been intercepted by a modal?
* Why do users think they are being asked to confirm their dependents?
* What is the users’ perception of what the modal is telling them and what options are available?
* What does the user expect to happen when they click the “verify this is correct” button?

#### Task 2 (If the user does not proceed on their own)
Verify that Logan’s birthdate is July 7, 2007. 

##### Things to look for:
* Does the user use the “Verify dependents” button or try to bypass the modal in another way?
* What does the user expect to happen now?



### Scenario 2 - Update Dependents  - 10 minutes
That was great. Thank you. Let’s go back to the beginning. (User clicks on link again)

This time, I would like you to imagine that some time has passed, a year or so. During the past year, you’ve had some life changes - Jordan aged out of benefits and you adopted another child (Taylor). You are back on VA.gov to schedule a hearing test for yourself and you realize that it has been awhile since you updated your dependents. You would like to check them again.

#### Task 3
Check your dependents. 

##### Things to look for:
* Do users identify the “add or remove dependents” button as a way to make updates?
* Do users understand what could happen if their dependents are wrong?

#### Task 4  (If the user does not proceed on their own)
Update your dependents to remove Jordan.
* After user clicks “Remove dependent” link: This is where we run into a feature we haven’t prototyped yet. What would you expect to happen now?
 
##### Things to look for:
* Note: The link for this will not work
* Does the user use the “add or remove dependents” button or try to bypass the modal in another way?
* Does the user find the “remove dependent” link?
* What do users expect will happen after they remove a dependent? 


#### Task 5
Add Taylor to your dependents
* After user clicks “Add dependents to your VA benefits” action link: And this is the other feature that we haven’t prototyped out. What would you expect to happen here?

##### Things to look for:
* Note: The link for this will not work
* Does the user find the “add dependent” button?
* What do users expect will happen after they add a dependent? 



## Final thoughts
* If this were an actual application, what would expect to happen next?
* What on the site would you do/look at next?
* Did you notice any differences between the “Verify” and “Update” screens? 
* How could we make things more clear?

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
