## Feature Summary
The 686 form is complex. Comprised of up to 8 distinct workflows, the amount of time a user may spend completing a single application can be considerable. 
In thinking about future iterations of the 686, one of the questions we needed to answer was: "How can we reduce cognitive and temporal burden on our users?".
A solution we settled on was providing a formlett on the view dependents page that allows uesrs to remove dependents from their accounts without entering the 686 form itself. 

## Technical implementation
- Formletts are housed in the [ManageDependentsApp](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/c6d3a434f04c83cd5048f2b5f75282abb3726867/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/containers/ManageDependentsApp.jsx#L1) and are embedded in [ViewDependentsListItem](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/805f2dbd5816d992130dbd62baef2833335ab6f7/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/components/ViewDependentsList/ViewDependentsListItem.jsx#L106) components for each person on award.
- Formletts are built with json-schema-form and are located [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/5e7c79ebf3e03c5c9d4b9d96f77f515699b5c811/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/schemas.js#L1).
- State relies on redux, and formlett submission is done asynchronously in an action called [submitFormData](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/c6d3a434f04c83cd5048f2b5f75282abb3726867/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/redux/actions.js#L29). 
- The [onSubmit handler](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/c6d3a434f04c83cd5048f2b5f75282abb3726867/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/containers/ManageDependentsApp.jsx#L30) tranforms the payload so it conforms to the existing 686 form schema. That [transformer](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/4e650b570f2eef9d8c3434ac798d00163358e974/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/utils/index.js#L195) calls an [adapter](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/4e650b570f2eef9d8c3434ac798d00163358e974/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/utils/index.js#L92) that handles the work of mapping formlett payload properties to the correct 686 schema form properties. 
- The original 686 form schema is located [here](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-json-schema/blob/f98b17ebbf3e351a8a306a8511567acc039b4689/src/schemas/686c-674/schema.js#L18)
- Veteran information is pulled from the user object and is transformed to fit the 686 form schema using [this adapter](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-website/blob/4e650b570f2eef9d8c3434ac798d00163358e974/src/applications/personalization/view-dependents/manage-dependents/utils/index.js#L32)
