# Research plan for user acceptability testing (UAT) for Form 21-686c / staging environment
**VSA eBenefits Team | August 2020**

#### Background
VA uses the 21-686c (686) form to collect and process the information to allow a Veteran to add dependents to their disability claim. The same form is used to remove dependents who have left the household of the Veteran (death, divorce, marriage). The eBenefits team will conduct Acceptance Testing (UAT) ahead of launch, then closely monitor analytics to ensure the form is generating viable submissions across all 686 workflows.

### Goals
- Confirm all form fields and workflows are available
- Confirm form collects data and advances as expected
- Confirm data successfully submits as input
- Confirm status of dependency claim properly displays in claim status tool

#### Key guiding question
Can users quickly and easily add and/or remove dependents from their disability claim?

### Method
We will engage in moderated User Acceptance Testing (UAT) conducted remotely using Zoom. Veterans with a need to add or remove dependents from their disability claims will be recruited, and will be given access to the new 686. Participants will use the form to apply to have their dependents changed. Remote observers and note takers may be in attendance.

#### Success criteria

Users will:
- Enter the form
- Select the desired form actions (workflows)
- Navigate the form
- Upload documents as needed
- Review and submit form
- Form will successfully submit to BGS for processing

#### The process

- There will be a quick introduction to UAT
- The participant will be guided to the 686 intro
- The user will proceed through the 686 and submit
- Participants will be advised as to what expect during processing
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up 
- Success will be measured as 80% of participants can successfully submit their 686, with the remaining 20% having a straight-forward remediation path

### Participants & recruiting
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require Veterans who have a need to add or remove a dependent (or dependents) form their VA disability claim. Sessions will run between 30 and 45 minutes depending on the workflow, and potential technical issues; sessions should be scheduled for 45 minutes, and at least 30 minutes apart.

Recruit for a **minimum of 3** fulfilled sessions using the following criteria:

#### Must have for participants

- Do you have verified disability rating of greater than 30%? (pass = yes)
- Do you need to submit a 21-686c (or 21-674) to do one or more of the following (pass = yes):
  - Add a spouse
  - Add a child
  - Add a child (age 18 to 23) who is about to enroll or has enrolled in college (or other training/schools)
  - Remove a divorced spouse
  - Remove a deceased dependent (parent, spouse or child)
  - Remove a married child (under 18)
  - Remove a child (age 18 to 23) who has left school
- Are you LOA3 (identity verified) on VA.gov? (pass = yes) 
  - This can be confirmed by having users sign into VA.gov with any of their credentials and having them go to the VA.gov profile. 

#### Good to have for participants

- At least 1 woman
- At least 1 person of color
- At least 1 participant 35 or under and 1 participant over 55
- At least one person that does not have a college degree (to include enlisted Vets)
- At least one person that has a college degree (to include of officer Vets)
- At least one person who lives in a rural or remote area
- At least one person who lives in a major metropolitan area

#### Recruitment requirements

- The participants have Zoom downloaded prior to the session
- The participants know how to screenshare

**Note:** we do not expect to cover every scenario in the "Must have" criteria above. Priority scenarios are (in order):
- Add a spouse
- Add a child
- Add a child (age 18 to 23) who is about to enroll or has enrolled in college (or other training/schools)
- Remove a divorced spouse
- All others

**Important:** Certain scenarios will require the participants to gather information or documents. If possible, participants should review form instructions (will be provided) ahead of their UAT session.
