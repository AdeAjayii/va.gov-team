# Research plan for user acceptability testing (UAT) for Form 21-686c / staging environment
**VSA eBenefits Team | August 2020**

#### Background
VA uses the 21-686c (686) form to collect and process the information to allow a Veteran to add dpendents to their disability claim. The same form is used to remove dependents who have left the household of the Veteran (death, divorce, marriage). The eBenefits team will conduct Acceptance Testing (UAT) ahead of launch, then closely monitor analytics to ensure the form is generating viable submissions across all 686 workflows.

### Goals
Our primary goal is to determine user acceptance of the new implementation of the 21-686c (686) form on VA.gov. 

#### Key guiding question
Can users quickly and easily add and/or remove dependents from their disability claim?

### Method
We will engage in moderated User Acceptance Testing (UAT) conducted remotely using Zoom. Veterans with a need to add or remove dependents from their disability claims will be recruited, and will be given access to the new 686. Participants will use the form to apply to have their dependents changed. Remote observers and note takers may be in attendance.

#### Success crieteria

Users will:
- Enter the form
- Select the desired form actions (workflows)
- Navigate the form
- Upload documents as needed
- Review and submit form
- Form will successfully submit to BGS for processing

#### The process

- There will be a quick introduction to UAT
- The participant will be guided to the 686 intro
- The user will proceed through the 686 and submit
- Participants will be advised as to what expect during processing
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up 
- Success will be measured as 80% of participants can successfully submit their 686, with the remaining 20% having a straight-forward remediation path

### Participants & recruiting
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require eight (8) Veterans from a range of service backgrounds. Participant criteria include:

- Must have verified disability rating of greater than 30%
- The Veteran needs to sumbit a 21-686c (or 21-674) to do one or more of the following:
  - Add a spouse
  - Add a child
  - Add a child (age 18 to 23) who is about to enroll or has enrolled in college (or other training/schools)
  - Remove a divorced spouse
  - Remove a deceased dependent (parent, spouse or child)
  - Remove a married child (under 18)
  - Remove a child (age 18 to 23) who has left school
- Must be LOA3 (identity verified) on VA.gov. 
  - This can be confirmed by having users sign into VA.gov with any of their credentials and having them go to the VA.gov profile. If they can see the profile, they are LOA3 and can participate in testing.
- Must be able to screen-share via Zoom; if the user is unable to screen-share due to platform or technical issues, they cannot participate
- All genders
- Several Veterans (3 to 4) with Total Rated Disability of 80% or greater and cognitive disabilities
- Sessions will run between 15 and 30 minutes

Note: we do not expect to cover every scenario in the criteria above. Priority order is:
- Add a spouse
- Add a child
- Add a child (age 18 to 23) who is about to enroll or has enrolled in college (or other training/schools)
- Remove a divorced spouse
- All others
