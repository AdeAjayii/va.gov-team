### Goals
Our primary goal is to determine user acceptance of the new implementation of the 21-686c (686) form on VA.gov. 

#### Key guiding question
Can users quickly and easily add and/or remove dependents from their disability claim?

### Method
We will engage in moderated User Acceptance Testing (UAT) conducted remotely using Zoom. Veterans with a need to add or remove dependents from their disability claims will be recruited, and will be given access to the new 686. Participants will use the form to apply to have their dependents changed. Remote observers and note takers may be in attendance. (Do we provide pre-test guidance regarding instructions or uploads?)

#### The process

- There will be a quick introduction to UAT
- The session will begin recording
- The participant will be guided to the 686 intro (or will we drop them onto the home screen?)
- The user will proceed through the 686 and submit
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up 
  - (Will we need to have 'stand-by plans" for catastrophic failure?)
  - (Can we give assurances or follow-up paths?)
  - (Will we shepherd the application through and connect with the LOB?)
  - (Will we offer support for failed submissions?)
  - (who would run point on problems generated by the form process?)
  - (Etcetera)
- Success will be measured as 80% of participants can successfully submit their 686, with the remaining 20% having a straight-forward remediation path

### Participants & recruitment
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require eight (8) Veterans from a range of service backgrounds. Participant criteria include:

- Must have verified disability rating of greater than 30%
- Fits one of the following; participant needs to:
  - Add a child
  - Add a spouse
  - Add a child (age 18 to 23) who is about to enroll or has enrolled in college (or other training/schools)
  - Remove a divorced spouse
  - Remove a deceased dependent (parent, spouse or child)
  - Remove a married child (under 18)
  - Remove a child (age 18 to 23) who has left school
- Must be LOA3 (identity verified) on VA.gov. 
  - This can be confirmed by having users sign into VA.gov with any of their credentials and having them go to the VA.gov profile. If they can see the profile, they are LOA3 and can participate in testing.
- Must be able to screen-share via Zoom; if the user is unable to screen-share due to platform or technical issues, they cannot participate
- All genders
- Several Veterans (3 to 4) with Total Rated Disability of 80% or greater and cognitive disabilities
- Sessions will run between 15 and 30 minutes
