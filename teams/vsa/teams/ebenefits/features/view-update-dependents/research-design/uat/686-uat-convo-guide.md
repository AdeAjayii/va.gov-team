### Setup
- Slack [#feedback-backchannel](https://dsva.slack.com/channels/feedback-backchannel) will be used for real-time feedback from observers
- Sessions will be conducted remotely, setup will be tested 15 minutes prior to call-time
- [Associated Research Plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/ebenefits/features/view-update-dependents/research-design/uat/686-uat-research-plan.md)

## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today.

I have a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 15 to 30 minutes, but you can stop any point--just let me know. You are not obligated to complete the form--it won't go to until you go all the way through and click the submit button.
- Today we'll be testing a new feature we've depeloped for VA.gov. It's live and will send VA a 21-686c when you submit.
[ Can we record UAT? ]
- We'd like to record this session. This will give a record to use for note-taking. We'll store the recording on a private drive, and it will be deleted when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.
- OK, now that I'm recording, do I have your permission to record this session?
