## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today.

I have a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 15 to 30 minutes, but you can stop any point--just let me know. 
- If something is confusing or you run into an issue or problem, please let us know; we are constantly looking for ways to improve our features and tools
- You are not obligated to complete the form--it won't go to until you go all the way through and click the submit button.

## Warm-up/screening

OK,let's get started.

First, can you tell me a little bit about yourself and your experience with VA? (If stuck, prompt to ask about service experience, where they live, their work).

You'll be working with a new feature we have on VA.gov: VA form 21-686c, the one you use to add or remove dependents from your disability claim. I have a few questions to be sure this form is right for you:
- I need to confirm: do you have at least a 30% disability rating with VA?
  - If the user does not have at least a 30% disability rating, end the session.
- Can you confirm for me that you have a DS Logon, MyHealtheVet, or ID.me account? And do you know your username and password? 
  - If not: Are these easy to get? Could get you them?
  - If the user can not remember or retrieve their login credentials, end the session.
- And next, do you need to add or remove a dependent from your disability claim? 
  - If not end the session.
  - (Some workflows/situation require documenation) Since you need to X, you may need to upload documentation. Do you have this handy? 
  - (is there a provision for providing documentation after submittling the form?)

Good! The next questions are about your computer and browser.
- Can you tell me what type of computer you are using today?
  - I ask this because sometimes the type of computer can affect your experience with the tools. Knowing which one you are using will help our developers make adjustments if needed.
- Can you tell me which web browser you are using? Are you OK using Chrome?

Today we are going to observe you completing a 21-686c. We're nopt recording this session, but we need to see your screen as you move through the form. Would you feel comfortable sharing your screen at this time?
- If no: Explain this is necesary for testing. If they are still unwilling (e.g. because of personal info), end the call.

OK, please share your screen, and then we will get started.
