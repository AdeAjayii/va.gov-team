## Goals
The goal of this research is to understand user comprehension of the existing Power of Attorney Feature and user Payment History practices in eBenefits, as part of the digital eBenefits migration to the VA.gov website. This includes:

### 686 Business:
The over-arching business goal of the 686 is the quick automatic processing of the greatest number of digitally submitted forms. To support this, the new digital version of the form must be as clear and succinct as possible to increase accuracy and reduce abandonment. For users, the 686 is a potentially long and convoluted form; it is imperative to minimize potential confusion and consolidate the form's flow.

### Determine if users understand and accept the multi-purpose structure of the form
 - Observe users' interactions with workflows and combinations not tested in the prototype usability sessions (death, child marriage, divorce, etc.)
 - Observe how users interact with the form review accordions

#### Decide what support users need to navigate and successfully submit the form
 - Determine what instructions, guidance and examples will be helpful within form workflows not tested in the prototype usability sessions (death, child marriage, divorce, etc.)
  - Note any potential problems with list/loop feature

### Determine if users identify cases requiring additional documentation
 - Confirm that introductory text informs users about upload requirements and what scenarios call for uploads
 - Assess users' understanding of "tell-me-more" accordions in workflows requiring uploaded documentation
 - Assess users' understanding of the upload process, and it's placement within workflows

### Discover any problems that arise from longer/complicated chapter combinations
 - Determine potential issues with particular flows: 
   - Add-spouse/report-divorce
   - Add-spouse/add-child workflow combinations
   - Add-child/add-student workflow combinations
   - Report-divorce/remove-stepchild workflow combinations

## Research questions
1. Are the form instructions clear and complete? Will users know what documents and info they will need to complete the form?
2. Do participants understand how the 21-686c works as a multi-purpose form?
3. What are the "sticking points" in the various form workflows? What workflow combinations cause users problems (add-spouse/add-child, add-child/add-student, add spouse/report divorce)?
4. Where do users need examples, more guidance or improved section headers as they interact with the form?
5. Will users understand when and how to upload additional documentation?
6. How will users interact with the form review accordions?
7. Is the information on the confirmation page clear and complete?
8. Can users complete the longer scenarios in a timely manner (per OMB timeframe)?

**Additional Questions**<br/>
9. What are users' experiences with dependents on their VA benefits, and the current 21-686c (paper, digital, VSO, etc.)?<br/>
10. What workflow combinations (scenarios) do users consider likely?<br/>
11. Where in VA.gov would users expect to find the 21-686c?<br/>

## Hypotheses
1. The paper version of the 686 is long and complicated, but the digital version should prove easy to use because it features user-selectable workflows and "step-by-step" chapter-based screens; however the form review accordions will prove challenging to participants because of page depth, and the potentially large number of section in longer workflows
2. Users will only scan the introduction screen, and will require additional clarification or guidance at various points (e.g. VA file number, dates within 674, financial questions)
3. Upload scenarios and requirements will need greater clarification. the actual upload process itself will be quick and easy, but users will be frustrated by having to scan/find documents.
4. Combination workflows will be long but relatively easy for users; the divorce plus stepchild combination may be problematic since it's long and requires detailed (potentially emotionally-charged) information.

## Success
This research effort will be successful if it gives clear indications regarding the usability of the 21-686c (and 21-674) form flows so that final refinement can be made before product launch. Specifically, several things need to be determined:
 - Will users understand and accept the multi-purpose nature of the form
 - What guidance (instructional text, headers, etc.) will users need to support successful completion of the form
 - Will users understand when additional information is required; and how to upload it
 - Are there any workflow combinations that would be problematic for users due to length and/or information detail required

## Method
Usability testing will be conducted remotely using Zoom. Participants will be provided login credentials to a test account that will support their designated scenarios. These users will be given situations and a set tasks to perform. Workflows and tasks may be broken into separate groups, so users may run through the form multiple times. The moderator will guide and prompt users; observers and note-takers will document issues the participant encounter, as well as noting sections that users navigated easily.

This methodology allows for direct observation of users interactions with a near-final product. This will allow the team to capture real-time feedback on a "live" product.

## Participants and recruitment
Participants will be recruited via Perigean. The study will require 14 Veterans from a variety of service backgrounds. These participants will be divided into two groups of seven (+/-). Each group will be give a set of scenarios/tasks to complete using the form. This will allow full coverage of all workflows. Criteria include:

### All participants
- 14 participants will be scheduled by Perigean
- All genders
- Computer access and basic computer literacy
- Total Rated Disability of 30% or greater
- Several Veterans (4+) with Total Rated Disability of 80% or greater and cognitive disabilities
- Sessions will run approximately 60 minutes
- We request that Perigean provide a note taker for all the sessions

### Group 1
- Fits any of the following:
  - Have or had dependents; received or applied for dependents benefits
  - Has recently been married/divorced
  - Has experienced dependent status change such as, marriage, death, leaving school
- Workflows for Group 1
  - Add spouse/Report divorce
  - Report death
  - Add student
  - Report student left school
  
### Group 2
- Fits any of the following:
  - Have or had dependents; received or applied for dependents benefits
  - Has child (age 18 to 23) who is about to enroll or has enrolled in college
  - Has recently been divorced
- Workflows for Group 2
  - Add spouse/Add child
  - Report death
  - Report marriage of child
  - Report divorce/Remove stepchild

## Key Findings
- The participants would **prefer to first add a dependent** and secondly add the dependent’s details.
- The form's **verbiage was unclear** to participants resulting in:
  - Incomplete steps
  - Dependent(s) not being reported
  - Hesitating to complete the form
  - Soliciting clarification from a VA representative
- The majority of participants thought the forms were **really easy to complete.**
- Participants bypassed the introduction page and had mixed reviews about its usefulness.
- Participants **disliked the length** of the forms because:
  - They felt there were numerous and irrelevant marriage questions. 
  - They felt there were numerous and irrelevant questions about the dependent's schooling.  
  - The VA should already have their contact information.
        
### Additional findings:
- **Veterans are apprehensive** that an incorrect step will result in **punitive finical action** from the VA
- Participants would **prefer accessibility to the entire for** becuase before proceeding to the next step all required field in the step need to me completed.   

## Detailed Findings
**A difference in mental models:**<br/>
The study shows a contrasting approach between how participants wanted to add/update dependents, and the form wants participants to enter dependents information. Participants wanted to add a person first instead of defining how the VA will categorize the dependent.
  > Statement
  
The different approaches disconnect did cause confusion between the participants and the form but, clearer instructions and verbiage could bridge the gap. The participants chose to omit information because they worried inaccurate information might affect them negatively.  However, the participants did like that they could enter multiple applications at once because it saved them time and effort.

**Unclear verbiage:** 
- The lack of clarity in the instructions and tasks was the most substantiated finding. 
- The lack of understanding resulted in:
  - Incomplete steps
  - Unreported dependents
  - Submission of incomplete form
  - Soliciting clarification from a VA representative

Participants' list of additional comments included: 
  - Inconsistency in language, 
  - Confusing language for the checkboxes
  - A lack of comprehensive instructions

"Add" and "Claim" are examples of the inconsistent verbiage.  Using one term consistently would reduce the user's confusion.
  > Statement
  
The step titled "What do you want to do?" was another example of an area in which instructions confused the participants.   Participants were unclear on how to update a child because the instructions did not distinguish between step-child or biological child.
  > Statement
  
If you’re claiming a dependent child 18 to 23 years old who’ll be attending school, and if you never received benefits for this child, you must also select the “Claim benefits for your child under 18” checkbox below. (image)

The checkbox verbiage limited the types of dependent benefits offered by the VA.  Some checkboxes specify "step-child" while others specify "child".   By default, this inadvertently limits the options veterans have to select.  There are no options to choose for a biological 19-year-old going college.  The only 19-year-old college student option is for a 'step-child'.
  > Statement
  
Participants were unclear on what to select when adding multiple children.
  > Statement
  
For step "Information needed to add a student 18 to 23 years old" the instructions did not resonate with participants, unsuccessfully alerted the applicants, and may result in issues when submitting the form.   To rectify the problem, the applicant will have traverse the form.  Two participant was not sure if they needed to restart the form. 

Note: ...... If you never received benefits for this child, be sure you selected the "Claim benefits for your child" checkbox at the beginning of this form.
  > Statement

The Review page's accordion labels confused some participants. Overall most participants understood the purpose of the Review page. However, the participants were not sure about the fist accordion content because of its label "What do you want to do?".
  > Statement
  
The Uploading Document's instructions did define the required documents for a step-child living in the US.
  > Statement
  
The step-child section did not display the same format as other children types. As a result, participants found it more challenging to determine what type of documents are required. IMage
  > Statement

Marriage types: Participants were not sure how the VA defined "ceremony" as a marriage type. They were looking for  "church" and  "courthouse." Other participants remarked that all the marriage types are some type of ceremony.

** Positive Feedback:**
Every participant liked that:
- The form was easy to complete 
- Multiple applications could be completed at once 
- The input titles were clear and easy to understand.
- Error prevention messages were clear and helpful. 
- Required fields were clearly labeled.
  > Statement
  
**The introduction page's usefulness had mixed reviews.** 
- Instruction often was ‘below the fold’ for users
- Users bypass instructions and immediately click CTA button (See image below)
- Few users read the form instructions even when prompted 
- The page was viewed as canned VA statements or boilerplate text
- When the moderator redirected the participants to read the page: 
  - Found information easy to locate
  - Found the information helpful
  > Statement

**Lenght of the form:**
The participants remarked about the process being lengthy and redundant: 
- Reentering previously provided information
- Entering a large amount of detail regarding education
- Providing current spouse's previous marriage details
  > Statement
  
One participant felt the less information entered and reviewed by a "VA Human," would reduce the chance; the form will be flagged. Statement

## Additonal Findings
**Fear of repercussion drives inactions:**
Many participants voiced their opinion that they were hesitant to take any actions that could negatively affect their monthly VA stipend, which they rely on.
  > Statement

**Complete as much of the form in the first pass:**
Participants prefer access to the entire form.  The Form System is structured so each step must be completed in its entirety before continuing to the next step. Once in the form, the system limits the user's ability to know the necessary resources to complete because you can only see one step at a time.  The Form System's piecemeal design negatively affects the application's ability to gather all needed information at once. To submit, the form the user must keep reentering the form until completing each step. Opening up the entire form allows veterans to gather what information they need to complete the form in the least number of attempts.

-This approach to the Form Suystem's design affects the socioeconomic veterans the most because they may."
  - Not have easy access to a computer, 
  - Not have information readily available 
  - Not have transportation to a public computer. 
  
These socioeconomic veterans may also heavily rely on VA services.
