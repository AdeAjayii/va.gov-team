# Background
When a Veteran wants to get a VA backed home loan the VA can provide them with a Certificate of Eligibility, or COE for short. This certificate is does not guarantee approval for a loan or specify any details like loan amounts, it is simply a document that says that the VA says they are eligible for a VA backed home loan.
