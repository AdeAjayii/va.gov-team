## Warm-up
**M:** Okay, for the record, Do I have your permission to record this session?

**P4:** Yes, sir.

**M:** Great. I appreciate that. Alright, to start out with, if you wouldn't mind telling us just a little bit about yourself. I understand that you are a veteran and that you are a veteran caretaker. Could you tell us a bit about your maybe your

**P4:** I joined the service in between my junior and senior year of high school 1979. Left which basic training in March of 80 did my a it came home to Southern southern Indiana, and I wanted to be active duty. So I went active duty for their got out in 95. Desert Storm veteran my husband and I have gotten together to fly 2018 we got married in November of 2018. He is a special forces combat veteran. For my rack. I got my certificate of eligibility. Do I could buy a house? And I finally closed on the house in January of 2014.

## Section one: The loan process
**M:** Oh, okay. So it's, um, it's relatively recently. So that's good. So you have applied for and received a VA loan, you've gone through the process. So there's that that puts you in a good spot to be able to talk about this feature that we're looking at here. So you had applied for the VA back loan? Do you remember how that process went? Can you kind of outline for us the steps that you went through to get that loan? A general,

**P4:** went online, found the form, pulled it out, submitted it with a copy of my dd 214. Okay. And it sent me the paper and my dd 214 back showing that I was eligible.

**M:** Alright, so you're talking about looking online, and you found out the form for the certificate of eligibility? Yes, sir. Is that? Okay? All right. I'm trying to remember offhand what the number that is. I think it's an 1880. So you just basically. Oh, no, that's fine. No worries at all. All these numbers run together. So you printed off the form, filled it out, and then sent it in? Is that the steps in your process?

**P4:** Yes, sir.

**M:** He's using the US mail.

**P4:** Okay. Yes, sir.

**M:** All right. Um, so as far as the rest of the loan process, can you describe for us how how that went?

**P4:** I found the property I wanted was told that I would be back to a certain amount. And so whenever I found the property, it was submitted to the government to how much the property was they agreed that that was a good price for it. They sent a gentleman out to inspect. And at first, she did not agree with the inspection.

**M:** Okay,

**P4:** state of Florida, you have to have air conditioning.

**M:** It's important.

**P4:** And the aircon, your chair didn't work. I had been hit by lightning. So they had to put a whole new system in. And then after that, it was approved and my lung went through and I got my property.

**M:** Okay, that sounds good in in big terms, just in, in general thinking about the process. So would you say that it went really well. Were there any problems that you ran into that you remember? From the time

**P4:** I bed in time we closed with less than two months?

**M:** That sounds like it went pretty well then. So you don't recall any big stumbling blocks or any any issues or problems that kind of derailed things?

**P4:** No chair because there was already a stove in the house. Because that's also something for the the loan agreement for the VA is that there has to be someplace to cook you do not have to have any place to keep your food cold. Because you can go to the store every day and by your feet have to have some way of cooking.

**M:** Okay, so that was a VA requirement from what you remember that the VA requirement.

**M:** Yeah, it seems like every house should kind of come with a place to cook food but I think that's the first I've heard that the VA requires it. So I appreciate that feedback. Do you remember anything that went particularly? Well, something that was surprising, like, Oh, that was easy.

**P4:** Getting much of eligibility.

**M:** Okay, so you found that to be actually pretty easy?

**P4:** Yes, sir. Good.

**M:** Okay. And then just in terms of any single big problem that you ran into, you mentioned that the inspector said, Hey, the AC has been hit by lightning. Okay. So that's, that's one thing that you've mentioned, Was there another problem with the lender, or the process that you can remember, that kind of stopped things.

**P4:** Um, when I was getting the property mice, I was with a gentleman that was a Vietnam veteran, we were not married. And because we were not married, or because we were not a couple of things act, right. We could not go on the loan together. I had better credit. So when in my name, and when we made the closing cost and payment and all of that stuff, I had to prove to them that he had went to his bank took out a certain amount of money and gave it me, you pay on closing costs. Gotcha. Because I had to be able to show exactly where every penny of my money went.

**M:** Okay, so it sounds like the the, just the big issue that you had to go through was justifying what you know, some of the money that you have for closing costs, and just the length these sound like lenders requirements to me. So you ran into a little bit of a problem with that. Is that right? So what

Unknown Speaker  6:39  
No, it was actually the VA, or the VA did require this,

**P4:** the VA required me to be able to show that I was going to be able to make my monthly payment, okay, and want to know how I got my my down payment and payment, I'm sorry, I had I didn't have put down payment, my closing costs and all the inspection fees and, and that stuff, they want to know where I got all that money from.

**M:** Okay, so the VA made that requirement. Yes. Asking about the I'm asking about the lender at this point. Did you work with a lender who was familiar with veterans and VA loans?

**M:** The lender? Yes.

**P4:** I guess it'd be like an outsourcing company. Lady. No, she really wasn't familiar with that. She studied up on on what needed to be done and everything. And within a week, she was a power.

**M:** Okay. So she wasn't familiar at first, but she went looked up everything. And then she was she pretty much had all the answers after spend a little time and she was good with it at that point.

**P4:** Yes, sir. Because it was a national company that I was going through for my loan. She did work for them. Okay.

**M:** So going back to the just this general home buying process, you mentioned that you went online and you searched found the form, you filled it out. Were there any other tools, whether they're online or any other forms of paperwork, anything else that was especially helpful, or anything that was easy made the process easy for you?

**P4:** Oh, follow following the instructions online, how to fill the form out and who to get it to.

**M:** Okay, so the form you're talking about here is that's the CSV again.

**P4:** Yes, sir. Okay, so

**M:** the online directions for the form itself, we're, we're easy.

**P4:** We're clear, sir.
