`WIP -- Review/feedback needed`

## Goals
Our first goal is to determine where a COE tool fits into the overall user journey, and what are the pain-points in the current process. We also want to assess user expectations regarding functionality, and decide what supporting content and features would improve the COE tool. Finally, we want to understand the general level of acceptance for a web-based self-service COE tool.

**The goals of this document are to:**

- Ensure the study is in alignment with the perceived findings of observers and notetakers
- Consolidate insight from team/stakeholder/designers as we analyze the data, so that we align on specific directions to pursue

## Participants and testing sessions

We scheduled 10 sessions beginning March 2; the last session was conducted March 5. Eight of the 10 participants attended.

## Guiding questions

- ZZZ

### Participants found the VA-backed loan process generally confusing
- ZZZ

### Process stumbling blocks arose around documentation issues, however COE was likely fairly straight-forward
- ZZZ

### Participants will want a simple, easy to follow, bulletized process flow with direct links (email, chat, phone numbers) to VA problem-solvers
- ZZZ

### Participants would use VA.gov if it provided easy to follow guidance and direct avenues to address process issues
- ZZZ

## Other notes
- Several participants noticed the View Payments link; three said they would reference payment history if/when making changes to their DD info
- All participants except one said they would like a chat function available for inquiries or confirmation; one user in particular, said they did not want to wait for call center hours if there was suspected fraud, and a chat box would provide an immediate response
- A generational split was evident in several cases: 
  - Two younger users joined the call using their phones, expecting to review the feature on mobile
  - Younger users would use a bank app/website to find their bank info, older users would review a check or statement to find the info
  - The two youngest participants expected a logged-in profile would have the DD feature; the older participants looked for dedicated links or pages
