`WIP -- Review/feedback needed`

## Goals
Our first goal is to determine where a COE tool fits into the overall user journey, and what are the pain-points in the current process. We also want to assess user expectations regarding functionality, and decide what supporting content and features would improve the COE tool. Finally, we want to understand the general level of acceptance for a web-based self-service COE tool.

**The goals of this document are to:**

- Ensure the study is in alignment with the perceived findings of observers and notetakers
- Consolidate insight from team/stakeholder/designers as we analyze the data, so that we align on specific directions to pursue

## Participants and testing sessions

We scheduled 10 sessions beginning March X; the last session was conducted March Y. Eight of the 10 participants attended.

#### Expectations
- Almost every participant said they expected further notification that their DD change was made
- Email and texts were cited as examples for expected confirmation
- Several users expected a long wait if they needed to call the 800 number with an inquiry
- Most users felt the DD change would take effect (or should take effect) immediately or soon
- A pair of participants believed there could be a processing delay of 30 days or a month

### How do users react to the two different "categories" of payments--and having to change them separately?
- Almost all participant accepted that there were two DD features; one explained that it was acceptable since there were two types of payments
- One user was notably irritated that there were two direct deposit "boxes" and wanted to know why there couldn't be just one
- Users who were directed to change their EDU payments used the correct feature; participants who were not directed to a particular payment type, went to C&P first
- Participants generally accepted, and even regarded favorably the "you don't receive this kind of payment" notice

### What other features do users expect on the DD screen?
- The top improvement cited by participants was a chat-box for inquiries and confirmation
- Another notable suggestion was to move the "fraud" notice into the boxes themselves; every user initially missed the note about bank fraud

## Hypotheses

### Users may have some difficulty locating their direct deposit information
This was true for a majority of users. A generational divide was evident here, with younger users expecting (and finding) a user profile section, and older users looking for a direct link or content page regarding DD.

### Users will rarely, some occasionally, change their direct deposit information
Generally true. Participants general remembered having to change DD info at some point, though the consensus was "not often." Only one participant actually remembered making a change, and this participant said they need to change their bank and DD info multiple times.

### Participants will accept and easily navigate the DD edit function
This was resoundingly true. No user had any issues making a change to the DD info--either singly or both. All participants were satisfied with the interface and ease of use. 

### Participants will have some questions/hesitation about two distinct Direct Deposit features
Not true. Only one participant expressed frustration with having to manage two sets of DD info. Several beleived it was reasonable that different payment type had different DD info (even if it was the same bank).

### Users may want more information about the DD change process
This was somewhat true. Generally users accepted what they saw on-screen. A few users liked having the View Payments link. However no participant saw the fraud box until prompted to scan/review the screen. Two participants said this note should be more prominent.

## Other notes
- Several participants noticed the View Payments link; three said they would reference payment history if/when making changes to their DD info
- All participants except one said they would like a chat function available for inquiries or confirmation; one user in particular, said they did not want to wait for call center hours if there was suspected fraud, and a chat box would provide an immediate response
- A generational split was evident in several cases: 
  - Two younger users joined the call using their phones, expecting to review the feature on mobile
  - Younger users would use a bank app/website to find their bank info, older users would review a check or statement to find the info
  - The two youngest participants expected a logged-in profile would have the DD feature; the older participants looked for dedicated links or pages
