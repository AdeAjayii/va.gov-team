`WIP -- Review/feedback needed`

## Goals
Our first goal is to determine where a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) tool fits into the overall user journey, and what are the pain-points in the current process. We also want to assess user expectations regarding functionality, and decide what supporting content and features would improve the COE tool. Finally, we want to understand the general level of acceptance for a web-based self-service COE tool.

**The goals of this document are to:**

- Ensure the study is in alignment with the perceived findings of observers and notetakers
- Consolidate insight from team/stakeholder/designers as we analyze the data, so that we align on specific directions to pursue

## Participants and testing sessions

We scheduled 10 sessions beginning March 2; the last session was conducted March 5. Eight of the 10 participants attended.

## Hypotheses

### Participants generally followed their lenders' leads through the loan process
**This was true in almost all cases.**

### Participants received COEs either via a VA office or through their lender
**Partially true.** Many particpants said they couldn't recall when/where the received their COE. Those who did, used eBenefits or completed a paper form.

### Participants found the VA-backed loan process generally confusing
**Not true.** Participants uniformly said the loan/home buying process went well, and their lender or realtor had the answers they needed.

### Process stumbling blocks might arise around documentation issues, however COE was likely fairly straight-forward
**Not true and true.** There were few stumbling block related to getting a COE; most participants who recalled applying for a COE felt it was an easy process.

### Participants will want a simple, easy to follow, bulletized process flow with direct links (email, chat, phone numbers) to VA problem-solvers
**Generally true.** Several participant did ask for a bulletized checklist for the loan/homebuying process; a couple said they did want direct lines to local VA offices.

## Other notes
- Several participants noticed the View Payments link; three said they would reference payment history if/when making changes to their DD info
- All participants except one said they would like a chat function available for inquiries or confirmation; one user in particular, said they did not want to wait for call center hours if there was suspected fraud, and a chat box would provide an immediate response
- A generational split was evident in several cases: 
  - Two younger users joined the call using their phones, expecting to review the feature on mobile
  - Younger users would use a bank app/website to find their bank info, older users would review a check or statement to find the info
  - The two youngest participants expected a logged-in profile would have the DD feature; the older participants looked for dedicated links or pages

## Key findings

1. Participants have a general awareness of VA home loan benefits
2. Participants were uniformly satisfied with their VA home loan process
3. Participants had varying experiences with obtaining a COE, though none were problematic
4. Many participants said they'd benefit from a VA home loan checklist to guide then through the process
5. Several participants suggested they'd benefit from a "VA-approved" list of lenders or realtors

## Details of findings

### 1. Participants have a general awareness of VA home loan benefits
All participants said they started the home-buying process with a general awareness of VA home loan bebefits. They generally cited word-of-mouth and the experiences of friends and family as their initial source. A couple of participants remember the subject of home loan benefits being covered during out-processing (i.e. TAP) presentations. A few participants remember searching eBenefits or VA.gov for information.

### 2. Participants were uniformly satisfied with their VA home loan process
It was very interesting (and heartening) that most all parcipants felt their VA loan experience was problem-free, many saying it was quick and easy. Those who mentioned a timeframe said it took just a month (or two) to from start to closing. Many metioned they relied on their lender or realtor to guide them through the steps. It's possible that since their experiences ended well (a new home), participants' recollections are shaded toward the positive. 

### 3. Participants had varying experiences with obtaining a COE, though none were problematic
Participant had varying (or no) recellections of their experience applying for a Certificate of Eligibility. A few did remember specifics: a couple went to eBenefits and got the automatic-COE, one searched for the form online then mailed-in the application. The remainder said it just seemd to be "part of the paperwork," or that teir lender must've taken care of getting the COE.

Most participants knew the COE was a pre-requisite for getting a VA-backed loan; some knew that it included the amount to which VA would back the loan. When asked about COE requirements, several items were consistently mentioned (though some may not be actual requirements):
- Military service
- Good credit history
- No other VA loans
- DD214, Social Security card

No participant felt there was an undue documentation burden for COE. Only one participant was familiar with "Funding Fee Status."

### 4. Many participants said they'd benefit from a VA home loan checklist to guide then through the process
Regarding any other information or tools they'd want, several participants metioned they's benefit from a checklist that included the steps in the home loan process, as well as all VA requirements and documentation. VA.gov does have most of this information available, but only the Interest rate reduction refinance loan has a step-by-step subway map of its process.

### 5. Several participants suggested they'd benefit from a "VA-approved" list of lenders or realtors
Most participants felt it was very important to work with lenders and/or realtors who were experienced with VA-backed loans. A couple of particpants mentioned they would laike a list or lookup of VA-approved lenders and realtors. One person mentioned a problem with predatory lenders looking to take advantage of verterans and service members.

## Additional insights
- Some users mentioned they like eBenefits for it personalized "dashboard" organization; those who used EBN to get their COE said it was very easy
- Many said VA.gov had good information, but it was often hard to find; they cited too much content and confusing, circular links that led to the same pages.
