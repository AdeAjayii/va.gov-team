`WIP -- Review/feedback needed`

## Goals
Our first goal is to determine where a COE tool fits into the overall user journey, and what are the pain-points in the current process. We also want to assess user expectations regarding functionality, and decide what supporting content and features would improve the COE tool. Finally, we want to understand the general level of acceptance for a web-based self-service COE tool.

**The goals of this document are to:**

- Ensure the study is in alignment with the perceived findings of observers and notetakers
- Consolidate insight from team/stakeholder/designers as we analyze the data, so that we align on specific directions to pursue

## Participants and testing sessions

We scheduled 10 sessions beginning March 2; the last session was conducted March 5. Eight of the 10 participants attended.

## Guiding questions

### How and when did participants find out about VA loan benefits?
- Many participants couldn't recall when/where they specifically heard about VA loan benefits
- Word-of-mouth was a popular response
- Several cited TAP and other outprocessing programs
- A few had friends and family members get VA-backed loans

### Where did participants look for information about VA-backed loans?
- Only a couple of participants remember doing specific research into VA loans
- Those who did, mentioned Google and VA.gov
- Most participants relied on their realtor or lender for info and guidance

### What processes did users experience when applying for a VA-backed loan?
- Almost all participants remember the loan process as going very well
- They generally outlined a typical (happy-path) loan process:
   - Decide to buy
   - Find a realtor
   - Get qualified
   - Find a home
   - Find a lender
   - Go through inspections
   - Close on home
- There were anecdotal VA requirements sprinkled-in, most who recalled these remember VA inspections

### How did users obtain a COEs?
- Several users specifically remember getting a COE: paper form and eBenefits were cited
- More typically, users didn't specifically recall how they received a COE; figuring it was among the forms and required paperwork
- Participants generally trusted their realtors and lenders to guide them through VA paperwork

### What went well in the COE/loan processes?
- Most participants felt like the COE was a transparent part of the process
- Few participant could recall significant problems with the overall home loan process, and we generally happy with how things went
- Several participants identified their lender or realtor as the most helpful/positive aspect in navigating the VA loan process

### What problems did participants encounter in applying for VA-backed loans?
- Few specific probelmes were cited
- A couple of participants recall issues around VA home inspections, these were resolved relativley quickly

### What new features, information or tools would be beneficial?
- A few participants would like a home loan checklist identifying the setps in the process, as well as the specific documents need for a VA-backed loan (COE would be one of these)
- One participant said a COE should be available to veterans at discharge (similar to the availability of DD-214)
- A fe participants wanted some sort of VA accreditation or "seal of approval" for lenders and/or realtors; they cited concerne about predatory lenders

### Would participants use VA.gov for information, tools or applications in the future?
- Most participants would use VA.gov for information about VA-backed loans
- The most common tool mentioned was a "checklist" outlineing the end-to-end home buying process
- Several wanted a list/lookup of VA-approved lenders

## Hypotheses

- ZZZ

### Participants expected their lenders to know about VA-backed loans

- ZZZ

### Participants received COEs either via a VA office or through their lender
- ZZZ

### Participants found the VA-backed loan process generally confusing
- ZZZ

### Process stumbling blocks arose around documentation issues, however COE was likely fairly straight-forward
- ZZZ

### Participants will want a simple, easy to follow, bulletized process flow with direct links (email, chat, phone numbers) to VA problem-solvers
- ZZZ

### Participants would use VA.gov if it provided easy to follow guidance and direct avenues to address process issues
- ZZZ

## Other notes
- Several participants noticed the View Payments link; three said they would reference payment history if/when making changes to their DD info
- All participants except one said they would like a chat function available for inquiries or confirmation; one user in particular, said they did not want to wait for call center hours if there was suspected fraud, and a chat box would provide an immediate response
- A generational split was evident in several cases: 
  - Two younger users joined the call using their phones, expecting to review the feature on mobile
  - Younger users would use a bank app/website to find their bank info, older users would review a check or statement to find the info
  - The two youngest participants expected a logged-in profile would have the DD feature; the older participants looked for dedicated links or pages
