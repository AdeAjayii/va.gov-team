## Warm-up
**M** We're good. Thank you. Okay, so we'll start out just, uh, if you would tell us a little bit about yourself, maybe starting with your service history.

**P3** I was in the military from July 2005. to July of 2009. combat. I served in Afghanistan. Now I am a military spouse. My husband is active duty. I'm I'm in school right now for my doctorate. Three children, ranging from three to 18. Yeah, that's, I think that's about it.

**M** Wow, that's enough. Uh, going with three kids. First of all three kids is enough. But going for your doctorate. That's a workload right there. Yes. Okay. So we're here to talk about the VA loan process. I've got another person I'm going to let in here we go. All right. So you have applied for a VA back loan or a VA direct loan in the past?

**P3** Yes.

## Section one: The loan process

- So when you applied for the loan, what were the steps in the process?
- What -- or who-- was the biggest help in getting you through the process?
- What went well in applying for the loan?

- What other problems did you run into?
- Thinking about the home-buying process in general, what tools do you remember being especially helpful or easy-to-use?

## Section two: COE
- Can you tell us what a Certificate of Eligibility is? Can you tell us how you got a COE?
- What were the most challenging things about getting your COE? What was easy; what difficulties were there?
- What do you know about COE requirements?
- I have a detail question about the COE: your Funding Fee status is an item on the COE, was this important for you to know when you applied for COE and why?
- What documentation did you have to provide? What challenges did this cause?
- What other options do you know of for how to get a COE?
- Knowing what you do now about COE, would you do anything differently?

## Section three: tools and features
- Thinking about your experience with VA websites, what experiences -- good and bad -- have you had in trying to manage your benefits?
- How do you feel about using VA websites for some or all of the VA loan process? What would you need to do that?
- What could we do -- on VA.gov or in the real world -- to make the getting a VA-back loan easier? 
- Looking back, what questions do you wish you had answered before you started?
- How could we make getting a COE simpler?
- What about the whole home-buying process? what do you wish it looked like?
- Thinking about the whole process, what advice would you give to someone applying for a VA-backed loan?
