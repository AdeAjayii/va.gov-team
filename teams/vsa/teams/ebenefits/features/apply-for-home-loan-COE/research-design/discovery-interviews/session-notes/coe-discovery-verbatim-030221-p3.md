## Warm-up
**M:** We're good. Thank you. Okay, so we'll start out just, uh, if you would tell us a little bit about yourself, maybe starting with your service history.

**P3:** I was in the military from July 2005. to July of 2009. combat. I served in Afghanistan. Now I am a military spouse. My husband is active duty. I'm I'm in school right now for my doctorate. Three children, ranging from three to 18. Yeah, that's, I think that's about it.

**M** Wow, that's enough. Uh, going with three kids. First of all three kids is enough. But going for your doctorate. That's a workload right there. Yes. Okay. So we're here to talk about the VA loan process. I've got another person I'm going to let in here we go. All right. So you have applied for a VA back loan or a VA direct loan in the past?

**P3:** Yes.

## Section one: The loan process
**M** Okay. Do you? Do you remember how you found out about VA loan benefits? Um,

**P3:** it was part of the out processing when I was in the military.

**M** Okay. Sounds good. So there was like there was tapper or something where they Yeah. Okay, sounds good. Do you remember when you apply for the loan? Um, what the steps were in the process, just kind of the big parts? How did it go? Well,

**P3:** the first thing was I had to find someone to finance the loan, then I had to do the CLE, the Sif, it's the certificate of eligibility. From there, it was pretty much smooth sailing. But when I printed out the original CEO, he they told me that, because it was computer generated the way it came out, um, that that wasn't good enough. So then I had to contact the VA through the 800 number, and get an original document. It was a man.

**M** Whoo. Okay, so it sounds like you had a problem and the problem centered on how the SEO was generated. Okay. So, with that in mind, how did you generate that Seo? We did you do it through a web site? Or was there some other way? No, I

**P3:** did it through a benefits. Okay. Gotcha.

**M** So that is the exactly the tool that we're talking about here. So we'll talk a little bit about that in just a minute then like to find out some details. So you say it was smooth sailing after you get the cod squared away?

**P3:** Yes.

**M** What was the biggest help? What? What made it go so well?

**P3:** I had used a roller coaster that my brother had previously used. So that was, yeah, that was, yeah, they already knew what I was looking for a friend in the business, and that made the process go a lot better. 

**M** Yeah. Okay. In the course of applying loan, you say that it was all smooth sailing, anything go particularly really well, any step of the process that you could say, well, you know, this was easy. No, I mean, yeah, yeah. Good. That is good. I can't say that everybody I know has had that experience. But we were two for two. Today, we've got two people that we've talked to that have had just, you know, smooth sailing all the way through. So you mentioned the CSV, are there any other issues that may have popped up in that process besides the UI? Or is that

**P3:** at the time I had to get do the tournament form for my disability rating to count for my income, but again, because it was generated through EA benefits and didn't have like the official stamp? Or wasn't the what they considered the official award letter, I had to go through the process again, contacted the 800 number, um, and they were just kind of like, Oh, well, we can send out a letter, but it won't be sealed to so that took, yeah, that was that was a holy fit.

**M** So that was another piece of documentation. 

**P3:** Yes, because the original award letter was dated more than a year, so I couldn't use it. Right.

**M** So you had to get a new one. Okay. Um, so in? Well, we'll probably touch on that a little bit, too, because I'm very interested about documentation and documentation requirements, but thinking about your home buying process in general. Were there any other tools that you used? Besides you mentioned, he benefits and then you had a friend of the business Were there any other things that you used online or in the real world that took you through the process?

**P3:** I attempted to use the what is it united Veterans Association situations that like had veterans, like they're getting, they're supposed to be geared towards veterans like the relative and helping you do this stuff. But I found out a lot of those places wanted money up front, or they get like huge commissions for working with me or whatever. So like, it's like the companies that just put veterans in their name to Lloris to them only to find out that they're not military friendly.

**M** Right. Okay. Is that like a website that you went to to find these?

**P3:** Yep. Um, I think it's like united veterans or something.
