## Warm-up
**M:** Thank you. Okay. Well, to start out, if you would, please just tell us a little bit about yourself, maybe starting with your services?

**P2:** Sure. I did. Eight years of active duty separated and I've been in the reserves now for three years. Okay. Just about three. All right.

**M:** Sounds good. Hold on one sec. I am doing a technical thing I'm going to There we go. Cancel. All right. I had a participant show up in the inside. Okay. Um, so have you applied for a VA back long before or Native American direct loan?

**P2:** I said just just recently.

## Section one: The loan process

**M:** Okay, so you've got some really recent hands on experience? Yeah. How would you? Do you remember how you learned about this benefit?

**P2:** Um, it was usually just word of mouth. Right? I know, when, and, you know, I was reminded about it during top class, as well.

**M:** Okay. And that that's, uh, on separation, they run you through that to give you an idea of what sort of benefits to expect. Right? Right. Okay. Have you ever visited either va.gov? Or maybe he benefits? Okay, well, let's use the sites for let's start out with va.gov would have used that site for

**P2:** I haven't used va.gov as much as like, directly logging into my u benefits. va.gov. More recently, I guess? Because it seems like a lot of stuff would just redirect there first. But mostly for disability claims. Okay.

**M:** You're definitely running into part of what we're working on. If you go to EAD benefits, a lot of times it will send you straight back to va.gov. So you have more experience with the benefits then? Yeah. Okay. And what do you do with that

**P2:** time? Just processing disability and. Okay, the claims process?

**M:** Sounds good. So you mentioned that you've very recently gone through the loan process, or heard about it mostly from word of mouth. So when you apply for the loan, and I'm not sure where you are in that process of you're all the way through what you're all the way through? Great. Yeah. Can you outline for us the steps in your process? Just kind of big picture how it went? You know,

**P2:** I don't think I had to do anything with the VA. I think the bank handled pretty much everything. Okay. I did print off my, like disability claim form. But that was kind of the only thing I had to do the bank work with, with the VA to verify me.

**M:** All right, yeah, that is how it goes for a lot of people to the lenders have a direct line, and they're able to navigate,

**P2:** fill out some paperwork, asking about the VA stuff, like, and I think some of that were VA specific forms that were in the package, if I recall. Okay. And I, you know, I think I'm guessing that's what went to the VA. So I suppose I probably filled out some VA forms during the process. Okay,

**M:** so basically, you, you went to the lender and mentioned that you were a veteran, and they said, Great, we've got a packet for you. And among them were paper forms. Is that how you? Yeah,

**P2:** I mean, the electronic versions of some paper forms. Yeah.

**M:** Okay. So no websites and involved with them.

**M:** So when you were going through this process, what do you what do you feel was like the biggest help, or the biggest bonus, you know, in getting you through successfully?

**P2:** Um, in terms of actually like completing? Yeah. And just getting through the process. It could be a person could be uniform or whatever, ability to use DocuSign. That was a tool that they employed, the bank employed, okay. They took the paper forms, but they use DocuSign to create the fill in for like, amounts, numbers, signatures and initials. And so I could I literally did it all from my phone.

**M:** Wow. So that was super convenient.

**P2:** Yeah, I didn't have to go through another website. They just took the existing stuff and added a DocuSign to it. Okay.

**M:** So would you say that that was one of the things that went, you know, the best in the course of getting this done? You know,

**P2:** yeah, it was very smoothly like they having them do everything I was able to bottom line sign my stuff. So I knew it, you know, the information had to be okay. And then they just had to follow a follow up and follow through. I know that if something didn't match, the VA would have to reach out somehow. So it gave me the peace of mind being able to control the information that went forward, and just having that Do everything, you know, they scheduled the, you know, the VA home appraisal for me, they took the forms and verified my eligibility, they made sure I was in good standing and I wasn't like delinquent to any debts or anything with the VA was really helpful.

**M:** Great. Well, sounds like you were in really good hands there.

**P2:** Yeah.

**M:** I was thinking about the process. It sounds like it went really well. Oh, what would you say was the biggest stumbling block that showed up in that process?

**P2:** He went really smooth. I didn't really? I didn't really have any I mean, um,

**M:** there doesn't have to be,

**P2:** it would be preferable. I mean, and then proven point might be like, if I could have, you know, provided them with a certificate of eligibility instead of, I mean, I know, like those exist, obviously. But if I could have instead of filling out those forms, with them, if I could have like, done something on my own, and given them something with a confirmation number, right, um, that might have given me a little peace of mind, because I had to fill out these forms, right? And then they're processing authority issues, I still have to, like, rely on them. And, you know, with me, I'm in the reserves, and you can't get paid your disability benefit and reserve benefit at the same time. Okay, so every year, you have to kind of, like settle that with the VA. And I had settled my stuff, a couple weeks prior to this happening. And, you know, in the back of my head, I'm like, Oh, I hope that like the process has caught up. I hope they showed me not as delinquent. You know, what I mean? I've done that on my own, I would have been able just like, Hey, I went to the VA, I'm good. And, you know, scan this barcode or check this confirmation, and you can verify it, like it would have just given me a little peace of mind. Right? And, I guess, assurance in the process,

**M:** right? Sounds good. So just to kind of reflect that back to you, it sounds like everything went really well. And that if there was something that maybe could be improved, if you had some sort of self service thing where you could go and just make sure that the documentation is done, and then come to the lender with the documentation in hand, you would save a step or you you'd save that little tiny peace of mind.

**P2:** Yeah, but like a very, like something as easy as like printing off something, you know what I mean? Yeah. Because I, the VA sometimes can take processes and make them convoluted or complicated. And the customer service mechanism isn't really that easy. Right? You know, sometimes you have to go to their generic website and fill out like a contact form and hope that it goes to the right place kind of thing. Okay, I say that with like, some cautious has a tation. You know,

**M:** right now, that's, that's okay. That's, and that's understandable. We do talk to a lot of veterans, and we do here, you know, a lot of, you know, how this this, these lines of contact, go for them?
