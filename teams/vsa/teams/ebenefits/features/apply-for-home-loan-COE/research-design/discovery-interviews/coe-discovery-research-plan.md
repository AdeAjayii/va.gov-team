# Certificate of eligibility (COE) discovery interviews research plan
**VSA eBenefits Team | February 2021**

`James Adams, designer`

#### Background
A VA-issued Certificate of Eligibility (COE) is needed by Veterans, service members and surviving spouses looking to get a VA-backed home loan or Native American Direct Loan (NADL). The requirements for obtaining VA loans are service-based, and a COE confirms for lenders that an applicant qualifies for this benefit. Specific requirements depend on service dates and details.

The Certificate of Eligibility feature (VA From 26-1880) is being migrated from eBenefitsto VA.gov in an effort to consolidate Veteran self-service tools -- and to susnset the eBenefits site. Core functionality of the exiting feature will be preserved; other features may be added in subsequent iterations.

### Goals
The goal of this study is to determine users expectations, regarding functionality and supporting content and features, for a web-based self-service COE tool.
<!--
#### Guiding questions
- Where on VA.gov do users expect to find direct deposit (DD) information? 
- How often do users expect to review and/or update their DD information?
- What barriers prevent users from easily submitting changes to their DD info?
- How do users react to the two different "categories" of payments--and having to change them separately? 
- What other features do users expect on the DD screen?

#### Hypotheses
- Users may have some difficulty locating their direct deposit information
- Users will rarely, some occasionally, change their direct deposit information
- Participants will accept and easily navigate the DD edit function
- Participants will have some questions/hesitation about **two** distinct Direct Deposit features
- Users may want more information about the DD change process

### Method
We will engage in moderated discovery interviews conducted remotely using Zoom. Calls will be run using Zoom, but audio only -- there will be no video component or screen-sharing. Participants will be recruited using Perigean. The sessions will be recorded, and observers and notetakers may be in attendance.

#### The process
- There will be a quick warm-up and introduction to the discovery interview process
- The participant will be guided through a series of open-ended questions
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up
