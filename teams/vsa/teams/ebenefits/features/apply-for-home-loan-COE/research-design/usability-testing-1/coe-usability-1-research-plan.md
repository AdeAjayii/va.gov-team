# Certificate of eligibility (COE) usability testing research plan
**VSA eBenefits Team | April 2021**

#### Background

Veterans and service members (and survuving spouses) need a VA-issued Certificate of Eligibility (COE) get a VA-backed home loan or Native American Direct Loan (NADL). The requirements for obtaining VA loans are service-based, and a COE confirms for lenders that an applicant qualifies for this benefit, and the amount to which the recipient is backed. Specific individual requirements depend on service dates and details.

The Certificate of Eligibility feature (VA From 26-1880) is being migrated from eBenefits to VA.gov in an effort to consolidate Veteran self-service tools -- and to sunset the eBenefits site. Core functionality of the exiting feature will be preserved; other features may be added in subsequent iterations.

### Goals

The goal of this usability study is to assess how easily participants locate and apply for a Certificate of Eligibility in a VA.gov-based tool/form. 

#### Guiding questions
- Where, starting on the VA.gov home page, do users expect to find Certificate of Eligibility (COE) information? 
- Where does confusing language prevent users from undersanding the form?
- What barriers prevent users from easily applying for a COE?
- Where (on VA.gov) do users expect to find their COE after it has been granted?
- What other features would help users when they apply for a COE?
<!--
#### Hypotheses
- Users may have some difficulty locating their direct deposit information
- Users will rarely, some occasionally, change their direct deposit information
- Participants will accept and easily navigate the DD edit function
- Participants will have some questions/hesitation about **two** distinct Direct Deposit features
- Users may want more information about the DD change process
-->
### Method
We'll engage in moderated usability testing conducted remotely using Zoom. Remote testing is currently the only viable option, but the method should yield acceptable observations on which to base findings. Participants will be recruited using Perigean. These users will be asked to explore VA.gov (home), then will be provided links to a prototype of the COE feature (VA From 26-1880). The prototype is likely to include some facsimile of the landing page. The sessions will be recorded, and observers and notetakers may be in attendance.
<!--
#### The process
- There will be a quick warm-up and introduction to usability testing
- The user will be aked to navigate to VA.gov 
- The moderator will outline a scenario (use case) for the participant to follow
- The participant will aske to locate the DD feature
- After a brief period exploring a pth to DD, the users will be provided a link to the DD prototype
- The user will potentially proceed through review and editing of direct deposit info
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up
