This topline summary is a high level, top of mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

### The goals of this document are to:

- Make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
- Gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
- Jump start synthesis by quickly organizing high level themes

## Participants and testing sessions

We scheduled 12 sessions beginning Monday, June 14; the last session was conducted Monday, June 21. Five of the 12 participants attended.

## Initial findings (based on guiding questions)

### Participants primarily looked to white quads, specifically “Get your VA medical records” to find COE tool.
- One user utilized search, one used mega menu
- Only 2 users found the COE landing page

### Users see and complete sign in before seeing other useful information
- All 5 users signed in before seeing the map or reading the Auto COE blurb
- 1 of 5 users scrolled down to the bottom of the page, but only noted the estimated time to complete as useful after prompting

### All users understood what was happening, even if they didn’t understand where they were. 
- 1 of 5 participants understood the auto COE screen to be a different page
- 4 of 5 found the download link
- 3 users said they would print their COE and 2 said they would also save it and email it to their lender

### It was not clear to all users that they needed to apply to make changes.
- 4 of 5 users found the “make changes” link
- 3 of those 4 realized they’d linked back to the form
- 1 of those 4 noticed the make changes messaging, but didn’t understand that they needed to apply to make the change
- There are good quotes from the first and last (?) users that show the range of understanding here.

### Loan intent and document uploads were the two panels that slowed users down.
 - 4 of 4 users that saw the loan intent step were made the correct selection, but all paused and had to talk through the options
 - 1 of 5 wanted additional information on the loan intent options
 - 4 of 5 participants completed the upload without prompting
 - 3 of 5 noticed the language of which documents needed to be uploaded
 - 1 of 5 participants missed the "What kind of document are you uploading?" dropdown and could not continue
