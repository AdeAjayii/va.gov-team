This topline summary is a high-level, top-of-mind summary of trends found in the sessions, but it's not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

### The goals of this document are to:

- Make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
- Gain insight from team/stakeholders/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data
- Jump-start synthesis by quickly organizing high-level themes

## Participants and testing sessions

We scheduled 12 sessions beginning Monday, June 14; the last session was conducted Monday, June 21. Five of the 12 participants attended.

## Initial findings

### Participants primarily looked to white quads, specifically to the “Records” box, to find the COE tool.
- Users seems to gravitate toward the "Download your benefit letters" link
- One user utilized search, one used mega menu
- Two users found the COE landing page
- Two (?) participants saw COE links at the bottom of the letters screen
- It seems participants mentally connected a COE--which is a benefit document--with other benefits documents and expected they would be together on VA.gov

### On the COE intro screen, the sign-in widget generally distracted users from reviewing intro screen content.
- All five users signed-in before seeing the subway map or reading the auto COE blurb
- One user did scroll to the bottom of the page, but only noted the estimated time to complete as useful after prompting

### Participants generally accepted the auto COE screen's presentation and functionality
- All users understood what they 'received/found" their COE, even if they didn’t understand where they were redirected from the intro (P11 skipped the auto COE flow)
- One user seemed to understand the auto COE screen to be a different page
- All users on the auto COE screen found the COE download link and the COE PDF (P11 skipped the auto COE flow)
- Three users said they would print their COE, and two said they would also save it to email to their lender

### It was not clear to all users that they needed to "apply" to make changes.
- When asked to "make changes," all users did enter the form using the "apply" action link, though most felt the labeling was wrong 
- 3 of those 4 realized they’d linked back to the form
- 1 of those 4 noticed the make changes messaging, but didn’t understand that they needed to apply to make the change
- There are good quotes from the first and last (?) users that show the range of understanding here.

### Loan intent and document uploads were the two panels that slowed users down.
 - 4 of 4 users that saw the loan intent step were made the correct selection, but all paused and had to talk through the options
 - 1 of 5 wanted additional information on the loan intent options
 - 4 of 5 participants completed the upload without prompting
 - 3 of 5 noticed the language of which documents needed to be uploaded
 - 1 of 5 participants missed the "What kind of document are you uploading?" dropdown and could not continue
