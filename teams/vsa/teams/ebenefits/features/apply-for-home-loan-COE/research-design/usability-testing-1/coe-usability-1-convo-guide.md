## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I'm Jim, and with me are a few colleagues who are helping-out by observing and taking notes. We're part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that is moving some features of the old eBenefits site over to VA.gov. We're learning what veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful for you. Our focus today is the Certificate of Eligibility for VA-backed home loans.

There are a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 30 minutes. But you can end it at any time--just let me know. We have quite a few things to cover, so I may break-in occasionally and move us to the next item.
- We're not testing **you** in any way--so there are no right or wrong answers. We need to hear your thoughts and ideas about what we show you so that we can make improvements to the tool we're working on.
- So please say what's on your mind--good and bad. I won't be offended by any opinions you express.
- Today we'll be working with a prototype. It's not the "real thing," but most things we're testing will work. We'll have you walk through the tool and enter information, but because we're using prototypes, none of your actions will affect your account or any VA data.
- We'd like to record this session. This'll give us a reference for note-taking. We'll store the recording on a private drive, and we'll delete it when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.
- (Start recording) OK now, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up
- Please tell us a little bit about yourself? Maybe start with your service experience...
- Have you applied for a VA-backed loan before?
- (If "yes") How did that go, what was your experience?
- (if "no") What do you know about VA home loan benefits?
- What do you know about a VA Certificate of Eligibility?
- What VA sites have you used in the past? What did you do there?

OK, we'll be doing a couple of things today: 
- First, well take a quick look at the VA.gov home page to get an idea of where you might look for the new feature
- Then we'll go to the prototype of the new feature we're testing

## Wayfinding
### User screenshares / 5 minutes
- **Please go to VA.gov.**
- **Now we're ready to start.** OK, now could you share your screen with us?
- Here's a scenario: you're looking to buy a new home and a lender told you you'd need a Certificate of Eligibility (COE) from VA.
- You heard there was a way on VA.gov to apply for a COE, where would you look for that?
- This is the actual home page; you're free to click on anything.

#### Things to look for:
- What is the user's thought process?
- What interactive elements does the user look for (e.g. menu, links, footer...)?
- What content/section does the user expect to find COE information and the form itself?
- Where does the user's search end? Do they make it to the COE landing page?

## Usability tasks
User is directed to the prototype.
- I have a link in chat to the prototype we're testing; **please click on it.** (Clicks on prototype link to COE prototype)
- We'll be using made-up scenarios that may not really apply to you. We'll be filling-out a small form, and you can type-in anything--fake names and numbers are fine. 
- Nothing will be submitted because this is a prototype.
- For the purpose of this test, we'll continue with what we said earlier: you're looking to buy a new home and your lender said you needed a Certificate of Eligibility.
- So you've come to this page; what do you do next?
<!--
### Task 1 / View direct deposit info / 5 minutes
User reviews direct deposit information available for one or both payment types.
- Take a look at this screen and describe what you see.
- Now **find the direct deposit information for educational payments.** What info do you see?
- Describe what else is on this screen? ...What other payments types do you see?
- Why do you think there are two sets of payment info?
- If you thought you were the victim of bank fraud, what can you do?

#### Things to look for:
- How quickly does the user find the DD info?
- How do users react to **two** types of DD info on the screen? Why do they thing there are two?
- Can users quickly locate the "fraud" box at the bottom of the screen?

### Task 2 / Change direct deposit info / 10 minutes
User changes the direct deposit info to a "new" savings account.
- Let's say you moved and you had a new savings account. **Update the information for your educational payments.**
- How often have you updated your info? 
- If this were real information, what would expect to happen after you updated? 
- How long do you think that would take?

#### Things to look for:
- Do users immediately use the correct edit function (education)?
- Do users find the inline editing easy-to-use?
- Do users understand the tell-me-more accordion? Is the info regarding account and routing numbers clear and understandable?
- Are users satisfied with the success messaging?

### Task 3 / One payment type only / 5 minutes
User advances to a screen showing only compensation and pension direct deposit info.
- Take a look at this screen and describe what you see.
- Now **find the direct deposit information for educational payments.** What info is there?
- If you thought you should also be receiving comp & Pen payments, what can you do?
- Let's say you know this is right, and you don't get educational payments. How do you feel about the C&P box?

#### Things to look for:
- How do users react to the "You don't receive payments" messaging?
- What alternatives (if any) would users expect when they don't receive one or the other type of payment?
- Would users gravitate toward the View Payment History link at all?

## Final thoughts
- Where could you find a record of payments made to you? What other features might be helpful on this screen?
- What on the site would you do/look at next?
- How could we make things more clear?

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the screens we looked at, or VA.gov in general?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
