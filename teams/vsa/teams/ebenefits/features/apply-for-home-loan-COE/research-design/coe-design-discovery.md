## Problem
A VA-issued Certificate of Eligibility (COE) is needed by Veterans, service members and surviving spouses looking to get a VA-backed home loan or Native American Direct Loan (NADL). There are service-based requirements for obtaining VA loans, and a COE confirms for lenders that an applicant qualifies for the benefit: 

- 181 days of service during peacetime
- 90 days of service during war time
- 6 years of service in the Reserves or National Guard
- Some surviving spouses of service members who have died in the line of duty are also eligible

Home loan applicants must apply for a COE to ensure they meet eligibility requirements.

### Business cases

### Business processes

Users can apply for a COE by submitting VA Form 26-1880 by mail. Online, users can log into eBenefits and electronically submit the form. Many eBenefits users will have a COE automatically generated for download. Some lenders can generate a COE via VA's Web LGY system. 

#### VA Form 26-1880

The "paper" form is available [online](https://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/forms/vba-26-1880-are.pdf) as a fillable PDF. The form is a single page with an additional two pages of instructions and addresses. The form encourages users to apply electronically using eBenefits. The form has four sections:

- Section 1 -- Applicant information
- Section 1 -- Applicant's military service
- Section 3 -- Previous VA loans
- Section 4 -- Certification and signature
