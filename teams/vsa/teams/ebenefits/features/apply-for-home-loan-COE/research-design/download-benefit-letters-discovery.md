### Background

Usability testing of the new Certificate of Eligibility feature/design included wayfinding . Most participants expected to find their COE for VA-backed home loans in the "Download VA benefit letters" feature. The documentation quadrant on the VA.gov home page has a direct link to that tool. The benefits letters feature is not in active development.

The feature currently has a series of accordions that contain download link for various VA-issued documents. There is a link to the COE feature on eBenefits below these accordions.

There may need to be a "Download your COE" accordion and link in-line with the other download-accordions.
