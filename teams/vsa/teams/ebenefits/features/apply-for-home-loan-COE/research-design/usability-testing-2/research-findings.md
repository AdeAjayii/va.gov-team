# Research Goals
Veterans and service members (and surviving spouses) need a VA-issued Certificate of Eligibility (COE) get a VA-backed home loan or Native American Direct Loan (NADL). The requirements for obtaining VA loans are service-based, and a COE confirms for lenders that an applicant qualifies for this benefit, and the amount to which the recipient is backed. Specific individual requirements depend on service dates and details.

There are several ways a Veteran or service member can apply for and receive a COE. The online Certificate of Eligibility feature (VA From 26-1880) is being migrated from eBenefits to VA.gov in an effort to consolidate Veteran self-service tools -- and to sunset the eBenefits site.

The first usability study examining core functionality was tested in July 2021. Since that time, a new view tool has been added.

The goals of this usability study were to:
1. Assess the usability of the Request a Certificate of Eligibility form
2. Explore users' understanding of the View Your COE tool and statuses they could encounter

# Research Questions
- Can users successfully complete the form to request a COE?
- Can users successfully update their information in the request form?
- Do users understand how and when to follow up on their COE request?
- Can users successfully download their COE PDF?
- Can users successfully upload required documentation?
- Where do users expect to find the View Your COE tool?
- Where do users expect to find their COE if they already have one?
- Do users understand the status they might encounter?
- What other features or content would help users when they apply for a COE?
 
# Methodology 
We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on March 11 - 18, 2022. Participants were asked to complete a short way finding task on va.gov, and then were asked to complete three tasks in a [UXPin prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/65c0623a799c268173fe1a3cb4375f9ce00ad820#/pages/137557312/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhdmf):
1. Request a COE
2. Check their COE request status and upload a document
3. Download their COE

# Hypotheses and Conclusions
- Users will initially look for a direct link in the white quadrant on the home page; many will locate COE landing page after several steps
    - Likely True 
- The form itself will be relatively easy for users to navigate
    - Likely True
- Biographical, contact and service language will be clear to most users; the language around loan options and COE intent will be somewhat confusing
    - Definitely True
- Users will be able to download their COE if their status is Available or Auto, but may not recognize that there is additional action needed if their status is Pending with letters or uploads requested.
    - Likely False
- Users will expect their COE to be available in various ways: physical letter, email, printed, and/or within an authenticated profile/dashboard
    - Likely True
- Users will ask for directly available information (chat, direct phone, lookups) about the COE, lenders and /or realtors
    - Maybe True


# Key Findings

1. “Find out about your VA home loan COE” was not the language users were looking for, instead they used the side bar nav “Request a COE now”

2. The options on “Your service history” caused confusion for some users

3. The users that saw the “How will you use your Certificate of Eligibility?” screen had some confusion around what the options meant, particularly if they might fit into multiple categories.

4. The “(*Required)” label on the document uploader led users to believe they could not continue without uploading more documents. This is the one area where users stopped to call for help.

5. Users understood when and how to follow up.

6. When status is “Pending with documents needed”, users were able to discern that they needed to upload documents and that the list should have been mailed to them. They also found the list of letters on the page and used them to resolve status.

7. Users were able to find the “Download your COE” link quickly

8. Users expected to be able to return to the tool to download their COE again.
