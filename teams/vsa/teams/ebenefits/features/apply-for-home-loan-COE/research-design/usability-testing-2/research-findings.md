# Research Goals
Veterans and service members (and surviving spouses) need a VA-issued Certificate of Eligibility (COE) get a VA-backed home loan or Native American Direct Loan (NADL). The requirements for obtaining VA loans are service-based, and a COE confirms for lenders that an applicant qualifies for this benefit, and the amount to which the recipient is backed. Specific individual requirements depend on service dates and details.

There are several ways a Veteran or service member can apply for and receive a COE. The online Certificate of Eligibility feature (VA From 26-1880) is being migrated from eBenefits to VA.gov in an effort to consolidate Veteran self-service tools -- and to sunset the eBenefits site.

The first usability study examining core functionality was tested in July 2021. Since that time, a new view tool has been added.

The goals of this usability study were to:
1. Assess the usability of the Request a Certificate of Eligibility form
2. Explore users' understanding of the View Your COE tool and statuses they could encounter

# Research Questions
- Can users successfully complete the form to request a COE?
- Can users successfully update their information in the request form?
- Do users understand how and when to follow up on their COE request?
- Can users successfully download their COE PDF?
- Can users successfully upload required documentation?
- Where do users expect to find the View Your COE tool?
- Where do users expect to find their COE if they already have one?
- Do users understand the status they might encounter?
- What other features or content would help users when they apply for a COE?
 
# Methodology 
We conducted hour-long remote moderated research sessions via Zoom on March 11 - 18, 2022. Participants were asked to complete a short way finding task on va.gov, and then were asked to complete three tasks in a [UXPin prototype](https://preview.uxpin.com/65c0623a799c268173fe1a3cb4375f9ce00ad820#/pages/137557312/simulate/no-panels?mode=cvhdmf):
1. Request a COE
2. Check their COE request status and upload a document
3. Download their COE

# Hypotheses and Conclusions
- Users will initially look for a direct link in the white quadrant on the home page; many will locate COE landing page after several steps
    - Likely True 
- The form itself will be relatively easy for users to navigate
    - Likely True
- Biographical, contact and service language will be clear to most users; the language around loan options and COE intent will be somewhat confusing
    - Definitely True
- Users will be able to download their COE if their status is Available or Auto, but may not recognize that there is additional action needed if their status is Pending with letters or uploads requested.
    - Likely False
- Users will expect their COE to be available in various ways: physical letter, email, printed, and/or within an authenticated profile/dashboard
    - Likely True
- Users will ask for directly available information (chat, direct phone, lookups) about the COE, lenders and /or realtors
    - Maybe True


# Key Findings
`WIP: Draft Findings`

1. “Find out about your VA home loan COE” was not the language users were looking for, instead they used the side bar nav “Request a COE now”.

2. The options on “Your service history” caused confusion for some users.

3. The users that saw the “How will you use your Certificate of Eligibility?” screen had some confusion around what the options meant, particularly if they might fit into multiple categories.

4. The `(*Required)` label on the document uploader led users to believe they could not continue without uploading more documents. This is the one area where users stopped to call for help.

5. Users understood when and how to follow up.

6. When status is “Pending with documents needed”, users were able to discern that they needed to upload documents and that the list should have been mailed to them. They also found the list of letters on the page and used them to resolve status.

7. Some users expected a confirmaiton page after uploading documents on "Pending" task. 

8. Users were able to find the “Download your COE” link quickly.


# Details of Findings 

**Finding 1**

Labels: DSC: Action link, DSP: Content presentation 

"Find out about your VA home loan COE” was not the language users were looking for, instead they used the side bar nav “Request a COE now”

> 4 of 6 users did not associate the text of the action link "Find out about your VA home loan COE" with requesting a COE and instead used the "Request a COE now" sidebar nav link

> "What am I looking for? What do you say I am looking for? I would push Request a COE now on the left-hand side."


**Finding 2**

Labels: DSP: Content presentation 

The options on “Your service history” caused confusion for some users.

> 2 of 6 users stopped to talk through issues with service history quesitons

> One user had 2 service history periods separated by a 2 month period and wasn't sure how to enter them.
> One user had trouble sorting out options that mixed Veteran and active status in one selection

**Finding 3**

Labels: DSP: Content presentation 

The users that saw the “How will you use your Certificate of Eligibility?” screen had some confusion around what the options meant, particularly if they might fit into multiple categories.

> 2 of the 3 participants who saw the loan intent option selection stopped to talk through selections and were not sure if they had selected the correct choice for their situation

> 1 of the participants is a realtor who works with many veteran families. They said they frequently get questions from their clients about these selection choices.

> "I am not sure what they mean about restoration of entitlement means. I thought to hover over it, but nope. The cash out is pulling equity out of the home, then I know the IRRL. The one I selected is for someone trying to get the COE, maybe the top is for someone that sold the home and now entitled to another one.... I guess now that I think about it I would select this one. Maybe a hyperlink right there for an explanation. Maybe I am ignorant that I don’t know."

**Finding 4**

Labels: DSC: Form controls

The `(*Required)` label on the document uploader led users to believe they could not continue without uploading more documents. This is the one area where users stopped to call for help.

> 4 of 6 users did not understand that they could continue after uploading the first document during the initial form.
> 2 of 6 users said they would stop and call for help.
> 2 of 6 users did not understand that they were finished after uploading a document in the "Pending with uploads required" task
> "They need more information. I would be confused here."
> "My first thought here is that why is it not already on file but I know they said I needed it. Will it let me go forward if I don’t add it. I would expect it not to let me go forward without adding it. That’s weird it gives all of these choices when it just wants your DD214. I could see the proof of honorable service or statement of service or annual retirement points. I don’t know why hub 1 or some of the other ones would be there because a regular person wont know what it is. It is weird they let them choose that when all it wants is proof of service."

**Finding 5**

Labels: DSP: Content presentation

Users understood when and how to follow up.

> All 6 users noted that 5 days was the expected follow up time and expected to receive an email. They would return to va.gov to check the status.
> "I would print it [the confirmation] off or save as a PDF. I would print a screenshot of the contact information. I would wait the 5 business days if not I would call them." How would you expect for them to get in contact with you? "Up here it says email."

**Finding 6**

Labels: 

When status is “Pending with documents needed”, users were able to discern that they needed to upload documents and that the list should have been mailed to them. They also found the list of letters on the page and used them to resolve status.

> All 6 users immediately noted that they needed to provide additional information.
> 5 of 6 users found the letters without assistance and successfully uploaded the requested document.
> 3 of 6 users wanted the needed documents listed directly on the page.

**Finding 7**

Labels: 

Some users expected a confirmaiton page after uploading documents on "Pending" task.

> ... 

**Finding 8**

Labels:  

Users were able to find the “Download your COE” link quickly.

> ...

# Additional Insights

- Users expected to be able to return to the tool to download their COE again.
- Despite some issues, users were positive about the experience.
- One participant noted that the timing given on the landing page was "minutes" for an automatic COE, but the confirmation page stated 5 days.
   > Okay, back to the beginning of this and the automatic COE. I cant remember if it was on the actual va page but it said I would get it back within minutes but now this says within 5 days. I would think it would be sooner, I would have liked to know if it would be 5 business days beforehand.
- 2 participant noted that the instructions say to work with your lender, so they were unsure why they would want or need to fill out the form online.
- 1 participant asked if the emails would come to their personal email or their "secure messaging" (where they receive healthcare messages).
