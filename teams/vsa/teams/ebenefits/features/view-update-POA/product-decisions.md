- Is there regular downtime on partner systems for things like scheduled maintenance?
- Is the Office of General Counsel responsible for managing the system/process?
3. What is the appointment process?
- Where or who set the rep in CorpDB for the Veteran
4. How long does that take?
5. How often is the list of accreddited reps updated?
- It seems that email address is preferred for initial contact (reaching out directly), is that collected and available? Or will it eventually? Is it a spam risk?
6. Is there a place to determine if the application is pending?
- Do we need to manage its status?
7. How does SEP play a role?
