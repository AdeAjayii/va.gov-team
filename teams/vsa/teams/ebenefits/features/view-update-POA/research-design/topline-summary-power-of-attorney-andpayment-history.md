This topline summary is a result of the synthesis that happens after conducting/observing research sessions. This is a high level summary of trends and analysis, but is not the final result of working with the data discovered. The information in this document may change following a deeper review and analysis of the data gathered.

**The goal of this document is:**
 - To make sure everyone who observed the study is in alignment with the perceived findings
 - To gain insight from team/stakeholder/designers and determine specific directions to pursue as we analyze the data

## Research Questions & Answers
### Power of Attorney
**Is the wizard intuitive to the Veterans?**</br>
 - Participants remarked that the steps were “Easy to complete or fairly straight forward”
 - Participants favored the small amount of information and limited interaction per screen.
- There were certain steps where participants did not understand reducing the intuitiveness of the step specifically, the VA number, limiting , privacy act, and the insurance number. Also, several participants who had errors filling out the form stated this page lacked contextual understanding of what the error is and how to rectify the error.
 
**Is the information presented clearly?** </br>
- Participants did not understand they were filling out form 21-22. Because participants did not understand they were filling out form 21-22, the participants were unsure of how to fill out certain steps. 
- Two things hindered participants from completing steps: when the step instructions were in legal language or if there was a lack of content, which reduced context.
- Participants indicated a preference towards summarizing legal language into layman terms.

**Do Veterans understand what the different Power of Attorney steps mean?
**</br>
-----
**Do users understand how to fill in each field?** </br>
- Participants did express lacking confidence in how they completed certain steps making remarks “is this the correct information to provide” and “I don’t know? Should I answer it this way.” 
- Other steps were confidently answered seen by statements like “Yes, it clear ask for this.”
- Participants were hesitant to complete certain fields and expressed their desire to “get more information or talk to someone about this”.  
- Participants had mistrust for the VA and worried that if their form was incorrectly filed out if would negatively affect the outcome of the appeal 
- Participant who expressed confidence in their answers coincided with comments about the steps clear and easy to complete.

**What do users think will happen after they’ve submitted the form?** </br>
- Participants were unclear about what would happen once they completed the form.
- Participants often remarked ask questions about will the VA send this form to the chosen representative?  

**What information do Veterans expect to see in the search results?** </br>
- Participants favored representatives with complete information over incomplete information, like missing a number or address. 
- Participants in more populated with more representatives in the table often stated distance as search criteria. 
- Participants with less results wished to have nonlocal representation offered.  
- Several participants favored a section displacing the representative’s subspecialties, prevailing numbers, and representatives name.  

**How do users navigate the representative results?**</br>
-	
**What other tools/sites do vets use to complete the Power Of Attorney Form?** </br>

- Participants spoke about word-of-mouth and Veteran services as valued resources.

**How do veterans determine to employ a representative to dispute their claims?** </br>

- Examples of criteria are trust, distance, and accessibility to representative.

## Hypotheses & Answers
### Power of Attorney
**Veteran will easily navigate through the wizard and efficiently locate, find, and select their representative, but the following issues may arise:
- Clearly understanding the component's shift from a wizard to a search feature back to a wizard.
- Realizing whether or not the veteran understands their rights have been legally “handed over.”

### Payment History
Our hypothesis is, the veteran will have two principal ways they will use the tool.  First, expected features should be centered around efficiently searching for a particular payment or a period of payments. Secondly, the veteran will also like to view only the last several (5-10) payments/returns.

## Other Findings
**Participants most commonly used the Facility Locator when traveling or moving to an unfamiliar area**
- All participants mentioned having previously used the tool when they were away from their "home" VA locations
> “The first VA facility I went to in Boston was not a hospital, and I was trying to get to a hospital so there was some confusion there... Most recently, having learned from that experience, I used the locator to find my VA hospital for Manhattan where I went for my intake appt.”

**People are more likely to utilize the Facility Locator to research locations**
- Participants want to use the tool to scope out the offerings in an unfamiliar area
- Participants did not use the Facility Locator for task-based prompts
- Most participants mentioned that they only used the tool once: either when moving to a new location or traveling to an unfamiliar area
> “I was looking to see which facilities have community living centers connected to hospitals.” 

> "When I first moved up here to [my city] I was trying to see where I could go."

**Expected results for map depends on geographic location**
- Rural participants mentioned that they wanted to only see the top 3-4 locations near them as anything outside of that would be too far to travel
- Urban participants expected to see a smaller radius on the map but with far more location pins to compare
> “I'm surprised when I did this one that its focused on Manhattan and it's showing me Manhattan... ” (urban)

> "I'd rather it was more narrowed in... Because when I type in my address, I don't care about something way out in [redacted], I'm not going that far. Or in [redacted]. Generally I care about 1,2,3,4. The 4 closest to me."

**Distance and travel time vary by location**
> "It's not so much a matter of distance as much as being easy to get there. Honestly, if it's accessible via public transit in a reasonable time Frame, 45 min-ish or a cheap, cost effective cab ride." (urban)

> "See? that's what's great - I can go under 2 miles to find urgent care in NYC. To me this is amazing... When I'm in florida everything is so far away but I can drive a lot faster." (urban/rural)

> "As it is I have to drive 55 miles from here to [redacted] for my primary care. Now they have a clinic in [redacted] which is only 15 miles away, but they don't have everything that VA has." (rural)

**Users interpret facility descriptions differently**
> "I'd be confused by VA health and VA benefits."

> "VA health, I would consider like primary care doctors at a va facility. Community providers, that would be satellite offices."

> "I guess I'd have to go to emergency care, because that's where a hospital would be?"
