## Intro
Good morning/afternoon and thank you for joining us today. My name is Candy and I have a few colleagues on the line to help me take notes. We are part of a team with the Department of Veterans Affairs that's moving some features of the old eBenefits site over to VA.gov. We're learning what Veterans need to improve their online experience, and how we can make VA.gov more useful for them. Our focus today is how users find and appoint representatives.

There are a few things I need to mention before we start:
- The session should take about 30 minutes. But you can end it at any point -- just let me know. We have quite a few things to cover, so to respect your time, I may occasionally break-in to move us to the next item.
- We're not testing you in any way -- there are no right or wrong answers. We want to hear your thoughts about your experiences so that we can make improvements to VA.gov.
- Please say what's on your mind -- good and bad. I will not be offended by any opinions you express.
- We'd like to record this session. This'll give us a record to use for note-taking. We'll store the recording on a private drive, and it will be deleted when we conclude our testing and note-taking. No personal identifying information will be transcribed.
- I'll ask "on the record" once the recording starts.
- OK, now that I've hit the button, do I have your permission to record this session?

## Warm-up
- Would you tell us a little bit about yourself? How long have you been a representative, general experiences with the VA?
- How did you get into representing veterans?

## Section one: Becoming a VSO/rep
- How is your role commonly referred to? VSO, Veteran Service Officer, rep, etc.?
- What are your own service and VA benefits experiences?
- What credentials or training are need to be a VSO?

## Section two: Starting an appointment
Okay, let’s talk a little bit about how Veterans and Service Members find you and start an appointment.
- Do they typically come through the VA lookup, some other search like Google, referrals…?
- Do Veterans or Service Members select a rep individually or are they assigned in some way? If assigned, how does that happen or who makes that choice?
- Do they typically reach out for a consultation before submitting an appointment? If yes, is that usually by phone, email, webform…?
- How far along in the benefits/claims process are Veterans when they reach out? 
- When Veterans are ready to make an appointment do they typically use VA 21-22/a? If so, do they typically use a paper form or submit electronically?
 
## Section three: Working with Veterans
Thank you, that really helps me understand how Veterans start this process. Now, let’s talk about how things work after they have appointed you as their representative. 
- How much information do you typically have when you receive an appointment?
- After a Veteran or Service Member appoints you as their representative, how often do you interact with them?
- How do you usually work with them - phone, email, in person, etc?
- What are the most common issues you help with?
- Do you have a specialty that you focus on or do you handle all claims? Is that typical for representatives?

## Section four: Limits and ending appointment
Okay, we’re almost finished. I’d just like to ask a few more questions about the limits of representation and how representation ends.
- What are the limits on what you can help with? When would you need to decline an appointment or refer to another representative?
- When do you usually find out that a case has an issue like that - is it early in the process or later after quite a bit of work has been done?
- How long do appointments last?
- When do appointments end - at the end of a claims process, after a certain amount of time…?
- If you could change just one thing about the process of being appointed as a representative for a Veteran, what would it be?

## Wrap-up
Looks like we covered everything on my list. (ALT) Looks like we're at (time), so we'll need to leave it here. Is there anything else you'd like us to know--something we didn't cover about the representative process, claims process, or VA.gov in general?

## Closing
Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us! Your feedback is critical to our team's effort to improve Veterans' online experiences--and VA.gov in particular. Enjoy the rest of your day!
