## Warm-up
- VSO programs manager at office works out of Silve Springs MD; works out of Washington DC
- Been with VBA(?) for over a year; job is to be intermediary to provide info to people in the field
- Started just looking for a job; saw position with VSO claims and appeals
- Really enjoys advocating for Veterans; helping Veterans really matters
- Served eight years in USMC; two tours in Iraq; out of reserves, now retired

## Section one: Becoming a VSO/rep
- Prefers the term "VSO" to "rep" (representative)
- Mandatory training, TRIPS training and HIPAA like other VA employees
- There is a lengthy VSO training regarding claims/appeals processes
- Has training to complete to meet OGC requirements
- Has to re-certify every five years
- Refresher training and keeping up with legislative changes is ongoing
- Updates on legislative changes/conditions can cause claim/changes to weighting; and it changes frequently

## Section two: Appointing a representative
- Veterans usually look for organizations vs. individuals
- Could be referered by friend (individual VSOs)
- Veterans look online; site have search tools; ususally search by ZIP or state; VSO have their own searches; results list individual reps
- Veterans call or email; general email monitored
- Most Veterans have not started the claims or appeals process; but 20% have and need help
- Before someone can represent a Veteran, they have to complete 21-22 to give VSO POA
- 21-22 is sent to VA they note the appointment, and VA grants access to Veteran records
- They inform Veteran upfront they must be given POA to represent the Veteran

## Section three: Working with Veterans


## Section four: Limits and ending appointment




Used to be a fax now is a central mail portal online import to VA
Some user their own program or site to upload 
Logs into VA access system—has to be granted by VA (what is it called?)
Paper and face-to-face so they still mail 21-22; some officers have physical location everything is handled in-person
Do not move forward with anything regarding claim until 21-22
Younger Veterans have more information upfront on CD; medical upfront
Older veterans don’t; Some info has been destroyed
May start with minimal info; may need docs from doctors and family members
Frequent contact early on; after it’s when there is an update 
Have access to VBMS to check cases
Often it’s a family member
Sometime they receive letter
Monthly contact after the initial claim input
Appeals management three to six month for initial claims
But faster than it used to be
No specialty—any kind of claims
Some orgs PBA work with paralyzed Veterans
Most common mental health conditions, physical knee back problems
Example of update linking respiratory conditions to Service, update allows this
Sometime call from veterans, so need to be educated on updates when questions come in
Veterans need to know how weighting table affect them
Only up to the board of appeals; after refer them to lawyer
Attorneys working pro bono
Other limitations issues related to state or local area—if not a VA issue they are referred
References are usually to no-cost firms
Provide list—no favoritism
Usually find out about the issue by talking to the Veteran/initial convo
Can help most veterans; some circumstances are extraordinary
Once a veteran appoints someone else, automatically terminates representation
If Veteran just wants to stop, they can; write letter to VA for processing VA will 
Knows about eBenefits, but no-one monitored system so 21-22 didn’t go any where
No one monitored it; wasn’t well managed
VSO just weren’t aware of feature, so make sure VSO knows feature is available and active and use it
Communication/meeting with VBA inform VSOs about feature
Make sure correct contact info is correct and up-to-date; many complaints
