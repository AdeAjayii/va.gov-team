## Research Goals 

The team has previously interviewed veterans about how they find and appiont reps to help them complete their claims, so the primary goal of this research was to understand how that process works from the perspective of Veterans Service Organizations and individual Veterans Service Officers. Specifically, we were interested in:
How dow an organization or individual become a VSO?
How does a Veteran or Service Member find a VSO?
Do veterans search for individual representatives or organizations? If organizations, how do they get connected to an individual?
At what point in the claims process do Veterans begin looking for a representative?
What are the limits of what a VSO can help with?
Do VSOs specialize in particular types of benefits or disabilities?

## Research Methodology 

Conversational discovery interviews were conducted remotely using Zoom’s audio capabilities. There was no screen-sharing component. Participants were recruited through internal VA contacts.

### Who we talked to

We spoke to five (5) Veterans Service Officers that represented five different Veterans Service Organizations. 
- 8-20 years of experience as VSOs
- all were also veterans
- 2 upper management/director level    `verify these numbers in notes`
- 3 currently representing clients

## Key Findings
The 5-10 top findings from your study should be listed here. Write your findings so that if someone reads only these bullets they can leave feeling they got useful information and the study was worthwhile. Examples might be "Most participants used the Search field to find the form, and searched for the term 'veteran health'" or "Most participants struggled with the secondary caregiver section on the form". See an example of this section [on the Caregiver findings document](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/caregivers/1010cg-mvp/usability-testing-jan2020/research-findings.md).

1. VSOs are largely found through word of mouth and outreach efforts.
2. VSOs want to position claims for the best chance of success and want to talk to Veterans/Service Members prior to a VA 21-22 being filed. 
3. VSOs use a mix of VA tools and tools internal to their organization
4. VSOs still rely on in person communication and paper forms, however, COVID-19 proceedures forced a move to more electronic subissions.
5. Representatives reported probelms with out of date information and submissions in eBenefits that were not reflected in SEP.
6. Ending represenation is not as clear as beginning representation.
7. VSOs really care about Veterans and work to stay up to date on details that will affect claims.


## Details of Findings
List details of each finding in top findings here, with supporting quotes when possible.

## Additional Insights
Any additional insights that aren't "top findings."

## Recommendations
There are several opportunities for further inquiry, including:
What functions are available in SEP and how it fits in to the day-to-day usage for VSOs?
What is the system of record for VSO contact information and current POA status?
How might we connect Veteran > Organization > Individual Rep more consistently?
How might we help Veterans find and understand an organization or representative’s specialty (type of disability, location, other demographic)?
