## Research Goals 

The team has previously interviewed veterans about how they find and appiont reps to help them complete their claims, so the primary goal of this research was to understand how that process works from the perspective of Veterans Service Organizations and individual Veterans Service Officers. Specifically, we were interested in:
How dow an organization or individual become a VSO?
How does a Veteran or Service Member find a VSO?
Do veterans search for individual representatives or organizations? If organizations, how do they get connected to an individual?
At what point in the claims process do Veterans begin looking for a representative?
What are the limits of what a VSO can help with?
Do VSOs specialize in particular types of benefits or disabilities?

## Research Methodology 

Conversational discovery interviews were conducted remotely using Zoom’s audio capabilities. There was no screen-sharing component. Participants were recruited through internal VA contacts.

### Who we talked to

We spoke to five (5) Veterans Service Officers that represented five different Veterans Service Organizations. 
- 8-20 years of experience as VSOs
- all were also veterans
- 2 upper management/director level    `verify these numbers in notes`
- 3 currently representing clients

### Research Questions

Research questions here

## Key Findings

1. VSOs are largely found through word of mouth and outreach efforts.
2. VSOs want to position claims for the best chance of success and want to talk to Veterans/Service Members prior to a VA 21-22 being filed. 
3. VSOs still rely on in person communication and paper forms, however, COVID-19 proceedures forced a move to more electronic subissions.
4. VSOs use a mix of VA tools and tools internal to their organization.
5. Representatives reported probelms with out of date information and submissions in eBenefits that were not reflected in SEP.
6. Ending represenation is not as clear as beginning representation.
7. VSOs really care about Veterans and work to stay up to date on details that will affect claims.


## Details of Findings
1. Every representative interviewed identified word of mouth and outreach efforts as the primary way they connect with Veterans and Service Members. Many organizations rely on regional outposts with monthly meetings and/or relationships  with medical providers to funnel Veterans to their organization. Three of the representatives mentioned outreach during TAPS, but have found that the claims process is not the highest priority during inital transition from active duty. Only two of the representatives mentioned searches on VA.gov and none mentioned OGC. 

2. Representatives estimated that 80-90% of clients begin looking for a representative before starting the claim process. Although this means they are starting with less initial information, every representataive preferred to meet with Veterans or Service Members prior to claims being started so they can position their claim for the best chance of success. Typically Veterans will be routed to individual representatives through a group that determines which department (by specialty, location, or other demographic) is best matched with them. Some of the representatives had slang terms Veterans and Service Members that change representation mid-claim, referring to them as "POA hoppers" or "POA hunters", and the behavior makes them wary. Sometimes these claims are not really related to VA benefits, or the veteran feels they should be getting more than they are. All representatives were very clear that they can consult with any Veteran or Service member, but they cannot take any action until the VA 21-22 is in place and active.

3. All representatives remarked that paper forms and in-person help is still neccessary to reach veterans, but that COVID-19 protocols had driven more of their process "online". This largely meant that they were collecting filled-in VA 21-22 forms through encrypted mail and uploading to VA through Direct Mail Upload or the Centralized Mail Portal. Using Direct Mail Upload has decreased the time it takes for a POA to be active from 10 days using fax submission to 3 days.

4. Tools mentioned include eBenefits (Veteran tool only), SEP, Direct Mail Upload, Centrailized Mail Portal (also referred to as Cenmail Protal), VetsPro, VBMS, CAG, encrypted email, paper forms, and fax. Additionally, each organiation has internal tools to manage cases. One representative mentioned creating a special "user guide" to walk Veterans through appointing a representative in eBenefits. This user guide includes screen shots of eBenefit pages, arrows pointing to menu items, and specific information to enter to find the organization.

5. Two of the representatives said their organization prefers to get VA 21-22 forms through eBenefits and SEP. After the initial consultation with a Veteran or Service Member, they will ask the client to go through eBenefits to appoint the representative. Then the representative will use SEP to finish their portion of the form and submit to VA. However, sometimes this goes wrong and the appointment does not show up in SEP. When this happens, the Veteran will have to call the helpdesk. Often they revert back to paper forms instead of waiting for digital resolution. This is especially problematic for users that are trying to change representatives during the claims process.

6. When a claim is complete, the file is no longer "active" with VA, but the represenation stays in place unless a Veteran does something to explicitly end that representation. There is not a form or formal process to do this, but the most common response was that veterans can write a letter and mail it to VA. Similarly, if a representative chooses to end a relationship, there is no formal process. As mentioned above, changing representation during a claim, or when appealling a decision, can create problems when the representation change is not coordinated.

7. Each of the representatives interviewed spoke with passion about their job and helping veterans. In addition to helping veterans, they can also help family members. They have continuing education to stay up to date on legislative changes and state benefits. Three of five representatives mentioned having systems that proactively flag clients that may be affected by program changes, or that have not had active communication in a certain amount of time. 

## Additional Insights
Any additional insights that aren't "top findings."

## Recommendations
There are several opportunities for further inquiry, including:
What functions are available in SEP and how it fits in to the day-to-day usage for VSOs?
What is the system of record for VSO contact information and current POA status?
How might we connect Veteran > Organization > Individual Rep more consistently?
How might we help Veterans find and understand an organization or representative’s specialty (type of disability, location, other demographic)?
