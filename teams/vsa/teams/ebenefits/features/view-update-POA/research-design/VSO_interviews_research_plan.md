#### Questions
- Will Perigean be scheduling these since participants are not necessarily veterans?
- Is there a typical number of participants for discovery? Is audio only typical, or was that something specific for the COE example?
- Will there be a tool for VSOs on va.gov, or is the info gathered here wrapped into the veteran’s tool?

#### Background
Establishing benefits and claims with the VA can be a lengthy and complicated process. The VA's Office of General Counsel has a list of accredited or certified individuals or groups (Veterans Service Organizations or Veterans Service Officers, VSO) that are best qualified to help Veterans in various tasks. Form 21-22/a allows users to appoint a VSO to represent them  to the VA.

Research on Veteran and Service Member experiences with finding and appointing representatives has already been completed and now we need to understand the process and experiences of the VSOs.

### Goals
The primary goal of this research is to understand how the representation/Power of Attorney (POA) process works for VSOs. Specifically, we need to know how representatives interact with service members and where there are pain points so that we can decide on content and features and design a tool that increases veterans’ success in selecting an appropriate representative for their claim.

#### Guiding questions
- How does an organization or individual become a VSO?
- How does a Veteran or Service Member find a VSO?
- Do Veterans/Service Members contact representatives for an “interview” or consultation before making a selection?
- Do representatives accept all appointments, or are there limits 
- Do Veterans/Service Members use VA Form 21-22/a? If so, do they typically submit online or on paper?
- How do representatives interact with Veterans/Service Members (phone, email, in person, etc)?
- What are the most common issues VSOs represent?
- Do representatives have different specialties or handle all kinds of claims?
- What are the limits on what representatives can help with? When would they need to decline an appointment or refer to another representative?
- How long do appointments last?
- When do appointments end? At the end of a claims process? After a certain amount of time?

#### Hypotheses

### Method
We will engage in moderated discovery interviews conducted remotely. Calls will be run using Zoom, but audio only -- there will be no video component or screen-sharing. Participants with experience applying for VA-backed loans will be recruited by Perigean. Sessions will be recorded (with permission), and observers may be in attendance.

#### The process
- There will be a quick warm-up and introduction to the discovery interview process
- The participant will be guided through a series of open-ended questions
- There will be a quick Q/A and wrap-up

#### Notetaking
We request that Perigean take notes -- verbatim if possible --  during interviews.
