# Power of Attorney and Payment History Design Recommendations
Jim Adams & Nick Wygonik

## Power of Attorney
- Make sure the Content page's FAQ helps veterans clearly understand the overall process of the form.  Veterans were confused by what the  "next steps" were after completing the form.
- Instructions should be clear and written with common, everyday verbiage. Reduce the use of legal langue to inform or to instruct Veterans. There is a high probability that Veterans will not read the legal text or struggle to comprehend it.
- Remove the Representative Search feature from the form. It may be easier to have a step where the Veteran enters the Representatives information instead of searching for it. 
   - This step caused a lot of confusion for the participants. (Maybe have a separate flow that stores the selected rep that can be applied to the form once the Veteran starts the form. )
- Break apart the Privacy Act step. Veterans saw this step as a wall to text and would not read it.  Veterans were comfortable with the Privacy Act information but did not read the Burden of Respondent. 
- Combine and auto-populate all Veteran information steps (VA File Number, Military Service, and Personal Information).
- Participants wanted the Representative Search Table also to include: a rating system based on Veteran feed-back, the Representative's specialty, Representative's Name, number of cases won, 
- Provide verbiage about the last time the table information was updated.
- Ensure that the statement below or something similar is incorporated in the Limited Consent step because Veterans understood the intent of the step after reading the statement. 
> “Though I give my consent to VA. I do NOT want to POA. Representative to access records relating to the following treatments.”
- Participants asked that Military Sexual Trauma be an included option on the Limited Consent step.
- Provided content that helps Veterans understand the benefits of allowing the Representatives to Authorization of Address Change. Veterans did not have trust in the Representative and saw this a breath of trust.  

## Payment History
- Veterans favored similar features found on their financial institution websites.  
    - Incorporate a search by a range of dates. Veterans did not know when the VA sent a payment, and a range would help them locate a payment easier than a sort feature.
    - Combine Payments and Return Payments into one leger. Veterans are familiar with a leger with debit and credits. 
    - The Disclaimer text is confusing and not poorly labeled. Creating a FAQ section may make the content more palatable.
    - Display the Veteran's financial information on the page like:  
    - The Veterans bank
    - The account linked to their direct deposit.
    - Link payments to their claims
