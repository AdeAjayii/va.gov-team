## Punchlist

### Introduction screen
- [ ] Confirm styling of info-box (Note: Since you’re signed in to your account...); should it have the info icon and different spacing?
- [ ] Change green button text to; "Apply for Veteran Readiness and Employment"
- [ ] In subway map, change first sentence under (1) Prepare to: "When you apply, be sure to have these on hand:"

- [ ] Intro copy is different from both mocks and prototype; The XD Orientation mocks have the latest
- [ ] In the wizard, the Orientation shows when “Neither” option is selected; I think the user needs to be a Veteran or service member to continue
- [ ] 2A. Other “no” responses also reveal the Orientation module; should we encourage “No” respondents to continue?
- [ ] Orientation continues to show when user backs-up to change response.
- [ ] Spacing issues throughout
- [ ] Card is oddly formatted with action link
- [ ] 5A. Should “Apply online…” text say “Apply fo Veterans…” like the second action link?
- [ ] Where did “Slide” numbers come from?
- [ ] “Orientation” sits on top of each panel… ?
- [ ] Date styling on slide 2
- [ ] Lower-case the “T” on slides 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- [ ] Agree that there should be a “done” panel/slide
- [ ] Cap “Only if different…”?
- [ ] Address block differences? “Street” vs. “Street address”; state/province/region?
- [ ] “Required” dropped to next line on moving question
- [ ] Really big text box for 1 two-digit number on years of education question
- [ ] Pre-select U.S. for country
- [ ] Bitter vs. Source Sans on Comm prefs screen
- [ ] “Choose at least 1” dropped to next line
- [ ] No status on “I live on a base” selection in the review
- [ ] Where did “By submitting this form…” come from?
- [ ] Signed-in shows profile on Vet info for User 3
