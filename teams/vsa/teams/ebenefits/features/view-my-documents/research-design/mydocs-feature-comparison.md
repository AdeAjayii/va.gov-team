### Benefits Letters

The Download VA Benefits Letters feature resides on VA.gov within the Records hub. This tool provides users with downloadable PDFs that document their VA benefits and service history.

#### Users

Judging from the documents themselves, users are primarily Veterans. Users must authenticate to view the download page.

#### Flow
There is a direct link from the "Records" white quadrant on the VA.gov homepage. There is an intermediate landing page [(Download VA benefit letters)](https://staging.va.gov/records/download-va-letters/) providing info and instructions, and prompting users to sign-in. The next screen asks for an address correction/confirmation before allowing the user to continue to the downloadable documents. Once on the documents screen, the user sees a set of accordions containing links to the corresponding PDFs.

User flow: Home >> Download VA benefit letters >> Sign-in >> VA letters and documents (address check) >> VA letters and documents 

#### Functionality
On the Download Documents screen are several accordions that reveal a link to a downloadable PDF. There are also several links to other "document" resources.
