Why we need to do this


Getting time in your Sprint for this work


Doing the work

1. Search for imports from other apps in your apps
2. Copy code being imported into a folder in your app folder. A good name for this copied folder is something like "utils" or "shared"
3. Make sure all your apps run as expected and all unit and end to end tests still pass
