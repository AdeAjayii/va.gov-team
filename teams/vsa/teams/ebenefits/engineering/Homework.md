Recently when grading a few homework assignments I came to a few realizations -
- the broad majority of our work is not Greenfield yet both homework assignments are building from scratch, these don't reflect the actual nature of our work
- one of the two homework assignments we have requires the engineer to write in vanilla JS which we generally don't use on the job, again this does not reflect the nature of our work
- neither of our homework assignments focus on UI which is one of the most important parts of front end engineering
