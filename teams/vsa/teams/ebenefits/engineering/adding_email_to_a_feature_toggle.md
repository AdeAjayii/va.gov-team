# Background
When we set up feature toggles for UAT we generally start out by adding email addresses one by one to the feature toggle for each participant. This document tell you how to add an email to a feature toggle for a participant.


## Make sure you have the ability to add emails
In order to add email addresses to a feature toggle you need to be added to [this file](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/c6d10bc0a914936c8c179517a79b74ef016dff9e/config/settings.yml#L689) in the `vets-api` repo. If you are not currently on the list in this file you can be added to the list by either a front end or back end engineer.
