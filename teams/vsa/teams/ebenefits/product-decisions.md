# The Problem
We need to build a lot of stuff for Veteran's and we need it to all be at a high quality. Our approach going forward is to achieve a pace of work that is both sustainable and is optimized for feature delivery quality and speed.

# The solution
As a team we are not to focus on more than two features inside a single sprint. This is meant to make sure that we can 1. deliver the best quality experiences for the Veterans we can and 2. deliver at the highest speed we can without getting burnt out.

We are to spend as much time is needed per feature before moving on to a subsiquent feature. We have a roadmap of what we will build in the upcoming future and the temptation is to start on all of it now. We have decided not to start on all of it now and to instead start on what is right in front of us and work on that until we either need to ship something OR we hit a complete blocker for the entire team. Some members of the team may hit blockers from time to time but this doesn't mean other diciplines should take their focus off the feature as well and further scatter our team's resources.
