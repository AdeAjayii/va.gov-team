# Authenticated experience: Proposed updated charter and future vision

**Last updated: January 24, 2023**

### This is a work in progress and is not ready for eyes or team input.

## Problems 

- Technically, VA.gov does have an authenticated experience insofar as people can login to the website and access personalized tools. However, I would argue we are currently heavier on "authenticated" and light on "experience." Logged-in, the site largely feels the same as it does logged-out. With the exception of My VA and a few minor navigational changes, most tools are buried in content pages. There is very little that provides a guided, structured experience that says to users, "this is a logged-in portal to manage your health care and benefits with VA."
- Currently, people view the My VA dashboard as *the* authenticated experience. My VA is a page, not a whole experience. Expecting it to do the lifting for the entire logged-in experience opens it to becoming a dumping ground instead of a curated part of a larger experience.
- The profile half of the authenticated experience team has, historically, needed to integrate many features from other VA tools or systems into the VA.gov website. However, as some of these tools move into more of a maintenance mode, our team is left with some open bandwidth.
