  - PM to update Contact info product outline and bad address project outline, if/as needed

  - BE to update contact info docs as needed (may not be needed for BE, but we can let Tom decide)

This really depends on what comes out of Liz and Christina's work for this sprint, so let's plan to review where they are at no later than Monday.

If applicable, finish FE updates.

This is only if there is time. We can push back a sprint if there is already too much work for Tom between our team and My VA.

**BE**

- Resume/revisit discovery on the default opt-in indicator.
  -  If this is already complete, let's talk about what needs to happen for us to consume it, as we'll eventually want to be able to utilize it once we migrate over existing email notifications from MHV.

Move over tickets from last sprint, if needed.

### Bad address indicator

- For everyone: Finish documentation updates if not done last sprint

- If there are tickets we can start to handoff from design to FE for build based on Christina's or Liz's work, let's prioritize those over general/tech-debt tickets

### Notification preferences

**Liz**

- Initial thinking: Do we need to change our edit model for notification preferences to account for additional channels and notifications?
