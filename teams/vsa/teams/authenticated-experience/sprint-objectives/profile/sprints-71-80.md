## Sprint 71 (4/6 - 4/19) 

### General

- Onboard Sharon #39204

### Personal information revisions

Goal: Finish BE and connect to frontend

**PM**

- Request QA for 5/4 - 5/17 sprint
- Finish all QA prep
- Finish call center guide

**Design**

- Finish call center guide
- If time, UAT research plan and conversation guide 

**FE**

- Start connecting frontent to backend; Finish this if possible

**BE**

- Finish BE!!

### Bad address indicator

**PM**

Note: We can move this a sprint if Sharon needs to focus on general onboarding before jumping into this task.

- Start on QA use cases (this will not be completed yet)
- Figure out how we can get a staging user with the bad address indicator for testing (might require working with VA Profile)

### Notification preferences

**PM**

- Once we have final IA/content recommendations, make sure those are communicated to VA Profile

**Design**

- Update mocks to add the new comp & pen notification
- Review with IA and content (so we can get feedback to VA Profile team)

### Address change messaging

- Continue work (may need to check in with Christina and Adam on current status)

### MHV research

- Liz to deliver final report

## Sprint 72 (4/20 - 5/3)

### Personal info revisions

Anything outstanding from sprint 71, plus...

**PM**

- Submit call center guide for review

**Design - Christina**

- Create UAT Convo Guide #39866

**FE - Adam**

Moved these from sprint 71

- Add ability to Add/Update Preferred Name #38953
- Add ability to Add/Update Gender Identity #38952

**Everyone**

- Once the feature is fully complete in staging, everyone on the project (Sharon, Christina, Adam, Tom) should go into staging and review the feature to make sure it's ready for QA. Note that this might need to get moved to the beginning of sprint 73 before QA.

### Bad address indicator

**PM**

- Start on QA use cases #39379
  - This likely will not be completed this sprint
  - Talk to Tom/Marci about which test user to use. I think Tom worked with VA Profile already to get one set up.
- Document Staging user info for flag #39380

**Design - Christina**

- Create high fidelity mockups

**BE - Tom**

Tom should finish all backend work for personal information revisions first. So, if there is still outstanding work from sprint 71 or other odds and ends that aren't on my radar, he should do that first before moving on to bad address indicator work.

- Work on bad address indicator emails
  - Initial email blast that will go out to everyone with the BAI once the functionality launches
  - Individual emails that will go out to folks if a new BAI is added to their accounts *after* we launch the feature

### Address change messaging

- Is this work finished?

### MHV profile research

**Design - Liz**

- Share results with OCTO
- Share results with MHV team/stakeholders

### Notification prefs

- If we didn't finish the content/IA request from sprint 71, we need to finish that and get recommended content/IA back to VA Profile. Otherwise, nothing for this project this sprint.

### General

- Will likely need to find additional work for Mark
