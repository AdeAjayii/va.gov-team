- QA planning
  - **We only need to test the comp & pen integration since the education integration was NOT updated**.

  - [Here is some test case documentation we already have put together](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/vagov-users/staging-test-accounts-direct-deposit.md).  This is a good place to start, but I can almost guarantee it needs to be reviewed and validated, especially for appropriate staging user info.
