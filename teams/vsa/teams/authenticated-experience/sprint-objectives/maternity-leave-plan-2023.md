# Samara's 2023 maternity leave plan

Roughly, this will be some time between March - June of 2023, depending on when the baby arrives.

## Top priorities

### Secondary priorities

## For OCTO

These are things that I have my eye on that need to be kept up with by whoever my OCTO replacement(s) is/are:

### MHV: Integrating their interface with VA Profile

In order for VA.gov to incorporate the MHV notification preferences into our interface, MHV has to integrate their interface with the VA Profile backend for both contact information and notification preferences. I need someone on the OCTO side of things to keep up with Carnetta and the VA Profile team (Mike Richards etc) to make sure the MHV side of things is moving along. VA Profile's work on this is easy -- they already support contact info, and they have been able to get the MHV notification preferences in the backend fairly easily. Keeping up on what MHV is doing and making sure that is moving along is the harder part, and is what is a large dependecy for us to update the VA.gov interface.

### Any requests that come in from other teams

We already have a packed quarter for when I am out. If there are requests that come in, please slot those in to planning with the help of PMs **if time allows**. If the team is full and does not have bandwidth, do not hesitate to communicate that to stakeholders and work to figure out on what timeline we might be able to get to the work. The auth exp team is very capable, and I trust them to communicate when they do and do not have bandwidth accurately, so please trust them.
