## Sprint 71 (4/6 - 4/19) 

[#37608](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/37608)

- If applicable: Add Columbus, OH to list of Cerner facilities #38551

### General

- Welcome back AJ :) #39292

### Payment info

- Updates from staging review, if necessary #39521
- If all is good to go, recruit and hold UAT #38194
- PM: During UAT, make sure we can see analytics coming in for new links #39280
  - [Use this report](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&_r.drilldown=analytics.pagePath:www.va.gov~2Fmy-va~2F,analytics.eventCategory:Interactions) and make sure you see [all new links for which we've added tracking](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/37589).
  - You'll need to filter the report to add between 100 - 250 results, since the new links will only have been clicked a handful of times during UAT.
  - Success: We see data coming in for all new links.
  - Only do this if we hold UAT this sprint

  - Each section should always appear on the page
  - Each section should have the following: loading state; blank state(s); content state(s); error state(s). Note: the nametag might be a little different, as there's never a totally blank state, and we don't show big error alerts for content we can't load.
