## Sprint 71 (4/6 - 4/19) 

[#37608](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/37608)

- If applicable: Add Columbus, OH to list of Cerner facilities #38551

### General

- Say goodbye to Heather :(
- Welcome back AJ :) #39292

### Payment info

- Updates from staging review, if necessary #39521
- If all is good to go, recruit and hold UAT #38194
- PM: During UAT, make sure we can see analytics coming in for new links #39280
  - [Use this report](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/#/report/content-event-pages/a50123418w177519031p176188361/explorer-table.plotKeys=%5B%5D&_r.drilldown=analytics.pagePath:www.va.gov~2Fmy-va~2F,analytics.eventCategory:Interactions) and make sure you see [all new links for which we've added tracking](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/37589).
  - You'll need to filter the report to add between 100 - 250 results, since the new links will only have been clicked a handful of times during UAT.
  - Success: We see data coming in for all new links.
  - Only do this if we hold UAT this sprint

### On-site notifications

**PM**

- VANotify to start work; evaluate what they need to do so we can plan our own timelines
- Do we have a plan for QA? How are we going to trigger a notification for testing? #34543

**Design**

- Explore notification style so we don't have to use the alert/error styling #39090

**Medical co-pays/debts**

- TBD. Need to figure out if we need more explorations or if we have designs ready for testing. (#38984 exploration continues)

### My VA audit

**Design**

- Audit health care #39050
- Audit benefit payments and debts #39051
- Audit applications in progress #39052
- If time, regroup with Samara/AJ (or Heather if she is still here) on existing states #39285

- Monitor launch to 50%
- *For V2 updates*: Collab cycle kickoff
- *For V2 updates*: Collab cycle design intent

**FE**

- Flip feature flag for launch to 25%
- Flip feature flag for launch to 50%
- Don't show an error message if people have no payment history at the VA ([Slack convo](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1649873367021449))

**Design**

- *For V2 updates*: Collab cycle design intent

### On-site notifications

VANotify to complete their work in the next two sprints

**PM**

- Determine QA plan (4/20 meeting)
- Determine if there is any way to do UAT on this feature

**FE**

- Connect frontend to backend (if it didn't happen in sprint 71)

### My VA health care seciton: Cerner launch

- Add Columbus to list of facilities that see Cerner alert. #38551

### My VA health care section: Update "Next Appointment" connection

**FE**

- Discovery: Update Next Appointment feature to connect to V2 of VAOS
  - [V0 docs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/vaos/app/docs/vaos/v0/vaos.yaml)
  - [V2 docs](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api/blob/master/modules/vaos/app/docs/vaos/v2/vaos_v2.yaml)
 - If possible, make this update

## Sprint 73 (5/4 - 5/17)

[#39608](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/39608)

### My VA: Benefit payments & debts

**Design**

- *For V2*: Updates coming out of the design intent (this assumes design intent happened in sprint 72)

**FE**

- *For V1*: Launch to 100%

### My VA: Audit

**Design**

- Review audit with team to make sure nothing is missing

### On-site notifications: MVP

**PM**

- Regroup to figure out if we need to remove debt alert in benefit payments and debts before notifications launch
  - This is because of analytics tracking -- I'm unsure whether we can track clicks into the debt tool separately for each alert.
- Figure out QA plan with DMC (backend team)

**FE**

- Continue/finish frontend, including handling of multiple alerts

## Sprint 74 (5/18 - 5/31)
[Epic: #40777](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40777)

### Payment and debts section

We'll continue to monitor analytics for V1, but otherwise, these tasks are all for V2:

**PM**

**Design**

- Design updates if they didn't happen or weren't finished in sprint 73
- Work with PM to submit sitewide content/IA review
- Research planning -- what kind of research do we need, and when should we do it?

### My VA health care section

- Launch Next Appointment update when VAOS V2 goes out
  - We can move this to the following sprint if the VAOS team is not launching before the end of May

### My VA audit

**Design**

- If the audit is done, Angela should share it with the team
- If it's not done, let's talk about what still needs to happen

### My VA redirect

## Sprint 75 (6/1 - 6/14)
[Epic: #40784](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40784)

### PTO

- **Liz**: 6/1 - 6/6
- **Samara**: Afternoon of 6/14
- **Taylor**: 6/6 - 6/10

### Priorities

In order of importance, in case it's needed:

1. On-site notifications
2. Cerner updates
3. My VA redirect
4. Payment info V2
5. Audit updates

There are *a lot* of PM tasks this sprint. The sprint is mostly PM stuff moving along each project. We should talk about how this work can be divided among AJ, Erica, and Samara (as needed).

Also, besides the Cerner updates, I don't have any frontend priorities for Taylor right now. If there are no carryover tickets from last sprint or FE tickets in the backlog, please check in with the engineering lead to get him some work for this sprint.

### On-site notifications

Goal: Be ready for QA by 6/15

**PM**

- Request QA from Tze
- Figure out how to get the backend (DMC) to support test users
- Coordinate QA with all necessary parties
- QA go/no-go

### Cerner updates

**FE**

- Add the following facilities to the list of Cerner sites for My VA
  - (692) White City/Roseburg: Go-live -- 6/11/2022 (Note: not clear to me whether these are separate or one health system)
  - (653) Roseburg: Go-live -- 6/11/2022

### My VA redirect

**PM**

- Assuming we may not get the Sprint 74 tasks done with AJ needing to take some sick time, so let's move the sprint 74 tasks into sprint 75

**Design - Liz**

- UAT/research planning

### Payments and debts V2

Design on hold while we prep for midpoint review

**PM**

- Midpoint review prep, including starting a preliminary list of QA tasks
- Hold midpoint review by the end of the sprint if possible

### Audit updates

**PM**

- Collab cycle kickoff

**Design - Angela**

- Finish use cases if they aren't done
- Outline design updates
- Start on design updates

## Sprint 76 (6/15 - 6/28)
[Epic: #40785](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/issues/40785)

### PTO

- **Tom**: 6/17 - 6/24 (this might affect end-to-end testing for on-site notifications)

Projects are in priority order:

### On-site notifications

**Full team**

- End-to-end testing. How we are going to handle this:
  -  Once VANotify has completed their backend testing, we will ask DMC to add the test data for a subset of staging users. If we can then validate that on-site notifications showed up in those accounts as expected, there is no need to hold an e2e call.
  -  However, if we ask DMC to add debts and no on-site notification shows up, we should hold a call to troubleshoot the issue. 

**PM**

- Hold QA go/no-go
- Fill out release plan
- Support call center guide updates

**Design**

- Call center guide updates (can use My VA guide) 

**QA**

- Tze to conduct QA

### My VA redirect

This assumes discovery is complete. If we need additional discovery and have unanswered questions after sprint 75, we should prioritize getting those answers.

**PM**

- General coordination

**FE**

- Code implementation (other teams may need to be involved in this)

**Design -- Liz**

- UAT planning

### My VA: Cerner updates

**FE**

- (531) Boise: Go-live -- 6/25/2022

### Payments V2

Design is on hold bc of midpoint review

**PM**

- Midpoint review prep, including starting a preliminary list of QA tasks
- Hold midpoint review by the end of the sprint if possible

### Audit

**Design**

- Design for Claim status & health care sections
