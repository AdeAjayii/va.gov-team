*V2*

**Goal**: Team discovery and kickoff

**PM & team**

- Meeting: Team kickoff for our team (not collab cycle)
  - What is in scope? What is out of scope?
  - What can we accomplish in 3 months (pre-Samara's maternity leave)? 6 months?
- Meeting: Start talking to VANotify about this effort
  - Ask about their intake process for new notifications
- Meeting: Start discuss notification center concept
  - A notification center is out of scope for V2, but we may want to incorporate discovery for a notification center into V2
  - What do we need to answer to determine if this is the right path? How do we do this without being too leading in research?
- Figure out what relevant notifications VANotify supports now

**FE**
