## Q3 2021 (July - September) goals

**Samara will be out for most of this quarter**.

### My VA

- **My VA 2.0 redesign**
  - Complete phased launch
- [Track My VA 2.0 project KPIs for 3 month post-launch](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va#measuring-success)
- Options for additional work:
  - **Option A**: Scope out an MVP for elevating action items, and start build.
  - **Option B**: Discovery on what additional information we can/should add next to the dashboard (eg. payment history and financial info; education info; other benefit info, etc).

### VA.gov Profile: Communications permissions (notification preferences)

- Complete build
- QA and all pre-launch checklist items
- UAT
- Launch MVP of communication permissions (notification preferences)

**Note**: This work is dependent on VA Profile, VANotify, and VEText meeting their own milestones. [Here is the estimated long term plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/authenticated-experience/sprint-objectives/Long%20term%20project%20planning.xlsx). Please feel free to adjust as necessary given reality as time goes on.

### VA.gov Profile: Preferred medical facility

- Complete build
- QA and all pre-launch checklist items
- UAT
- Launch preferred medical facility functionaity before end of the quarter

**Note**: This is a cross-team effort with VAOS. [Here is the estimated long term plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/authenticated-experience/sprint-objectives/Long%20term%20project%20planning.xlsx). Please feel free to adjust as necessary given reality as time goes on.

### VA.gov Profile: User roles & permissions

- If it was not done in Q2, the identity team needs to define the user stories and flows for the MVP and communicate these to the auth experience team.
- Based on these user flows, we will determine what, if any, updates need to happen to the VA.gov profile and My VA dashboard as a result.
  -  **Note**: You do not have to be a Veteran to have a profile or dashboard. Currently, anyone can log in and see a profile and dashboard even if they aren't a Veteran. Create an account in prod and try it for yourself! I say this because **the user roles and permissions work might not require profile and My VA work**. Please let legitimate user flows/stories guide whether we need to make updates to these sections at this time.
