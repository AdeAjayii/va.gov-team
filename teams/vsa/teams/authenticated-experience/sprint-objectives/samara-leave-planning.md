# Long term planning for Samara's maternity leave

## Q2 2021 (April – June) goals

### My VA

- **2.0 redesign**: Finish build; QA; VSP reviews; UAT; Begin phased launch
- Run experiment(s) on how we can better elevate action items
  - **Objectives**: Evaluate patterns with real users that will allow us to more effectively elevate action items on My VA
  - **Additional info**
    - Action items, ie. items on which the VA needs action from a veteran to move a process forward, are the most important thing that veterans want to see on their dashboard. However, action items are currently spread throughout My VA, and as we add functionality over time, it could be hard to find specific action needed items, especially if they are buried at the bottom of My VA. We should explore how we can more effectively elevate action items in order to create a scalable strategy. 
    - The debt management team has been reaching out to us since spring 2021 about adding a debt-related notification to My VA. This could be something to consider in any experiments or updates. Or, we already have two notifications on the dashboard — "You have X unread messages" and claim status updates. These could also be good starting points.
  - **Potential plan**
    - Short discovery on how action items are surfaced on other websites/tools. There may already be some good documentation on this from Liz's initial My VA discovery.
    - Low-fi sketching/mockups: Iterate on a few ideas. Also think about how or if this might change the current design, and in what ways.
    - Figure out best method for testing — is it usability testing? Click testing? Moderated or unmoderated?
    - Run research.
    - Write up and recommendations for potential implementation into the My VA experience.

### VA.gov Profile: Communications permissions (notification preferences)

- Get final details from VA Profile, design, build

### VA.gov Profile: Preferred medical facility

- Design,research, begin build

### VA.gov Profile: User roles & permissions

- According to Christine Dillman, the MVP use case is for dependents and the functionality they need is to view their benefit letter.
- They are going to start scoping this feature on 5.5.21, including all discovery work that is needed.
- It is unclear what the expectations are or will be for the profile and My VA dashboard. It is also unclear who defines that.
- However, we can likely get Lihan in this quarter to help with discovery and integration work.

## Q3 2021 (July - September) goals*

### My VA

- **My VA 2.0 redesign**: Complete launch
- [Track My VA 2.0 project KPIs for 3 month post-launch](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va#measuring-success)
- Options for additional work:
  - **Option A**: Scope out an MVP for elevating action items, and start build.
  - **Option B**: Discovery on what additional information we can/should add next to the dashboard (eg. payment history and financial info; education info; other benefit info, etc).

### VA.gov Profile: Communications permissions (notification preferences)

- Launch MVP of communication permissions (notification preferences)

**Note**: This work is dependent on VA Profile, VANotify, and VEText meeting their own milestones. [Here is the estimated long term plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/authenticated-experience/sprint-objectives/Long%20term%20project%20planning.xlsx). Please feel free to adjust as necessary given reality as time goes on.

### VA.gov Profile: Preferred medical facility

- Launch preferred medical facility functionaity before end of the quarter

**Note**: This is a cross-team effort with VAOS. [Here is the estimated long term plan](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/authenticated-experience/sprint-objectives/Long%20term%20project%20planning.xlsx). Please feel free to adjust as necessary given reality as time goes on.
