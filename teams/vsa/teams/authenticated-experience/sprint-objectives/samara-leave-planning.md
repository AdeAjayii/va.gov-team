# Long term planning for Samara's maternity leave

## Q2 2021 (April â€“ June) goals

**Samara will be out at the end of this quarter**.

### My VA

- **2.0 redesign**: Finish build; QA; VSP reviews; UAT; Begin phased launch
- [Run experiment(s) on how we can better elevate action items](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/action-items-discovery)
 
### VA.gov Profile: Communications permissions (notification preferences)

- Get final details from VA Profile, design, build

### VA.gov Profile: Preferred medical facility

- Design,research, begin build

### VA.gov Profile: User roles & permissions

- According to Christine Dillman, the MVP use case is for dependents and the functionality they need is to view their benefit letter.
- They are going to start scoping this feature on 5.5.21, including all discovery work that is needed.
- It is unclear what the expectations are or will be for the profile and My VA dashboard. It is also unclear who defines that.
- However, we can likely get Lihan in this quarter to help with discovery and integration work.

- Options for additional work:
  - **Option A**: Scope out an MVP for elevating action items, and start build.
  - **Option B**: Discovery on what additional information we can/should add next to the dashboard (eg. payment history and financial info; education info; other benefit info, etc).
