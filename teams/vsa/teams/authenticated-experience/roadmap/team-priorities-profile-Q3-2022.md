# Profile team priorities through Q3 2022 (July - September)

## Wins in Q2 2022 (April - June 2022)

We did a lot, including:

- Launched the ability to view and update preferred name and gender identity in the profile.
- Removed logic to show the direct deposit section conditionally.
- Thoroughly documented the direct deposit section.
- Audited the MHV profile, and presented findings to stakeholders.
- Removed the requirement for the international postal code.

...and much, much more that is still ongoing. Great work, team!

## Work winding down in early Q3

- **Personal information revisions**: We need to finish some post-launch tickets, submitt for 508 review, and thoroughly document our work in Github.
- **Military information integration through VA Profile**: We need to conduct UAT, then we are ready for launch followed by documentation.
- **Confirmation to update mailing address after updating home address**: This should launch right at the beginning of July.

## Upcoming work for Q3 2022 

### Bad address indicator

We are about to go into usability testing, followed by research updates, QA, and pre-launch. Unless unforeseen issues come up, We'll likely have this out before the end of the quarter.

### Notification preferences

Work is ongoing here, though there is nothing that needs immediate action. In the coming weeks, we anticipate updates to add an opt-in/opt-out to receive the 1095B tax form digitally. Additionally, Liz, Sharon, and Samara will be working with MHV stakeholders to define technical needs for migrating MHV notification preferences over to he VA.gov profile. 

### Feature documentation

This is some of the most important work we'll do this summer. My goal is that we have thorough documentation for the entire profile by the end of the quarter. Liz has already done a fantastic job of documenting the direct deposit functionality, but this work is too big to just fall on the designers on our team. We'll need everyone to participate so we have clear and easy-to-update documentation for all our features going forward, so that no knowledge lives solely in anyone's heads.

### Accessibility audit & updates

We should consolidate all accessibility feedback we've gotten, review it, and determine next steps. Tasks run from full-on projects (eg. moving edit from in-line to another page) to smaller tasks we can knock out as time allows.

### Forms system updates

A new version of the forms system is ready, so we need to update the profile so that it's using this new version. This might also help us with some accessibility wins!
