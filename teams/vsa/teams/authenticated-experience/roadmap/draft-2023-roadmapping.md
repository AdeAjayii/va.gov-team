# Authenticated experience 2023 roadmapping

### This is a draft document which is not ready to be shared with the team. Information in here may change drastically as we gather details from other teams.

## Q1 CY2023 (January - March)

### My VA and Onsite Notifications team

#### [My VA audit updates](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2022-audit#readme)

**OCTO objective**: Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience

This work is carrying over from Q4 CY2022. We are making some major improvements to UX and accessibility on My VA by making it so all sections show all the time, improving consistency, and removing some overly-nuanced personalization that made the page more complex without adding enough value.

**Expected launch date**: Late March/Early April 2023.

#### [Onsite notifications V2: Scale notifications feature](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/onsite-notifications/notifications-v2#readme)

**OCTO objective**: Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience

The onsite notifications MVP launched in October 2022, and we are now ready to scale this feature. While we're still scoping this work, we'll likely tackle overall governance and adding at least 1 new notification.

**Expected launch date**: We are still scoping this work, so launches will depend on final scope. I'd at least like us to launch something in the first three months of the year, even if that means dividing this work into phases that extend beyond Q1.

### Profile team

TBD, but likely finishing up accessibility work, adding email as a channel to notification preferences (may require research/exploration).

### Either team

#### Wayfinding research

**OCTO objectives**: Refresh the VA.gov homepage and information architecture; Integrate health portal features into VA.gov

As part of the health apartment migration, Mikki will be conducting wayfinding research. Mikki's vision includes building a prototype that reconciles the homepage, My VA, and health landing pages to see where and how people expect to find information and where they get confused. This may involve someone from our team needing to mockup or modify designs. Unclear to me if our team would need to be involved in moderating research or not.

## Q2 CY2023 (April - June)

Samara's maternity leave!! I'll be out most of this quarter.

## Q3 CY2023 (July - September)
## Q4 CY2023 (October - December)

---------------

## Work that's happening, but we are not sure when

### My VA and Onsite Notifications team

#### Incorporating health features into My VA as MHV features are migrated to VA.gov

**OCTO objective**: Integrate health portal features into VA.gov

This could be as small as updating links, or as big as adding new modules as features move over from MHV. I believe initial features/updates might include secure messaging and medical records.

#### Adding a new user role/experience to VA.gov

**OCTO objective**: Improve the Veteran login experience

It is likely we'll start work on a new user role experience in VA.gov before the end of the calendar year, though unlikely within the first half of 2023 [Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/G9TV2B50E/p1666828006560949?thread_ts=1666795077.350119&cid=G9TV2B50E). This will likely require updates to My VA.

### Profile team

#### [Incorporating MHV notification preferences into the VA.gov profile](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/tree/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/notification-preferences/mhv-notification-preferences-migration#readme)

**OCTO objective**: Integrate health portal features into VA.gov

We are currently determining the strategy for migrating notification preferences, which will determine on what timeline this work happens. Work may happen sooner rather than later if we opt to integrate with MHV first before VA Profile; It may happen later in the year, or even in 2024, if MHV needs to integrate with VA Profile before we do from the VA.gov interface.  

#### Adding a new user role/experience to VA.gov

**OCTO objective**: Improve the Veteran login experience

It is likely we'll start work on a new user role experience in VA.gov before the end of the calendar year, though unlikely within the first half of 2023 [Slack](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/G9TV2B50E/p1666828006560949?thread_ts=1666795077.350119&cid=G9TV2B50E). This will likely require updates to the VA.gov profile.
  
#### Adding eBenefits notification preferences into VA.gov 

**OCTO objective**: Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience

In partnership with VANotify (leading this work) and VA Profile, we have been talking to eBenefits stakeholders about consolidating and moving over a bunch of benefit recommendation emails supported on eBenefits to VANotify. Preferences would be stored in VA Profile and need to be viewable and editable from VA.gov.

#### Additional potential projects

- Adding "pronouns" and "sexual orientation" to the VA.gov profile **if** those fields get PRA approval.
- Adding new fields to the military information section of the profile to support PACT Act ([Details](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/G03HQ55DC/p1667569982198959)).
- Investigating if the profile should have a way to view dependent information.

### Either team

#### General authenticated IA/navigation work

**OCTO objective**: Refresh the VA.gov homepage and information architecture

The wayfinding research mentioned above is only the first step in a larger effort to improve the overall experience of navigating VA.gov, especially for logged-in users trying to get to tools and tasks. We don't know what the entirety of this work will look like now, but we can anticipate our team and others being involved to support Mikki in this work.
