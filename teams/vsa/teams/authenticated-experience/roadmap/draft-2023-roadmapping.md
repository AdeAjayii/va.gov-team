# 2023 roadmapping

### This is a draft document which is not ready to be shared with the team. Information in here may change drastically as we gather details from other teams.

## Known 2023 priorities

The following are the priorities that were discussed at the October 2022 OCTO offsite for 2023 that will or might require work from the authenticated experience team:

### Integrate health portal features into VA.gov

Potential projects and work for our team includes:

- Incorporating notification preferences for health features that will be integrated in 2023
  - Potential features: Secure messaging and medical records
- Updating My VA to accommodate new features
  - This could be as small as updating links, or as big as adding new modules

### Improve the Veteran login experience

Potential projects and work for our team includes:

- Updating both the profile and My VA to account for a delegate experience.

### Refresh the VA.gov homepage and information architecture

Potential projects and work for our team includes:

- Research and/or design work with Mikki around creating a more holistic logged-in experience

### Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience

Potential projects and work for our team includes:

- Scaling on-site notifications
- Ongoing maintenance and updates to notification preferences, either health apartment-related or not
- Adding "pronouns" and "sexual orientation" to the VA.gov profile **if** those fields get PRA approval
- Persistently showing all sections of My VA and simplifying personalized logic (aka My VA audit updates)
