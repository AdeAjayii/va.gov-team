# 2023 roadmapping

### This is a draft document which is not ready to be shared with the team. Information in here may change drastically as we gather details from other teams.

## Known 2023 priorities

The following are the priorities that were discussed at the October 2022 OCTO offsite for 2023 that will or might require work from the authenticated experience team:

### Integrate health portal features into VA.gov

Potential projects and work for our team includes:

- Incorporating notification preferences for health features that will be integrated in 2023
  - Potential features: Secure messaging and medical records
- Updating My VA to accommodate new features
  - This could be as small as updating links, or as big as adding new modules

#### What we know now

It is unlikely that we will need to launch any changes to the notification preferences section of the profile until CY Q4 2023 at the earliest. [From Lauren via Slack on 10/26/22](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C02BTDTEPNH/p1666797451568699?thread_ts=1666728785.285899&cid=C02BTDTEPNH):

> I would love to be in a place where both appointments and medical records are in phase 2 by this time next year. Stretch goal - pharmacy and secure messages in Phase 0 or 1.

So, while we don't want to wait to start development until then, we likely won't need to work on this in CY Q1 2023. This is something that the team should start visiting with VA Profile and MHV no later than CY Q2 2023 so that preferences are ready and waiting for when they are needed.

### Improve the Veteran login experience

Potential projects and work for our team includes:

- Updating both the profile and My VA to account for a delegate experience.

### Refresh the VA.gov homepage and information architecture

Potential projects and work for our team includes:

- Research and/or design work with Mikki around creating a more holistic logged-in experience

### Enhance Veterans' personalized online experience

Potential projects and work for our team includes:

- Scaling on-site notifications
- Ongoing maintenance and updates to notification preferences, either health apartment-related or not
- Adding "pronouns" and "sexual orientation" to the VA.gov profile **if** those fields get PRA approval
- Persistently showing all sections of My VA and simplifying personalized logic (aka My VA audit updates)
