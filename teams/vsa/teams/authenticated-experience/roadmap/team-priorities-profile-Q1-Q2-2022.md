# Profile team priorities through Q1 - Q2 2022 (January - June) 

### [Update personal information section of the profile: Add LGBTQ data points](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/profile/personal-information/personal-information-revision/README.md)

We are integrating preferred name, pronouns, gender identity, and sexual orientation into the VA.gov profile as part of a request from VEO and the LGBTQ Health Services office. This effort will allow veterans to more accurately define themselves within the VA, and it will help mitigate issues around veterans showing up to health appointments and being addressed improperly.

**Targeted launch**: End of Q1 2022

### Bad address indicator

Even with the addition of email and text communications at the VA, mail is still a primary form of communication for the organization. This makes it especially important that the VA has accurate and valid mailing addresses for all veterans. To further support accurate mailing addresses and reduce incidences of returned or unreceived mail, we would like to add a bad address indicator to the profile to let people know that they should check to make sure the VA has their most up-to-date address. This will work in tandem with the address validation functionality already supported in the VA.gov profile.

**Targeted launch**: Q2 2022

Other potential efforts

- Integrate military information through VA Profile backend (currently integrates through eMIS)
  - Samara attending an introductory meeting about this on 1/26
- Research effort: research how to reconcile MHV and VA.gov profiles for eventual move of MHV into VA.gov
- Research effort: Where does "sex assigned at birth" information come from, and what does it actually represent (eg. sex on birth certificate)?
