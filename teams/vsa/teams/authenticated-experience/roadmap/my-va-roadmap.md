## Completed projects

|Project|Status|
|----|----|
|[My VA 2.0 redesign](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/logged-in-homepage/2.0-redesign/README.md) | Launch completed July 2021 |

## Priorities

1. Elevate action items on My VA (Note: An action item is something a veteran needs to do while on VA.gov to apply for/track/manage benefits)
2. Show benefit status by continuing to integrate health/benefit information into My VA in a curated way

## Requests from other teams

|Project|Initiating team|Date of request| Status/Notes|
|----|----|----|----|
|How do we communicate health care application updates?| Auth exp | N/A | This would be an extension of the [duplicate health care application status](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/health-care/application/va-application/product/181023hcachanges.md) work. On the old My VA, we showed people's health care application status. For reasons, we removed this from My VA 2.0, though the most important part of the project/info still lives in the health care application itself. However, this would be GREAT information to email to people and might be something the HCA team could work on with VANotify. Idk that auth experience would do this work, but tracking it here so I don't forget.|
|Debt notifications| Leah Keeler/Benefits & Memorials team|3.1.21| The debt team would like to elevate debt-related notifications on the My VA dashboard. However, the My VA notification is not a dependency for this team's launch. They are able to continue develoment on their tool while we finish the My VA 2.0 design. [Slack convo](https://dsva.slack.com/archives/C909ZG2BB/p1614612187092100)|
|My VA 2.0 â€” Next round of features | Auth exp | N/A | Based on [discovery work](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/discovery-summary.md#veterans-care-about-anything-they-have-in-flight-whether-that-is-education-or-other-benefits), [initial usability testing](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/product/Research%20V2/MyVA2-research-findings.md#features-users-expected-to-see-that-were-missing), and Tressa's recent ["mini usability" study](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/identity-personalization/my-va/2.0-redesign/discovery-and-research/MyVA-mini-usability/My%20VA-mini-usability-findings.md), we know that people expect to see information on all of their benefits on the My VA dashboard, not just disability and health care. This is especially true for people who don't have disability or health care, making the new My VA 2.0 pretty useless. We should do some discovery into what other benefit information we can add to the My VA dashboard that would more holistically reflect people's VA status. Top contenders that people keep mentioning are education and payment history |
|Check-in Experience| Ming Ligh/Patrick Bateman | Original request: 5.24.21 Update from Patrick: 11.17.21 | Ming said the following via DM in Slack: "When you are ready to include any pre-appointment task on MyVA, the Check In Experience team would probably like to talk you about it. We have not done any discovery in this areas so would be great to combine efforts. Patrick Bateman is working on Check In Experience. Update from Patrick makes it sounds like they aren't sure if My VA will need to be involved, but that's TBD: "we want the veteran to encounter that health form during the larger check in transaction and don't believe they will just happen across an alert that takes them there [to My VA]." He also mentioned they are still far from delivering online form experiences. |
