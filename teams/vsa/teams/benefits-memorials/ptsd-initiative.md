## Problem Statement

Although the questions presented through the user interview process are the same questions that are found on VA Form 21-0781 and 0781a, asking the Veteran to relive some of the most traumatic events of their life can be problematic when they aren’t also supported by clinical staff or personnel that can address issues that arise while recounting these events. 


### Evidence of the problem
One of the challenges that we’ve encountered/witnessed through usability testing with Veterans and Service members is that the type of questions we’re currently asking in the user interview process can be triggering for Veterans.
