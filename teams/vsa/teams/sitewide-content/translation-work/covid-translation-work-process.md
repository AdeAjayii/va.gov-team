# Process for updating COVID-19 pages

This is the process to follow when we have updates to any of our COVID-19 pages that we also have translated content for:
- [Coronavirus FAQs](https://www.va.gov/coronavirus-veteran-frequently-asked-questions)
- [COVID-19 vaccines at VA](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/)
- [About COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/about-covid-19-vaccine/)
- [COVID-19 booster shots and additional doses](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/booster-shots-and-additional-doses/)
- [How to get your COVID-19 vaccine records online](https://www.va.gov/health-care/covid-19-vaccine/vaccine-record/)

1. Danielle updates the content. Depending on the updates and how quickly they need to be published, her changes can be in a Word doc or in a Drupal page.
2. The copy editor does a copy edit of the content (either in a Word doc or in Drupal).
3. Danielle sends the updates for JTF approval.
4. Once approved, Danielle makes any necessary changes and the copy editor does a final read and publishes the page.
5. Once the page is published, the copy editor creates a Word doc to send to the translation team. Provide the link to the page with updates. Copy the paragraph that contains updates and be sure to include any H2s or H3s that will help identify where on the page the changes are. Highlight eacg full sentence that is changing.
6. Send the Word doc to the translation team and ask for translations in both Spanish and Tagalog.
7. Also once the English page is published, a content team member makes any necessary changes to the chatbot.
8. The copy editor reviews the chatbot changes and approves the PR.
9. The content team member who made the changes to the chatbot alerts the chatbot team in their Slack channel (#covid-19-chatbots) that the PR can be merged.
10. Once the translation comes back, a content team member inputs the changes to both the Spanish and Tagalog pages. 
11. The copy editor reviews these pages, making sure all the translated content has been added to the page. They also review the page for any errors with spacing, capitalization, and punctuation and makes sure all links are working. 
12. The copy editor publishes the page.
13. Once the page is live, the copy editor sends links of the live pages to the volunteer translation team, and points out where on the page changes were made. The volunteer translation team reviews the content to make sure there are no egregious errors and the content matches the meaning on the English page. 
14. A content team member enters any changes from the volunteer translation team's review.
15. The copy editor reviews the changes and publishes the page.
