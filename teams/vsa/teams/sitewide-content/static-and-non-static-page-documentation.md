# The difference between VA.gov static and non-static pages

## What is a static page?

A static page displays the same information to all users on VA.gov. We also call this an unauthenticated page. A user doesn’t need to sign in to access any part of the page.

These pages are owned by Public Websites, and Sitewide Content manages the content. Static pages are built in Drupal with a few exceptions. 

To review a static page before it’s on production, use a Drupal preview link. Drupal preview only works on the VA network. 

Types of static pages on VA.gov:
- **Benefit hub landing pages.** These are the main page of each benefit area (/disability, /health-care, /education, etc.).
- **Benefit detail pages.** These are the pages within each benefit hub. 
- **Tool landing pages.** These pages contain a button, action link, or react widget that takes a user to a tool or application. They often have an H1 that starts with “How to apply” or “How to file.”
- **Resources and support.** These pages can be found at va.gov/resources.
- **Root-level pages that don’t require sign-in.** Some examples are /contact-us and /coronavirus-veteran-frequently-asked-questions.

## What is a non-static page?

A non-static page on VA.gov is customized to the user, who may need to log in to access information or complete a task. It can display differently to different users in different situations. We also call this an authenticated page. 

Product teams are responsible for non-static pages. They’re not built in Drupal.  

To review a non-static page before it’s on production, use staging.va.gov. You may need to use a test user account to access all parts of the page. 

Types of non-static pages on VA.gov:
- Tool pages
- Online form or application pages
- Online form or application intro pages
