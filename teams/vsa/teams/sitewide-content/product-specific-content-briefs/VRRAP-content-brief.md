# VA.gov content brief for VRRAP

**Created by the VA.gov sitewide content team for the Benefits/Education/BAH team, 4/2021.**

**Questions about this brief?**

## Overview

Speaking plainly, compassionately, and consistently across VA.gov helps us build trust with Veterans, service members, and their family members. This brief will help your team create content for your product that aligns with the VA.gov voice and content standards. It will also help us all track content decisions so we can all stay aligned from discovery through post-launch iterations. This is a living document. We’ll work with your team to update it as we go.

## Established content standards for this product/benefit area

[list of established terms/phrases/etc]

## The 5 basics 

Follow these content style best practices:
- **Use contractions** to achieve a conversational voice and tone (this helps avoid formal-sounding language). 
- **Keep it brief**
  - < 52 characters for H1s
  - < 70 characters for H2s
  - < 35 characters for buttons
  - < 20 to 25 words for sentences
- **Provide information using our Q&A formula**—as though you’re having a conversation with the Veteran on behalf of VA. The Veteran asks us questions in their voice, and we answer in ours. <br> **Example:** <br> How do I apply for VA health care? You can apply online now. If you need help, call us.
- **Add a plain language definition if you need to use a complex term.** The complex terms can come first or you can lead with the plain language description. <br> **Examples:** <br> You'll find your payroll deductions in a recent paycheck. Deductions include money withheld from your pay for things like taxes and benefits.
- **Use bold text in meaningful ways.** Don't overuse it or it'll lose its impact. See the [full style guide entry for how to use bold text effectively](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/bold-text).

## Word list

| Word or phrase | Notes/reasoning |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| **Follow these steps to apply** (header above subway map) | We're trying to avoid directional language like "below" if there's another way to say it. The feedback here was to change the wording and also make that header an H2     |
| **Make sure you're eligible** (No. 1 on subway map) | We are working to standardize the inclusion of this section here and what the header will be--it may change to simply **Check eligibility**, but for now, since this is in progress, let's keep it as **Make sure you're eligible**.|
|                |                 |
|                |                 |
|                |                 |
|                |                 |


## Research findings

Add content-related notes that came out of research that should inform the messaging generally and word choice specifically.

## Other notes

- For applications like this one where you can start the application without being signed in, we want to provide that option in the form of a text link that takes the user straight to the first page of the form. Place it under the button: "Sign in to start your application." See the health care intro page for an example. 
- I requested that BAH update the phone number in the footer under "Need help?" It was the health care number. We'll need to check back to make sure this feedback was incorporated.
- Make sure all these edits were incorporated for the bulleted list (these are Beth's edits and stakeholder edits):
**All of these must be true. You’re:**
•	Between 22 and 66 years old, and
•	Unemployed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and
•	Not eligible for GI Bill or VR&E benefits (or, if you’re eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you’ve transferred all of your benefits to family members), and
•	Not rated as totally disabled because you can’t work, and
•	Not enrolled in a federal or state jobs programs, and
•	Not receiving unemployment benefits (including CARES Act benefits)

## Edits to be incorporated post-MVP

- **Start your education application** button: To standardize buttons and action links across our forms, change to: **Start your application**
- Sitewide content is moving toward standardizing more specific language for the main CTA (blue button), so instead of **Sign in or create an account**, we would like to use **Sign in to start your application**.
- Add **and** after each bullet in the eligibility information.
- Instead of "What if I need help filling out my application?" and the content that follows, we'll do this:
**If you need help filling out your application,** an accredited representative like a Veterans Service Officer (VSO) or a Veteran representative at your school can help you. [Get help filing your claim](https://www.va.gov/disability/get-help-filing-claim/)
