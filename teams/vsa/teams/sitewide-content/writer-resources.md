**Finding a Piece of Drupal Content Fast**\
Click **Edit all** button under **Main Content** which opens all content for editing. Then click anywhere on the page, hit CTRL F, and type in the phrase you're looking for.

**Anchor Links**\
Here's an example that shows how to link to the h2 **A legacy appeal follows these steps** on the legacy appeals page (https://www.va.gov/decision-reviews/legacy-appeals/). 

1. In Drupal, open the page in preview and highlight the h2 you want to link to. Then (on a Mac) press **CTRL** while right clicking. On the menu, click **Inspect**.

2. In the blue highlight, copy the h2 ID. You want everything inside the quotation marks. So, in this example, it's **a-legacy-appeal-follows-these**

3. Put a # in front of it, then insert it at the end of the page url:
