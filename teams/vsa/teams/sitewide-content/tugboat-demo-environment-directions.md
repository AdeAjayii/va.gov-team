This is the presentation the CMS team gave on using Tugboat, the new demo environment. If you do not see the demo environment you want to use, fill out a help request in the CMS support Slack channel.

This can be used for previews you want to share with stakeholders that have them linking among several pages rather than just one preview page. 

This should also be used instead of a regular preview when updating an alert on a page that has previously been published (Drupal will not show updated alert text in preview mode if it's saved as draft).
