This is a weekly sync to coordinate content about sign-in options on VA.gov. 

**June 8, 2023**
-
Attendees: Aliyah, Laura, Sofia, Joe, Carl, and Amber

**Notes**
- We started to review the "Verifying your identity on VA.gov" page. We'll update the page with these changes after we publish the Phase 1 changes (removing mentions of creating a DS Logon account). We'll continue reviewing this page next week. 
  - We'll plan to remove the question "What's the fastest way to verify my identity online?"
  - We'll plan to remove "without a Premium account" from the question "How do I verifiy my identity online?"
  - Joe confirmed info for Login.gov online identity verification - if a user doesn't have a phone number in their name, Login.gov can send a letter to their mailing address instead. We added this info as a "Note" at the end of the bulleted list.
  - Joe confirmed info for ID.me online identity verification - if a user can't upload their driver's license or passport, they can answer questions based on private and public data (like a credit report). We added this info as a "Note" at the end of the bulleted list.
  - We'll plan to adjust "Can I verify my identity in person at a VA facility?" and remove "at a VA facility." We'll also plan to make some adjustment to this question to add information about the USPS in person program. For the USPS program, we'll need to explain that this will only happen after they've failed other verification methods.
  - **Action item:** Joe will confirm if Experian still offers a PIN if a users credit is frozen.
- Carl is working on adjusting email content and he should have a draft ready to share with us next week.

Ad hoc sync with Laura, Aliyah, Joe

**Notes**
- Laura and Aliyah walked through first round of DS Logon-related page updates with Joe for accuracy review.
- Joe confirmed that for both Login.gov and ID.me, VA prompts you to verify the first time you try to access or manage your VA benefits or information, not necessarily the first time you sign in. For some people, it's the first sign-in but not always.
- Joe confirmed that "phone number on a phone plan in your name" is required and this is a key piece of information to keep in our pages.
- Joe confirmed that at this time, changing direct deposit is the only action that requires Login.gov or ID.me accounts, but this may expand in future so we can keep wording as "certain tasks and information."
- Joe flagged that we may need content to address certain groups that can't create Login.gov accounts, including those without state ID and those with non-US addresses. We'll follow up on this in next sync.
- Joe shared that at this time, we can't get direct links to the "create" screens in Login.gov or ID.me flows.
  -  Next step: Joe will add technical documentation for this blocker
  -  Next step: Laura/Aliyah will check back in in 90 days to see if there's movement on this issue

Attendees: Aliyah, Laura, Sofia, Carl, Amber

**Notes**
- Reviewed the Signing in to VA.gov page to make sure it's current. 
- Next step: Adjust "Go to" vs "Visit" link text in last Q&A to be consistent.
- Question: On Creating an account page, different wording in Login and ID sections makes it sound like we prompt to verify at different points in the account creation process — is this accurate? 
  - (Note: We followed up on this in ad hoc with Joe on June 2.)
- Question: On Signing in page, we discuss "confirmation emails" — are these referring to the step in the process where you confirm your email address, or the email we send at the end of the process to confirm that you successfully created an account?
  - Next step: Follow up on this in next sync.
