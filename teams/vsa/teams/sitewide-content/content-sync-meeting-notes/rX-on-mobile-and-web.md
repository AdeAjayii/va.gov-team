**Notes**
- Discussed Medications on MHV to VA.gov Discovery research readout and how it aligns with mobile app research findings. Findings are similar, both have found that we could improve on Rx statuses. 
- Misty will share a readout of recent mobile app Rx research next week. 
- Discussed how notifications work in mobile app. Mobile app has push notifications for upcoming appts and new messages, but not for Rx at this time.
