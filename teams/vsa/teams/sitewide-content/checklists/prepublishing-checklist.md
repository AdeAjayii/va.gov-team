Before publishing any page on VA.gov confirm the following:</br>
- [ ] All links are working and pointing to the intended page
- [ ] Phone numbers are in [aria labels](https://design.va.gov/content-style-guide/dates-and-numbers#phone-numbers)
- [ ] Heirarchy of headings is correct (H1 to H2 to H3--levels shouldn't be skipped)
- [ ] Node IDs are used to create links within Drupal instead of pasting the URL
- [ ] We aren't using sighted language ("view," "see," "look"). These should be replaced with a word that's inclusive of our screen reader users ("check," "go to")
- [ ] If publishing a brand-new page, confirm the left nav and url are set up correctly (if the page is a child page, the section needs to be the same as the parent page in order for the left nav to show)
- [ ] All apostrophes and quotation marks are curly not straight
- [ ] There are no updates in draft by other content authors that aren't ready to be published. Check the revision log and then confirm with the content author who made previous edits that the page is ready to publish

Before publishing a Resources and Support article, make sure these steps are also complete:</br>
- [ ] H2s, H3s, and H4s are within the 70-character limit
- [ ] Related links have been added to the file and make sense for the topic of the page (i.e., they’re actually related to the article—rather than “something you may also be interested in”—and there isn’t an obvious one that’s missing) 
- [ ] Determine if this new article should be added as a related link on any live articles 
- [ ] The wording for the action link (call to action link text) matches other pages that use the same link
- [ ] If linking off of VA.gov, make sure the words in the label or button indicate to the user that they're leaving VA.gov
- [ ] Correct primary article category and additional article categories are selected in the Drupal file
- [ ] Correct benefit hub contacts are selected in the Drupal file
- [ ] Appropriate audience and topic tags are selected in the Drupal file
- [ ] Action links repeat on the bottom of the page if it's a long article
- [ ] **For single Q&A:** Check the standalone button
- [ ] **For multiple FAQs:** First publish each single Q&A and then publish the multiple FAQ
- [ ] **Once published:** Add the article to the R&S landing page. If there are already more than 5 articles in that hub, you do not need to add it unless you want it to replace another article already on the page.
- [ ] **Once published:** If the article is the sixth one in a hub to be published, add the "Go to all articles" link at the bottom of the hub section on the landing page.
- [ ] **Once published:** Add the new article and its action link wording to our [Github file of button labels](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/rs-cta-button-audit.md).
- [ ] **Once published:** Add the new article to our [Github file of R&S articles](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/resources-and-support-article-list.md).
- [ ] **Once published:** Notify the Content Center Support team in their Slack channel (#vsp-contact-center-support) that we've published a new article. Provide the link and a few details about the article. It may be helpful to them for either communicating with Veterans or researching questions themselves.
