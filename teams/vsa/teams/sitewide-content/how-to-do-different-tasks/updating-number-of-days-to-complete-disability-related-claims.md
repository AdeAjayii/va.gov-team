# How to update the number of days to complete disability-related claims on VA.gov pages
Every month, the content team needs to update these 2 pages with a new average for the number of days it takes to complete disability-related claims:
- https://www.va.gov/disability/how-to-file-claim/
- https://www.va.gov/disability/after-you-file-claim/

To do this, on the first day of the month, email Tanekwa Bournes in VBA communications. She will run a report to get the average number of days for the month. The number we need is at the top right corner listed as "Avg. days pending."

One content team member should input this number into the 2 Drupal pages. Be sure to change the month in the text as well. A second content team member should review the changes and publish the page.

Notify Tanekwa once the change is live.
