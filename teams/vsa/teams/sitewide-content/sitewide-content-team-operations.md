# Sitewide Content team operations document

This document serves as a helpful guide for the different tasks Sitewide Content does during the course of a sprint. Some of the work is initiated from other product teams, VA benefit office stakholders, and from the product owners.

## Incoming requests 
### Stakeholder requests
Stakeholders from the different VA benefit offices will reach out via VA email for changes or updates they want made to pages on VA.gov. 
[Review the list of VBA stakeholders](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/VBA%20Stakeholders.md)

Sometimes the stakeholder needs a phone number updated or a link or dollar amount changed on the page. Other times, they are asking to add new information or rework content that's currently on the page. Within a day of the email, a Sitewide Content team member will reply to the stakeholder that we've received the email and will review the information and get back to them with further questions. Sitewide Content should then use the assessment criteria for updating existing pages to determine how best to proceed. <br>

### Product team requests
Product teams will ask Sitewide Content for content support. They may need help writing or editing an alert in their app or creating a brand-new landing page for the tool they'll be launching. They'll open a Sitewide Content and IA intake request form and may come to office hours to discuss what's needed. Sitewide Content should review this request soon after it comes in and determine next steps. We'll use the intake request as the start of an epic and create individual tickets for the content and IA work needed.<br>

## Work Sitewide Content is responsible for
Besides stakeholder requests and product team help, the content team works regularly on a few tasks:
- **Updating different benefit rates annually.** [Read about our process for updating rates pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/how-to-do-different-tasks/how-to-update-rates-pages.md)
- **Updating the number of days to complete disability claims monthly.** [Read how to update the number of days to complete disability0related claims](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/how-to-do-different-tasks/updating-number-of-days-to-complete-disability-related-claims.md)
- **Updating COVID-19 pages (in English, Spanish, and Tagalog) and the COVID-19 chatbot.** [Read about our process for updating COVID-19 pages](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/translation-work/covid-translation-work-process.md)
- **Maintaining the style guide.** Sometimes we find important rules missing from the style guide or we want to clarify or update information that's already there. [Read how to make style guide changes](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/how-to-do-different-tasks/how-to-update-the-style-guide.md)
- **Adding entry points and updating the left nav for new tools and forms added to VA.gov.** When a product team launches a new tool on VA.gov, the Sitewide Content team needs to add the entry points to the Drupal nodes and oftentimes update the left nav and top nav if there's a new static landing page. [Learn how to update the left nav](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/how-to-do-different-tasks/adding-left-nav-and-url.md)
- **Completing audits for specific content or components on VA.gov.** For example, if we need to update certain components for accessibility or we need to update a phone number or link across many pages, we need to audit the site to find every instance. Depending on whether we are auditing only static pages or we also need to include authenticated pages, we should reach out to the CMS team or Public Websites for assistance. [Read about which team to ask for help](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/teams/sitewide-content/how-to-do-different-tasks/public-websites-vs-cms-team-for-help.md)
