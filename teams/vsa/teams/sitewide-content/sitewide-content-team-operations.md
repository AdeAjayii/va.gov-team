# Sitewide Content team operations document

This document serves as a helpful guide for the different tasks Sitewide Content does during the course of a sprint. Some of the work is initiated from other product teams, VA benefit office stakholders, and from the product owners.

## Stakeholder requests
Stakeholders from the different VA benefit offices will reach out via VA email for changes or updates they want made to pages on VA.gov. 
[Review the list of VBA stakeholders](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/products/content/VBA%20Stakeholders.md)

Sometimes the stakeholder needs a phone number updated or a link or dollar amount changed on the page. Other times, they are asking to add new information or rework content that's currently on the page. Within a day of the email, a Sitewide Content team member will reply to the stakeholder that we've received the email and will review the information and get back to them with further questions. Sitewide Content should then use the assessment criteria for updating existing pages to determine how best to proceed. <br>

## Product team requests
Product teams will ask Sitewide Content for content support. They'll open a Sitewide Content and IA intake request form and may come to office hours to discuss what's needed. Sitewide Content should review this request soon after it comes in and determine next steps. We'll use the intake request as the start of an epic and create individual tickets for the contet and IA work needed.<br>
