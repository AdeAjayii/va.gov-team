## Analysis
[Resources and support ratings spreadsheet]
- As a whole, R&S is meeting our goal of 75% or higher "good" ratings, with a 77% "good" average rating.
- Performance isn't as high when broken down to individual pages:
  - 19% of pages are scoring at 90% or higher "good"
  - 35% of pages are meeting our goal of 75% or higher "good," while 49% of pages are scoring 70% or higher
- 28% of pages are scoring at less than 50% "good," with 8% scoring at less than 10% "good" (though 9 of those are based on 1-2 total responses)
- 2 of the top-scoring pages are related to the PACT Act and presumptive conditions (with the presumptive conditions list page getting a 100% "good" score). PACT-related content continues to perform exceptionally well.
- Health care content is generally among the highest-scoring content in both experience ratings (1-5) and "good"/"bad" ratings, with the exception of travel pay reimbursement.
- Most of the lowest-scoring pages revolve around these 3 themes, all of which have known issues beyond content. We should still pull Medallia data on these pages to identify any potential content pain points.
  - Checking your claim status online
  - Travel pay reimbursement
  - Sign in and identity (including privacy and security)
- The helpful phone numbers page is one of our lowest-scoring pages by volume of responses. We need to pull Medallia data and review this page to identify any potential content pain points.
