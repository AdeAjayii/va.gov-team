# Annual content, IA, and accessibility audit for unauthenticated content pages

## Process

- [ ] Notify SMEs 2 weeks in advance of audit start date. Include which sections of the site we'll be asking them about


## Request for SMEs

SMEs to review all identified content for the following:
- Accuracy and timeliness of information
- Any gaps in information
- Any additional SMEs who should review this content
- Any upcoming changes we should anticipate for this content over the next year (based on upcoming legislative, regulation, or programmatic changes)
- Any new programs or products that we should anticipate adding content for, or entry points to, within the next year

## OCTO audit

- Identify content that should move in position (i.e. from benefit hub to R&S). Create tickets in the backlog for implementation of these changes and share a schedule for implementation with SMEs.
- Audit all content pages against the content pre-publication checklist for content design, plain language, and accessibility issues. Create tickets in the backlog for all issues and and share a schedule for implementation with SMEs.
- Run and record grade level checks of each page for documentation. Determine if we need to address grade level.
