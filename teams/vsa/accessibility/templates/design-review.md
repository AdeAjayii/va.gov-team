### Concise issue description
- Where you found it
- More details

#### Bandaid solution
- If helpful, provide a temporary solution that involves less content/design changes

#### Recommended solution
- Try to provide an ideal solution too that explores alternatives should content, design, IA, the broader service, etc can be fixed
- When possible, point to more research with assistive technology users
