## Why are we having this talk

### Compliance confusion

* We have heard folks are confused about how accessibility specialists’ feedback map to required compliance.
* Teams are unsure what issues are “launch blockers” versus what can wait until after a feature is launched, and why.
* We want to make sure everyone understands accessibility language like “508,” “ATO,” “compliance,” “severity levels,” and “WCAG.”
    - Compliance likely means different things to different people.
    - We want to create a common meaning for all VFS teams. 

### There’s some ambiguity… 

* Accessibility is worded differently in every contract.
* There is no boilerplate the VA uses to describe requirements.
* If it’s available to you, it’s worth looking into your contract to see what it says. 
* Each requires meeting Section 508.

### Our work is seen as a “good example”

The VA and the 508 office see our teams as “going above and beyond” and as good examples, which is why we don’t only tell you what you **must** do in reviews. 

We set a standard for others to follow.

### “Accessible”

Accessible doesn’t mean it has to deliver the intended experience and content to assistive technologies. 

It means anyone (with disabilities or not, screen reader or not), should be able to access it. 

This is [Accessibility Beyond Compliance](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/accessibility-beyond-compliance.md).


## Obligated versus what to “reach for”

<blockquote>If everything&rsquo;s !important, 
then nothing is.</blockquote>

### Feedback framework

We have a structure to help understand what is contractually obligated versus what you can “reach for”: the Must/Should/Consider feedback framework.

- **❗️ Must** for if the feedback must be applied 
- **⚠️Should** if the feedback is best practice 
- **✔️ Consider** for suggestions/enhancements 

### Must/Should/Consider started from this feedback framework

HT to Mickin for introducing it! https://medium.com/@jackiebo/do-try-consider-how-we-give-product-feedback-at-asana-db9bc754cc4a

### Combined with WCAG success criteria language

<img src="https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/learning-sessions/abc04-accessibility-compliance/wcag-must-should.png" alt="WCAG success criteria language of Must and Should" />

WCAG 2.0 AA uses:
- Must: Required
- Should: Strongly recommended
- May: Optional or conditionally recommended

### Why Does WCAG use Must and Should?

Key words for use in Request for Comments (RFC) to indicate requirement levels, from Harvard University, provided by Deque: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119

### Accessibility Feedback Framework

 **Must** — required for compliance
**Should** — best practice, industry recommendations, and should be implemented for compliance
**Consider** — suggestions, enhancements, inclusive design, questions/items to consider

### VA Accessibility Defect Severity Rubric

The framework aligns to the severity rubric. Each issue ticket has a label indicating the severity or impact of the issue that links to the rubric level documentation. 
- Must: 508-defect-0, 1, 2
- Should: 508-defect-3
- Consider: 508-defect-4
Find the [rubric in the va.gov-team repo](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/guidance/defect-severity-rubric.md). This appears at the top of each ticket, with the defect rating, linked to its defect description.

### What does it look like in practice?
