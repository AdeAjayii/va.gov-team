# Assistive Tech research FAQs
Tressa Furner, VSA Authenticated Experience

Interview with Trevor Pierce on April 1, 2021

### How does testing with assistive tech work? Do we need a separate research plan?

Assistive tech research is the same as non-assitive tech research - you can use the same plan.  There may be some nuance in language in how you frame the task or question for users. 

### How do we recruit for assistive tech?

Testing for about 5-8 people for assistive tech will work.  Recruiting for inclusive research guidelines can be seen [here.](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/research/inclusive-research-recommendations.md#guidelines-for-inclusive-research-recruiting)

### Should we test mobile or on desktop for assistive tech?

Either one will work. Desktop is easier because users don't need anything besides their computer. Users typically are used to using one or the other, so it might change testing outcomes if a user is using the device that they aren't used to.

For mobile, users **must** attach their phone to a computer, so they have to have the right cord and hardware to do so. Right now we can use zoom with IOS… but we don’t know about Android. Josh or Trevor will have to figure it out before hand if we decide to do a mobile test.  

I will make a document around *how* to share screen in a assistive tech setting when the time comes.

### If we plan a mobile test, but a user ends up testing using desktop - does that negate findings?

This is on a case-by-case basis. Is this someone doing the test on a desktop using mobile screens? Or someone who is doing the test on a desktop using desktop screens?

The most important part is that you document what happened and consider the risks.

### Is there a range of abilities we need to test?

No. Screen readers are the main thing that we’ve recruited for, at this time we’re not adding any other assistive tech.  

### Does a11y need to be on the call or is it something our team could run?

A11y can help with dry runs to make sure any tech hiccups are worked out before the test and then the team can run the whole test. 

### Can we do it in staging? Or does this need to be test in production?

If you are testing with **NO** real user information then it can be done in staging.

If you **ARE** testing with real user information, then it needs to be done in production.
