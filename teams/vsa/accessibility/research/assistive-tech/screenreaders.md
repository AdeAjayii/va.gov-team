- Talkback Android (mobile/tablet)

## Checklist and general recommendations
Screen reader users do not navigate in the same way that sighted users do. Typically, they navigate by keyboard using a combination of mainstream key commands and those specific to their screen reader.

### Preparing for research
- [ ] **Watch the first 25 minutes of this [introduction to screen readers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0m7VEHoXMI&t=61s)** by Deque.
- [ ] **Become familiar with screen reader shortcuts** during your pilot session with an accessibility specialist

### Do during facilitation
- [ ] **Wear headphones** to prevent the user’s screen reader from echoing back to them (this can be very distracting).
- [ ] **Ask how the participant accomplishes tasks.** Screen reader users can navigate from heading to heading, get a list of links organized alphabetically, use the tab key to navigate to links and form controls, and search within the page for keywords, among other methods. It may not be immediately obvious or visible, so it’s ok to ask for clarification.
- [ ] **Send links through email or text** instead of Zoom’s built in chat feature. They will be faster to access than the zoom chat which may be hard to find if it's their first time using it.

### Don't during facilitation
- [ ] **Don’t ask the participant to slow down the speed of their screen reader** (reading rate). It won’t be natural to the participant and can be frustrating to advanced screen reader users who may be used to listening and navigating at a fast pace. If you can’t keep up with the screen reader, **ask them to explain what their screen reader announced post-task** instead.
- [ ] **Don’t rely on visual cues** such as “click here,” or “Look for the blue button.”
- [ ] **Don’t interrupt or talk over the participant** while they complete tasks. Screen reader users need to be able to hear their screen reader in order to complete tasks. Speaking over their screen reader may result in delaying or resetting the task.
