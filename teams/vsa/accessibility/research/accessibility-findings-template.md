# Accessibility Findings
`ZoomText` `JAWs` `iOS-VO` (List types of AT covered here)

## Coverage
This research fufilled X% (y/z) of its original request. Given the limited amount and variety of types of screen readers, no conclusive behavioral patterns can be determined locally in this study alone. However, we can draw future research considerations and document caught accessibility issues.

**Original study request: 6**

> 6 participants should use a screenreader on a desktop or mobile device

**Participants who successfully completed sessions: 3**
