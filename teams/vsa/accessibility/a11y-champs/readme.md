# VSA A11yChamps Program

## Welcome and thanks for your interest! 

The VSA A11yChamps program was created to make sure VSA teams have the support necessary to meet [VSP’s new accessibility requirements for teams](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/platform/accessibility/guidance/staging-review-processes.md) to do their own accessibility testing before requesting staging or full accessibility reviews. By ensuring our products are accessible from day 1, we avoid overloading teams later in the development process. 

It’s also a method for our team members to learn more and ramp up their skills.

Each VSA team will have one “champion” each quarter who stewards accessibility guidance and best practices. They'll help the team get early scanning setup to start designing and building accessibly. The champion is not “responsible” for every aspect of their product being accessible, but can help the team think through considerations and learn.
