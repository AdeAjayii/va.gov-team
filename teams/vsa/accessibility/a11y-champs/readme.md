# Accessibility Champions Community
Welcome to the VA accessibility champions community ‚ú®

We're a grassroots, volunteer led community focused on scaling up VA's accessibility maturity by leveling up our people (like me and you).  

How? By leveling up our people and celebrating their accessibility journey, we envision a VA where...
- _Everyone_ is empowered to make an impact on the disabled Veteran experience
- Teams can conduct most accessibility tasks without the full embedded support of an accessibility specialist
- Less time is spent remediating inaccessible code, and more time is spent centering disabled Veterans in the process
- We all can support one another in a community that values curiosity more than expertise

This was built off a curriculum designed by Jen Strickland and Trevor Pierce, who deserve full credit in establishing the groundwork here ‚ô•Ô∏è 

## You can become an a11y champion üí™ 
  
**At a high level, accessibility champions:**
- steward accessibility beyond compliance and effective practices
- center disabled Veterans, caregivers, and family members (not products, code, or processes)
- aren't experts, but know how to ask for more help

**Depending on their role, they might help their team by:**
- [conducting foundational accessibility reviews for their team](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/prepare-for-an-accessibility-staging-review#Prepareforanaccessibilitystagingreview-Foundationalaccessibilitytests(required)foundational-testing)
- [providing support during research with disabled Veterans](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-assistive-technology-sessions)
- [write accessibility annotations for mockups](https://www.sketch.com/s/aaa5c25f-6991-4aac-a6ed-d378bdff7727/p/C7BD6145-9511-470C-950C-7ACC42DE9F03/canvas)
- answering (or finding answers to) questions in the #accessibility-help channel

**This is a volunteered effort, so rest assured that:**
- you won't be responsible for every aspect of your product being accessible
- you'll have ample support from our accessibility community and accessibility specialists
- you are welcome to step aside at any time (we value our people!)
