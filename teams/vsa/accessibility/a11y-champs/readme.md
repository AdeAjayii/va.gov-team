# Accessibility Champions Community (aka "A11y Champs")
Welcome to the VA accessibility champions community ✨

We're a grassroots, volunteer-led educational program intent on scaling up VA's accessibility maturity through:
- co-design, curiosity, and community 
- centering the diverse voices of disabled Veterans, caretakers, and family members
- asking questions first and learning from others

<strong>[Complete level 1 to start your journey 🪴](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/blob/master/teams/vsa/accessibility/a11y-champs/curriculum/level-1.md)</strong>

## You can become an accessibility champion 💪 
  
**At a high level, accessibility champions:**
- center disabled Veterans, caregivers, and family members (not products, code, or processes)
- aren't experts, but know how to ask for more help and collaborate within a community
- share knowledge with and support their teams as facilitators through relational mentoring

**Depending on their role, they might help their team by:**
- [conducting foundational accessibility reviews for their team](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/collaboration-cycle/prepare-for-an-accessibility-staging-review#Prepareforanaccessibilitystagingreview-Foundationalaccessibilitytests(required)foundational-testing)
- [providing support during research with disabled Veterans](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/research-design/research-assistive-technology-sessions)
- [write accessibility annotations for mockups](https://www.sketch.com/s/aaa5c25f-6991-4aac-a6ed-d378bdff7727/p/C7BD6145-9511-470C-950C-7ACC42DE9F03/canvas)
- answering (or finding answers to) questions in the #accessibility-help channel

**This is a volunteered effort, so rest assured that:**
- you won't be responsible for every aspect of your product being accessible
- you'll have ample support from our accessibility community and accessibility specialists
- you are welcome to step aside at any time (we value our people!)

## What does "a11y" mean?

Glad you asked! The word "accessibility" is often abbreviated to <strong> a11y </strong> — as in, "a", then 11 characters, and then "y". 

Most folks pronounce a11y as "alley" or "a 11 y"
