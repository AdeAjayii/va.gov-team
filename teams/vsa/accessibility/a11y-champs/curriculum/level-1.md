## Accessibility, compliance, and experience
**The word accessibility has many different meanings.** 

Depending on where you've heard it, it might mean...
- a baseline measure of being able to access and contribute to technology 
- a legal government requirement, like Section 508 compliance
- the qualities that make an experience open to all

**To make things simple (for now), let's think about accessibility in terms of compliance vs. experience**

### Compliance encompasses...
- what we think of when we hear "Section 508" or "WCAG 2.0" (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)
- "normative," meaning there are specific, measurable requirements in order to claim "conformance"
- the measurements of a ramp that signify it can be accessed by disabled people
- assessed by a product team or an accessibility specialist

### Experience encompasses...
- the usefulness and understandability of a technology (usability)
- the totality of the effect or effects felt (experienced) internally by a user when interacting with a system, device, or product 
- the awful experience a disabled person may feel when being separated from their friends to access a compliant ramp behind a building and by the dumpsters
- assessed (and felt _internally_) by our disabled Veterans, family members, and caregivers

### We want to focus on accessiblity as an experience more (and as compliance less)
Although it's easier for us to measure accessibility from the frame of compliance, it's not a guarantee that disabled Veterans will still use our products and services. Measuring and understanding the _experience_ of a product can be difficult, but it's much easier when:
- we understand we cannot assess the experience of disabled Veterans for them (we're not experts)
- we center their voices in our work as early and often as possible
- we learn how to ask one another for help

## Learn how to ask for help
**Disability is complex.** No one will have all the answers, not even your specialists!

That's why it's important for us to _just ask_, and why we form communities of practice, not cathedrals of expertise.

The following will help you learn a little bit more about the complexity of disabilities, and hopefully encourage you that it's totally ok to ask questions.

### Pick 2 of the following to read or watch ü§ì

- [ ] [Read chapter 2 of Sheri Byrne-Haber's book, Giving a Damn About Accessibility ](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6071fa745947937fc933ecbb/t/60a02725893d22758a6207c5/1621108519636/Giving-a-damn-about-accessibility.pdf)(page 26-34)
- [ ] [Learn how to say the word "disabilty" (A11y Project)](https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/lets-say-the-word-disability/)
- [ ] [Changing the way we talk about disability, Amy Oulton (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WIP1VgPnco), 14 minutes

- [ ] Ask one question (this can be about anything related to disability or accessibility, for example, "What does a11y stand for?")

## Get started with your first screen reader üó£Ô∏è

Finally, let's get you started on one screen reader ‚ùáÔ∏è
- If you use a Macbook, [watch this video on VoiceOver (youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R-6WvAihms&list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g&index=7)
- If you use a Windows computer, [watch this video on NVDA (youtube) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jao3s_CwdRU&list=PLNYkxOF6rcICWx0C9LVWWVqvHlYJyqw7g&index=9)

### Tasks to complete
- [ ] Turn on your screen reader of choice
  - [ ] If you're using VoiceOver, open up Safari
  - [ ] If you're using NVDA, open up Google Chrome
- [ ] [Go to VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/) 
- [ ] Attempt to navigate...
  - [ ] Line by line
  - [ ] Using headings

#### If you get stuck or can't figure out how to use them

Good! This is supposed to be difficult, and why we have a community üëê
- If you feel a little brave, ask for help on the `#accessibility-help` channel
- If you want a safer space, ask for help on our `#a11y-champs` channel
