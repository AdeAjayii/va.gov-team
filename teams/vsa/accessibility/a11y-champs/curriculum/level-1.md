## Learn how to ask for help
**Disability is complex.** Which means that, when it comes to accessibility, no one will have all the answers (not even your specialists)! 

That's why it's important for us to _just ask_, and why we form communities of practice, not cathedrals of expertise.

The following will help you learn a little bit more about the complexity of disability and accessibility, and hopefully encourage you that it's totally ok to ask questions.
