# Veterans disability statistics

* About 1.52 million (8.5 percent) veterans had a service-connected disability rating of 70 percent or higher.
* About 41 percent of those who served after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other war zones have VA disability ratings, compared to 25 percent of veterans of other eras
* Nearly half (47.7 percent) of all Gulf War II veterans with a disability report a cognitive difficulty. 
* Approximately 300,000 veterans (18.5 percent) who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq are currently suffering from PTSD or major depression.
* About 320,000 (19.5 percent) report experiencing a traumatic brain injury (TBI) during deployment.
* An estimated 31 percent of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have a mental health condition or reported experiencing a TBI.
* As of December 2008, over 30,000 troops have returned from a combat zone with visible wounds and a range of permanent disabilities. An estimated 25-40 percent have less visible wounds—psychological and neurological injuries associated with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or traumatic brain injury (TBI), which have been dubbed “signature injuries” of the Iraq War.

## Post-9/11 Vets Have Far Higher Disability Ratings Than Prior Generations

In 2018, the nation had 19.2 million veterans, less than 8 percent of the total population. 4.1 million of those veterans were from the Gulf War-era II period, covering September 2001 forward, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
In August 2018, 4.7 million veterans, or 25 percent of the total, had a service-connected disability.
Possible reasons:
* Advances in battlefield medicine and rapid evacuations to treatment centers have resulted in more veterans surviving wounds that would have killed them in previous wars.
* There’s a heightened awareness in the military and at the VA of the aftereffects of traumatic brain injury (TBI), along with more screenings for mental health issues resulting from post-traumatic stress. Advances in the ability to diagnose PTSD are another of the many factors in the uptick in disability rates.

## Veterans and vision loss

* More than 158,000 blind or visually impaired veterans now live among us, according to the [Blinded Veterans Association](http://visionaware.org/everyday-living/essential-skills/information-for-veterans-coping-with-vision-loss/blinded-veterans-association-bva/). That’s about 1% of all vets.
* **Each year, some 7,000 veterans become newly blind or visually impaired** as age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy affect their lives more profoundly.
* Some 17 percent of the evacuated wounded service members in Iraq and Afghanistan have suffered a serious eye injury of one type or another.
