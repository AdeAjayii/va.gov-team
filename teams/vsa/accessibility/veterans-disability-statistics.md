# Veterans disability statistics

* About **1.52 million (8.5 percent) veterans had a service-connected disability rating of 70 percent or higher**.

* Of those who served after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other war zones, **about 41 percent have VA disability ratings, compared to 25 percent of veterans of other eras**.

* **Nearly half (47.7 percent) of all Gulf War II veterans with a disability report a cognitive difficulty**. 

* **Approximately 300,000 veterans (18.5 percent) who have returned from Afghanistan and Iraq are currently suffering from PTSD or major depression**.

* **About 320,000 (19.5 percent) report experiencing a traumatic brain injury (TBI) during deployment**.

* An estimated **31 percent of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan have a mental health condition or reported experiencing a TBI**.

* As of December 2008, over 30,000 troops have returned from a combat zone with visible wounds and a range of permanent disabilities. **An estimated 25-40 percent have less visible wounds—psychological and neurological injuries associated with post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or traumatic brain injury (TBI)**, which have been dubbed “signature injuries” of the Iraq War.

## Post-9/11 Vets Have Far Higher Disability Ratings Than Prior Generations

In 2018, the nation had 19.2 million veterans, less than 8 percent of the total population. 4.1 million of those veterans were from the Gulf War-era II period, covering September 2001 forward, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
In August 2018, 4.7 million veterans, or 25 percent of the total, had a service-connected disability.
Possible reasons:
* Advances in battlefield medicine and rapid evacuations to treatment centers have resulted in more veterans surviving wounds that would have killed them in previous wars.
* There’s a heightened awareness in the military and at the VA of the aftereffects of traumatic brain injury (TBI), along with more screenings for mental health issues resulting from post-traumatic stress. Advances in the ability to diagnose PTSD are another of the many factors in the uptick in disability rates.

## Veterans and vision loss

* More than 158,000 blind or visually impaired veterans now live among us, according to the [Blinded Veterans Association](http://visionaware.org/everyday-living/essential-skills/information-for-veterans-coping-with-vision-loss/blinded-veterans-association-bva/). That’s about 1% of all vets.
* **Each year, some 7,000 veterans become newly blind or visually impaired** as age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy affect their lives more profoundly.
* Some 17 percent of the evacuated wounded service members in Iraq and Afghanistan have suffered a serious eye injury of one type or another.

## Lack of access to mental health services contributing to high suicide rates among veterans

* Over 8,000 Veterans will commit suicide each year, that is 22 each day.
* One in 4,000 Veterans without health care benefits commit suicide.
* Veterans’ efforts to gain access to quality psychological health services after multiple deployments are often met with significant obstacles. 
* Lack of access to critical mental health services may lead to suicidal behavior, especially among young military veterans who have completed multiple deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq. 
* Recent data on suicide rates among Army veterans showed an increase of more than 18% from 2011 to 2014. 
* The total number of suicides differs by age group; 31% of these suicides were by veterans 49 and younger, while 69% were by veterans aged 50 and older. Suicide of veterans is primarily male, with about 97 percent of the suicides being male in the states that reported gender.
