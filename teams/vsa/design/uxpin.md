## Why we're using UXPin
- UXPin allows us to share detailed specs with our engineers and collaborators more easily, without extra licenses
- UXPin allows for quicker content copy/pasting
- UXPin has interactive features like form components that are useful when creating form prototypes for testing

**Note: Sketch is still our primary design tool for VSA members**; Sketch design files should be made available for our DEPO partners and future team members

## UXPin process
- Complete designs in Sketch and keep your .sketch files synced in Google Drive with Stream
- Use the [UXPin plugin](https://www.uxpin.com/docs/getting-started/importing-from-sketch/) to sync up your design files for sharing with your team and stakeholders
  - **Note:** The UXPin plugin and import very slowly for large files!  
- If / when you are ready to prototype for testing purposes, you can import your Sketch file directly
  - **Note:** Sketch symbols can import poorly. Before importing, you can break all of your symbols at once using a plugin like [Detach All Symbols.](https://github.com/Pausansol/Detach-all-symbols)

## Notes about collaborating
- Logging onto the web app at the same time will log your partner out, be mindful and coordinate when possible!
- If you and your partner need access to the web app at the same time, ask to use Shawna's credentials
- Use the [UXPin plugin](https://www.uxpin.com/docs/getting-started/importing-from-sketch/) to sync up your designs, similar to the Invision workflow. **Note:** logging into and using the plug in should not affect your partner!
- If you're getting too many emails about other projects, you can update your email preferences in UXPin to just cover your and your partner's project(s)
- If your email is being used for the account, set up mail forwarding from support@uxpin.com to your partner so that they get comment emails
