# Authenticated info list pattern
This pattern helps users quickly see a list of items related to their own personal information, as well as quickly navigate to answers to the questions they might have.

## Desktop Designs

## Mobile Designs

## Usage

### When to use this pattern
This pattern should be used if you're designing an experience where a Veteran is viewing a list of items relevant to them. For example, a list of the claims they have in process, a list of their disability ratings, or a list of the medical devices they have ordered.

### When to consider something else
- If you're designing a list of things embedded in a form, this may not be the best pattern. 
- If you're designing a list with complex filtering and sorting needs, this pattern is probably too simple and you may want to go with patterns more similar to other search tools on our site.

### Behavior

#### The on this page component and headings
The on this page component should start with a link to the list itself, and then list frequently asked questions or other important content topic areas. If there are more than 4 top questions or content topics, you can collapse the questions down to a single H2 "FAQ" in the "on this page component", as seen in the second design mockup with "FAQ about apple trees."

#### Integrating contextual quesions in the cards
Overall questions should be in a content area accessed by the "on this page" component, but more contextual questions can be "addition info" components on the cards themselves

#### Optional card elements 
Not all the elements you see in this design are necessary, for example, if you don't have detail pages for your items, you can leave out the action link and still use this pattern.
