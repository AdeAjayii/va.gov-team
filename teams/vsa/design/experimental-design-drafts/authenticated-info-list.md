# Authenticated info list pattern
This pattern helps users quickly see a list of items related to their own personal information, as well as quickly navigate to answers to the questions they might have.

## Desktop Designs

## Mobile Designs

## Usage

### When to use this pattern
This pattern should be used if you're designing an experience where a Veteran is viewing a list of items relevant to them. For example, a list of the claims they have in process, a list of their disability ratings, or a list of the medical devices they have ordered.

### When to consider something else
If you're designing a list of things embedded in a form, this may not be the best pattern. 

### Behavior

#### The on this page component
The on this page component should start with a link to the list itself, and then list frequently asked questions. If there are more than 4 top questions, you can collapse the questions down to a single "FAQ" header in "on this page", as seen in the second design mockup.
