# Authenticated info list pattern
This pattern helps users quickly see a list of items related to their own personal information, as well as quickly navigate to answers to the questions they might have.

## Desktop Designs

## Mobile Designs

## Usage

### When to use this pattern
This pattern should be used if you're designing an experience where a Veteran is viewing a list of items relevant to them. For example, a list of the claims they have in process, a list of their disability ratings, or a list of the medical devices they have ordered.

### When to consider something else
- If you're designing a list of things embedded in a form, this may not be the best pattern. 

### Behavior

#### The on this page component and headings
The on this page component should start with a link to the list itself, and then list frequently asked questions. If there are more than 4 top questions, you can collapse the questions down to a single "FAQ" header in "on this page", as seen in the second design mockup.

#### Integrating contextual quesions in the cards 

#### Optional card elements 
Not all the elements you see in this design are necessary, for example, if you don't have detail pages for your items, you can leave out the action link and still use this pattern.
