There is a 1:many relationship between products and initiatives. The same goes for product outlines and initiative briefs; a product outline has multiple initiative briefs, which describe iterations.* 

## Outcome Summary

Include the measurable outcome (i.e. metric) you're trying to improve.*

## Problem Statement

* What is the problem?
* Which Veteran/organizational segments are most affected by the problem?
