# QUESTION BANK

#### 12. What should I do if I have an upcoming VA health appointment?

##### For scheduled procedures

**If you have a non-urgent elective procedure scheduled,** we may contact you to cancel or reschedule for a later date. Urgent and emergent procedues will continue as scheduled.

##### For routine scheduled appointments

We recommend using telehealth to visit your provider by phone or video. You can also cancel or reschedule your appointment.

**To change your appointment to a telehealth visit, sign in online to:**
- [Send a secure message](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/secure-messaging-spotlight) to your provider through My HealtheVet, **or**
- [Request a telehealth appointment online]((https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/) for some types of appointments

Once your provider schedules a telehealth appointment, you’ll receive a link to VA Video Connect (or another approved video meeting tool). 

_COMMENTS ON THIS SECTION:_
1. I'm checking on the telehealth appointment online tool because the actual tool page has a note saying we don't want routine appointment requests right now due to high volume with covid.

#### 17. Can I be tested for coronavirus COVID-19 at VA?

**This depends on many factors, including your:**
- Symptoms and their severity
- Other existing illnesses or conditions
- Possible exposure

We're currently testing Veterans who meet the CDC's criteria. 

#### 18. What should I do if I have a community care appointment?

Please contact your community care (non-VA) provider directly before going to your appointment. Some providers' hours or services may be affected by current CDC and local health department guidelines. 

##### If your community care provider cancels your appointment

Work with the provider to reschedule. We're extending VA authorizations for community care referrals during this time.

If you have concerns about rescheduling your appointment, [send a secure message](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/secure-messaging-spotlight) to your VA provider.

#### 19. What is VA doing to deal with COVID-19?

We've activated our emergency management coordination cell (EMCC) and started clinical screenings at all VA facilities.<br>
[Learn more about our public health response](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/n-coronavirus/)

#### 20. How do I reschedule or cancel my upcoming VA appointment? 

Sign in to your VA.gov account to [reschedule or cancel your appointment online](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/).

**Note:** Some clinics are asking patients to not reschedule or schedule new appointments for some types of routine care so they can protect both patients and staff. The situation is changing quickly. For the latest information, please check your local VA health facility’s website. <br>
[Find a VA location](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/) 

#### 21. Can I get a referral to see a community care provider if I can't be seen at VA?

This depends on your needs. We’re continuing to make community care referrals. But we’re prioritizing referrals for urgent or other medically necessary care. And some community care providers' hours or services may be affected CDC and local health department guidelines.

**Please remember:** You need VA approval for all community care appointments, except for emergency and urgent care needs. Getting a referral depends on eligibility, type of care, and other factors. At this time, community care eligibility requirements haven't changed. <br>
[Learn about eligibility for community care](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/veterans/index.asp)

#### 22. What if I tried to call my clinic and I can't get through?

We apologize if you can't get through or are on hold for a long time. We’re currently receiving a very high number of calls, and we're working hard to handle the increase. 

**To help us address the most urgent needs first, we ask that you use one of our online tools for routine or non-urgent concerns. You can:**

- [Send a secure message to your VA provider](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) about any health concern or question.
- [Try our health chat app (limited availability)](https://www.mobile.va.gov/app/va-health-chat) if your primary VA health facility is part of the pilot.

#### 23. What should I do if I need to refill my prescription?

First, please request refills as soon as possible. We'll process your request and send your refill before you're scheduled to run out of your current prescription.

##### If you currently get your prescription sent to you by mail
You’ll continue to receive your refills as normal. 

#### If you usually pick up your prescription in person or online

**You must actively request a refill in one of these ways:** 
- **Online** with the [My HealtheVet prescription refill and tracking tool](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home).
- **Through our new [RX Refill mobile app](https://www.mobile.va.gov/app/rx-refill)**. 
- **By phone.** Call the number on your prescription label for your VA pharmacy's automated refill line. Be sure to have your RX number from the prescription label and Social Security number ready. For many prescriptions that are no longer refillable, you can request to have more medication sent to you. For some medications, your health care team may contact you first.
- **By mail.** Complete the prescription refill form that came with each medication. Mail the form to the VA pharmacy address listed on your medication paperwork.

##### If you have questions about your prescriptions
If you need a prescription renewed that's no longer refillable, or if you have other questions, send a [secure message to your provider](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) through My HealtheVet or call your local VA medical center. 

#### 24. Can I use emergency care?

##### If you have life-threatening medical emergency

Call 911 or go to your nearest ER. For emergencies, you don’t need a referral or approval from VA to go to a non-VA ER in your community.

**Symtoms that may require emergency care include:**
- Chest pain
- Numbness or tingling in your arms or on one side of your body
- Severe fever or violent vomiting
- Bleeding that doesn’t stop

##### If you have an urgent care need

**Please contact us first.** You can send a [secure message to your provider](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) or call your facility’s advice nurse before going to a clinic or walk-in urgent care facility. By not using the ER for nonmedical emergencies, you can help us protect you, other patients, and our staff. And you can help us address critical medical needs first during this period of COVID-19 outbreak. 

**Symptoms that may require urgent care (within 24 to 48 hours) include:**
- Sore throat, earache
- Sprains or strained muscles from sports or exercise
- Minor cuts and injuries

#### 25. How do I know if my VA health facility is still open for regular appointments? 

The situation is changing quickly during this time. To get the latest information, please check your local VA health facility’s website. <br>
[Find a VA location](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/)

#### 26. I don't have symptoms, but I feel anxious and overwhelmed. What can I do? 

First, know that you're not alone, and we can help. 

Many people feel stress about COVID-19. These steps may help:

- **Stay connected and healthy.** Stay in touch with friends and family by phone and social media. Follow your normal routine as much as possible, and get enough sleep and exercise. 
- **Keep your existing mental health appointments.** If you currently have regular sessions, [send your provider a secure message](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) to request telehealth visits by phone or video.
- **Ask for a new mental health appointment.** If you need same-day mental health care—or want to request a new appointment—call your local VA health facility.<br>

#### 27. How can I ask for a new mental health appointment?

If you need same-day mental health care—or want to request a new appointment—call your local VA health facility.<br>
**[Find a VA location](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)**

#### 28. Can I visit a patient at a VA facility?

##### For VA nursing homes, and spinal cord and disorder centers

At this time, you can't visit a resident in a VA nursing home or spinal cord injury and disorder center, unless they qualify as a "compassionate case." This means the Veteran is in their last stage of life in a hospice unit and you can visit that Veteran’s room only. 

We understand this is difficult for families, but we're doing it to protect the most vulnerable patients from community spread of the coronavirus COVID-19. Learn about the [steps we’re taking to protect Veterans in nursing homes](https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5400).

##### For other VA health facilities

At this time, we ask that you postpone your visit. This helps us protect older Veterans and those who already have health issues. [Visit the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) for more tips on stopping community spread.

#### 29. Will my benefit payment be delayed because of COVID-19?

No. We’re currently processing all benefit payments as normal. This includes:
- Disability payments
- Pension payments
- Education payments to your school
- And more  

[View your VA benefit payments online](https://www.va.gov/va-payment-history/)

#### 30. My school changed all classes to online. Will I still qualify for my GI bill benefits? 

Yes. If you’re currently receiving GI Bill benefits, payments will continue automatically. You don’t have to do anything. 

We’re working closely with schools to ensure enrollments are accurately certified and processed.

For specific questions, contact the Education Call Center toll-free at 888-442-4551, Mon. – Fri., 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET.

#### 31. Are VA regional offices closed? 

Yes. We’ve temporarily closed all of our 56 regional offices for in-person visits. This decision is based on current CDC guidelines to prevent community spread of the coronavirus COVID-19. 

We can still support you with educational counseling, claims information, and other services by phone or approved video conferencing tools.
