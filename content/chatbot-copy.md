## 2. Welcome and emergency warning symptoms

[Good morning/Good afternoon/Good evening], [NAME].

I'm here as VA's virtual assistant to help answer your questions about the coronavirus COVID-19 and VA benefits and services. If I can't answer all your questions, I'll help you connect to a call center representative.

**If you or someone else has any of these emergency warning signs of COVID-19, please call 911 to get medical care right away:**
- Trouble breathing
- Persistent (continuing) pain or pressure in the chest
- Bluish lips or face
- New confusion (suddenly feeling confused)
- Inability to arouse (trouble waking up or staying awake)

_COMMENTS FOR THIS SCREEN:_ 
1. Incorporated Ramya's research around personalized/time-sensitive greeting, if possible. I did a little reading around whether or not to "name" the chatbot. An [interesting article](https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/07/on-bots-language-and-making-technology-disappear/) noted that it can be annoying and disruptive to users, and I think that may be true specifically in this kind of situation where we're dealing with very serious, critical info. So I'm thinking maybe just, "I'm here as VA's virtual assistant..." or even more simply, "I'm here to answer your questions..." Thoughts?
2. One question I have around timing-based greeting: Will the bot be able to know the user's time zone?
3. Ramya's research noted that the intro should include how the user will interact with the bot. As part of that, I think it would be good to offer the reassurance that the user can connect to a person if this doesn't work right up front. Thoughts?
4. Do we need to add other info about how the user will interact with the bot, like how they'll choose topics and questions? My instinct is no, it will be self-explanatory in the experience, but would love others' thoughts.

_COMMENTS ON THIS SECTION_
1. Is it accurate to say you can always "come back to this list" or will the list be always present or in a menu? Just want to make sure content reflects design and functionality.
2. I've made the topic names more gramatically parallel. Also made "Getting care at VA" topic more general since it covers community (non-VA) care, prescriptions, etc.

### 13 - 16. What question can I answer for you first?

Please choose the question that best fits your needs. You can always come back to this list to choose a new question. <br>

_COMMENTS ON THIS SECTION_
1. Thoughts on whether to include "first" (ie, "What question can I answer for you first?") to imply that the user is welcome to ask as many questions as they like?
2. Same question as in above section on "come back" language.
3. We may not even need the "Please choose" language here. It may just be obvious with the design.

# QUESTION BANK

#### 12. What should I do if I have an upcoming VA health appointment?

##### For scheduled procedures

If you have a non-urgent elective procedure scheduled, we may contact you to cancel or reschedule for a later date. Urgent and emergent procedues will continue as scheduled.

##### For routine scheduled appointments

We recommend using telehealth to visit your provider by phone or video. 

**To change your appointment to a telehealth visit, sign in online to:**
- [Send a secure message](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/secure-messaging-spotlight) to your provider through My HealtheVet, **or**
- [Request a telehealth appointment online]((https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/) for some types of appointments

Once your provider schedules a telehealth appointment, you’ll receive a link to VA Video Connect (or another approved video meeting tool). 

You can also [cancel or reschedule your appointment](link to 20. How do I reschedule or cancel my upcoming VA appointment?). 

_COMMENTS ON THIS SECTION:_
1. I'm checking on the telehealth appointment online tool because the actual tool page has a note saying we don't want routine appointment requests right now due to high volume with covid.
2. We encourage changing to telehealth here, and we give instructions around that (following the FAQs page and call center approaches). But we also note that you can cancel or reschedule, and those instructions are in another question. Hoping we can include a link to surface that related question (20. How do I reschedule or cancel my upcoming VA appointment?).

#### 17. Can I be tested for coronavirus COVID-19 at VA?

**This depends on many factors, including your:**
- Symptoms and their severity
- Other existing illnesses or conditions
- Possible exposure

Our health facilities have been testing Veterans who meet the CDC's criteria. We don't charge a fee for testing.

#### 18. What should I do if I have a community care appointment?

Please contact your community care (non-VA) provider directly before going to your appointment. Some providers' hours or services may be affected by current CDC and local health department guidelines. 

##### If your community care provider cancels your appointment

Work with the provider to reschedule. We're extending VA authorizations for community care referrals so you can continue to work with your provider to meet your needs during this time.

If you have concerns about rescheduling your appointment, [send a secure message](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/secure-messaging-spotlight) to your VA provider.

#### 19. What is VA doing to deal with COVID-19?

We've activated our emergency management coordination cell (EMCC) and started clinical screenings at all VA facilities. <br>

[Learn more about our public health response](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/n-coronavirus/)

#### 20. How do I reschedule or cancel my upcoming VA appointment? 

Sign in to your VA.gov account to [reschedule or cancel your appointment online](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/).

**Note:** Some clinics are advising patients to not reschedule or schedule new appointments for some types of routine care, as they develop more guidance on safely providing care to protect patients and staff. Because this is a rapidly changing situation, the best way to get the most up-to-date facility information is to check your local VA health facility’s website. <br>
[Find a VA location](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/) 

#### 21. Can I get a referral to see a community care provider if I can't be seen at VA?

This may depend on your needs. We’re continuing to make community care referrals when needed. But we’re prioritizing referrals for urgent or other medically necessary care. And some community care providers' hours or services may be affected CDC and local health department guidelines.

**Please remember:** You need VA approval for all community care appointments, except for emergency and urgent care needs. Getting a referral depends on eligibility, type of care, and other factors. At this time, community care eligibility requirements haven't changed. <br>
[Learn about eligibility for community care](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/veterans/index.asp)

#### 22. What if I tried to call my clinic and I can't get through?

We apologize if you can't get through or are on hold for a long time. We’re currently receiving a very high number of calls, and our staff is working hard to handle the increase. 

To help us address the most urgent needs first, we ask that you use one of our online tools for routine or non-urgent concerns. You can:

- **Use Secure Messaging.** You can send a [secure message to your provider](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) about any health concern or question.
- **Try health chat (limited availability).** You may be able to use our health chat if your primary VA health facility is part of the VA health chat pilot. <br>
[Find out if you're able to use health chat ](https://www.mobile.va.gov/app/va-health-chat)

#### 23. What should I do if I need to refill or renew my prescription?

To make sure you have your medicine in time, request your refill or renewal at least 10 days before you’ll run out of your current prescription.

##### If you currently get your prescription sent to you by mail
You’ll continue to receive your refills as normal. 

#### If you usually pick up your prescription in person
Use one of these other ways to get your medicine refilled or renewed. 
- **Online.** Use our [online prescription refill and tracking tool](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) to refill or renew your prescription.
- **By phone.** Call the number on your prescription label for your VA pharmacy. Be sure to have your RX number from the prescription label and Social Security number ready. For many prescriptions that are no longer refillable, this automated phone line may allow you to send a request to have more medication sent to you. For some medications, your health care team may contact you first.
- **By mail.** Complete the prescription refill form for each medication, and mail it to your VA pharmacy. You'll find the pharmacy address on the paperwork that came with your prescription.

##### If you have questions about your prescriptions
Send a [secure message to your provider](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) through My HealtheVet or call your local VA medical center. 

#### 24. Can I use emergency care?

##### If you have life-threatening medical emergency

Call 911 or go to your nearest ER. For emergencies, you don’t need a referral or approval from VA to go to a non-VA ER in your community.

**Symtoms that may require emergency care include:**
- Chest pain
- Numbness or tingling in your arms or on one side of your body
- Severe fever or violent vomiting
- Bleeding that doesn’t stop

##### If you have an urgent care need

Please contact us first. You can use secure messaging or call your facility’s advice nurse before going to a clinic or walk-in urgent care facility.

**Symptoms that may require urgent care (within 24 to 48 hours) include:**
- Sore throat, earache
- Sprains or strained muscles from sports or exercise
- Minor cuts and injuries

#### 25. How do I know if my VA health facility is still open for regular appointments?

#### 26. I don't have symptoms, but I feel anxious and overwhelmed. What can I do? 

First, it's important to know you're not alone, and we're here for you. Concerns about COVID-19 can be stressful for many people. You can take steps to manage stress and get support.

- **Stay connected and healthy.** Stay in touch with friends and family by phone and social media. Follow your normal routine as much as possible, and get enough sleep and exercise. 
- **Keep your existing mental health appointments.** If you currently have regular sessions, you can change them to telehealth (phone or video) appointments by [sending your provider a secure message](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) through My HealtheVet.
- **Ask for a new mental health appointment.** If you need same-day mental health care—or want to request a new appointment—call your local VA health facility.<br>
