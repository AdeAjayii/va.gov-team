# QUESTION BANK

#### 8. What should I do if I have an upcoming VA health appointment?

##### For scheduled procedures

**If you have a non-urgent elective procedure scheduled,** we may contact you to cancel or reschedule for a later date. Urgent and emergency procedures will continue as scheduled.

##### For routine scheduled appointments

We recommend using telehealth to visit your provider by phone or video. You can also cancel or reschedule your appointment.

**To change your appointment to a telehealth visit, sign in to:**
- [Send a secure message](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/secure-messaging-spotlight) to your provider through My HealtheVet, **or**
- [Request to change to a telehealth appointment online]((https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/) for some types of appointments

Once your provider schedules a telehealth appointment, you’ll receive a link to VA Video Connect (or another approved video meeting tool). 

#### 13. What is VA doing to deal with COVID-19?

We've activated our emergency management coordination cell (EMCC) and started clinical screenings at all VA facilities.<br>
[Learn more about our public health response](https://www.publichealth.va.gov/n-coronavirus/)

#### 14. How do I reschedule or cancel my upcoming VA appointment? 

Sign in to your VA.gov account to [reschedule or cancel your appointment online](https://www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/).

**Note:** Some clinics are asking patients to not reschedule or schedule new appointments for some types of routine care so they can protect both patients and staff. The situation is changing quickly. For the latest information, please check your local VA health facility’s website. <br>
[Find a VA location](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/) 

#### 15. Can I get a referral to see a community care provider if I can't be seen at VA?

This depends on your needs. We’re continuing to make community care referrals. But we’re prioritizing referrals for urgent or other medically necessary care. And some community care providers' hours or services may be affected by CDC and local health department guidelines.

**Please remember:** You need VA approval for all community care appointments, except for emergency and urgent care needs. Getting a referral depends on eligibility, type of care, and other factors. At this time, community care eligibility requirements haven't changed. <br>
[Learn about eligibility for community care](https://www.va.gov/COMMUNITYCARE/programs/veterans/index.asp)

#### 16. What if I tried to call my clinic and I can't get through?

We apologize if you can't get through or are on hold for a long time. We’re currently receiving a very high number of calls, and we're working hard to handle the increase. 

**To help us address the most urgent needs first, we ask that you use one of our online tools for routine or non-urgent questions. You can:**

- **[Send a secure message to your VA provider](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home)** about any health concern or question.
- **[Enroll in the Annie app COVID-19 service](https://www.mobile.va.gov/app/annie-app-veterans)** for daily text messages to check on how you’re feeling and let you know when you should contact your care team.
- **[Try our new health chat app (limited availability)](https://www.mobile.va.gov/app/va-health-chat)** if your primary VA health facility is one of the [select locations](https://www.mobile.va.gov/app/va-health-chat) testing this new feature.

#### 17. What should I do if I need to refill my prescription?

Please request refills as soon as possible, but no later than 10 days before you run out of your current prescription.

**Note:** If you currently get your prescription sent to you by mail, you’ll continue to receive your refill requests as normal. 

##### To request a refill

**You'll need to actively request your refill in one of these ways:** 
- **Online** with the [My HealtheVet prescription refill and tracking tool](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home).
- **Through your mobile device** with our new [RX Refill mobile app](https://www.mobile.va.gov/app/rx-refill)**. 
- **By phone.** Call the number on your prescription label for your VA pharmacy's automated refill line or to speak to a pharmacy representative. Be sure to have your RX number from the prescription label and Social Security number ready. 
- **By mail.** Complete the prescription refill form that came with your medication. Mail the form to the VA pharmacy address listed on your medication paperwork.

For questions about your prescriptions, send a [secure message to your provider](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) through My HealtheVet or call your local VA medical center.

##### If you've run out of refills on your prescription

**You can request a prescription renewal in one of these ways:**
- Call the number on your prescription label. Be sure to have your RX number from the prescription label and Social Security number ready. For some medications, your health care team may need to contact you before you can get more medication.
- Send a [secure message to your provider](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) through My HealtheVet. 
- Call your local VA medical center. <br> 
[Find a VA location](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/)

##### If your prescription renewal requires an in-person evaluation

If you need to renew a prescription for a medication that requires an in-person evaluation, we've temporarily updated our policy to allow this type of evaluation through telehealth (phone or video) appointment. 

To request a telehealth appointment for a prescription renewal, send a [secure message to your provider](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) through My HealtheVet.

#### 17. What should I do if I have a community care appointment?

Please contact your community care (non-VA) provider directly before going to your appointment. Some providers' hours or services may be affected by current CDC and local health department guidelines. 

##### If your community care provider cancels your appointment

Work with the provider to reschedule. We're extending VA authorizations for community care referrals during this time.

If you have concerns about rescheduling your appointment, [send a secure message](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/web/myhealthevet/secure-messaging-spotlight) to your VA provider.

#### 18. Can I use emergency care?

##### If you have a life-threatening medical emergency

Call 911 or go to your nearest ER. For emergencies, you don’t need a referral or approval from VA to go to a non-VA ER in your community.

**Symptoms that may require emergency care include:**
- Chest pain
- Numbness or tingling in your arms or on one side of your body
- Severe fever or violent vomiting
- Bleeding that doesn’t stop

##### If you have an urgent care need

**Please contact us first.** You can send a [secure message to your provider](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) or call your facility’s advice nurse before going to a clinic or walk-in urgent care facility. <br>
[Find a VA location](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/)

Please don't go to the ER for nonmedical emergencies. This helps us protect you, other patients, and our staff from community spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 and address critical medical needs first during this time. 

**Symptoms that may require urgent care (within 24 to 48 hours) include:**
- Sore throat, earache
- Sprains or strained muscles from sports or exercise
- Minor cuts and injuries

#### 19. How do I know if my VA health facility is still open for regular appointments? 

The situation is changing quickly during this time. To get the latest information, please check your local VA health facility’s website. <br>
[Find a VA location](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/)

#### 20. I don't have symptoms, but I feel anxious and overwhelmed. What can I do? 

First, know that you're not alone, and we can help. 

Many people feel stress about COVID-19. These steps may help:

- **Stay connected and healthy.** Stay in touch with friends and family by phone and social media. Follow your normal routine as much as possible, and get enough sleep and exercise. 
- **Keep your existing mental health appointments.** If you currently have regular sessions, [send your provider a secure message](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) to request telehealth visits by phone or video.
- **Ask for a new mental health appointment.** If you need same-day mental health care—or want to request a new appointment—call your local VA health facility.<br>
**[Find a VA location](https://www.va.gov/find-locations)**

#### 21. How can I ask for a new mental health appointment?

**If you’re already using VA medical services**

[Learn more about getting started with VA mental health care](https://www.va.gov/health-care/health-needs-conditions/mental-health/)

#### 22. Can I visit a patient at a VA facility?

##### For VA nursing homes, and spinal cord and disorder centers

At this time, you can't visit a resident in a VA nursing home or spinal cord injury and disorder center, unless they qualify as a "compassionate case." This means the Veteran is in their last stage of life in a hospice unit and you can only visit that Veteran’s room. 

We know this is difficult for families, but we're taking these precautions to protect the most vulnerable patients from community spread of the coronavirus COVID-19. Learn about the [steps we’re taking to protect Veterans in nursing homes](https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id=5400).

##### For other VA health facilities

At this time, we ask that you postpone your visit. This helps us protect older Veterans and those who already have health issues. <br>

[Visit the CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) for more tips on stopping community spread.

#### 23. Will my benefit payment be delayed because of COVID-19?

No. We’re currently processing all benefit payments as normal. This includes:
- Disability payments
- Pension payments
- Education payments to your school
- And more  

[View your VA benefit payments online](https://www.va.gov/va-payment-history/)

#### 24. My school changed all classes to online. Will I still qualify for my GI bill benefits? 

Yes. If you’re currently receiving GI Bill benefits, payments will continue automatically. You don’t have to do anything. 

We’re working closely with schools to ensure enrollments are accurately certified and processed.

For specific questions, contact our Education Call Center toll-free at 888-442-4551, Mon. – Fri., 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET. If you have hearing loss, call TTY 711.

#### 25. Are VA regional offices closed? 

Yes. We’ve temporarily closed all of our 56 regional offices for in-person visits. This decision is based on current CDC guidelines to prevent community spread of the coronavirus COVID-19. 

We can still answer your questions by phone or through our online customer service tool. And we can support you with needs such as educational counseling, fiduciary claims, and specially adaptive housing by phone or approved video conferencing tools. 

**To get help with benefits,** call us at 800-827-1000, Mon. – Fri., 8:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. ET. If you have hearing loss, call TTY 800-829-4833.

Or send a question to our online customer service tool called [IRIS (Inquiry Routing & Information System)](https://iris.custhelp.va.gov/). 

#### 34. If I need to leave my house, how do I stay safe? 

If you need to go out to get essential items like groceries and medicines, the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. 

**Follow these 5 steps to help protect yourself and others—even if you're feeling well:**

**1. Stay at least 6 feet away from others** (called physical distancing).
**2. Wear a cloth face cover.** Don't wear a mask that's meant for a healthcare worker. And don't put a face cover on children under 2 or anyone who can't remove the cover themselves.
**3. Avoid anyone who appears sick.**
**4. Try to wipe down frequently touched items,** like door or shopping cart handles. 
**5. Wash your hands with soap and water or use hand sanitizer** after you touch items in a store. Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. 

#### 35. What steps can I take to protect myself and others? 

There's a lot you can do to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. 

**Take these 6 steps, even if you're feeling well:**

1. **Stay home** except to get medical care or essential items like groceries and medicines.
2. **Stay at least 6 feet away from others** if you do need to go out (called physical distancing).
3. **Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds,** especially after you go out in public or after you blow your nose, cough, or sneeze. If you don't have soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. 
4. **Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth** with unwashed hands.
5. **Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover** when you're out in public. Don't use a mask meant for a health care worker.
6. **Clean and disinfect all "high-touch" surfaces each day.** This includes things like light switches, counters, and door knobs.

**If you're sick, take these 5 added steps:**

1. **Monitor your symptoms and stay in contact with your health care team by phone or video.** Take care of both your physical and emotional wellbeing.
2. **If you need to get medical care in person, please contact us first.** Send a [secure message to your provider](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/mhv-portal-web/user-login?redirect=/mhv-portal-web/home) or call your facility’s advice nurse. This will decrease exposure risk to you and to others. 
[Find a VA location](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/)
3. **Stay in a separate room, away from other people and animals in your home,** with the exception of a service animal. If possible, use a separate bathroom.
4. **Wear a cloth face covering** if you do need to be in the same room with others.
5. **Avoid sharing personal items** like dishes, towels, and bedding.

[Get more tips from CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/checklist-household-ready.html)

#### 36. Should I wear a mask?

Yes. You should cover your nose and mouth with a cloth face cover when you're in public. You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you don't feel sick.

CDC recommends that almost everyone wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, like to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities. Be sure not to put a mask on a child under age 2 or on anyone who has trouble breathing or can't remove the mask without help.

**Remember:** Don't wear a mask that's meant for a health care worker. And don't forget to stay at least 6 feet away from others. Masks aren't a substitute for physical distancing.

#### 37. When will a vaccine be out?

An announcement was made by the NIH (National Institute of Health) on March 16, 2020 about an investigational vaccine. The first dose was given that day. 

We can't know how long it will take to develop a safe, effective vaccine. At this time, it's very difficult to predict the specific time a vaccine will be available.

#### 38. If I get COVID-19, will I have immunity from getting it again?

We don’t yet know. Based on experiences with past viruses, exposure will likely lead to a level of immunity. But we'll need time to see if that holds true for COVID-19. 

#### 40. Will my COVID-19 stimulus check lower my VA payments?

No. We won’t count any money received as part of the COVID-19 stimulus package as income for VA pension or parent Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) beneficiaries. This means your payments will stay the same.

#### 41. What if I can't pay my existing VA debt?

As of April 3, 2020, we’ve taken action to stop collection on newly established Veteran debt and make it easier for Veterans to request extended repayment plans and address other needs during this time. Please check back regularly for updates.

**If you have VA debt that we’ve already transferred to the U.S. Department of the Treasury **

The U.S. Department of the Treasury won’t take any more action on your debt during this time. This means they won’t add more fees or interest, reduce or withhold part of your federal or state payments or job wages to pay your debt, or refer your account to a private collection agency.

**If you have VA debt being managed by VA**

We’ll work with you to decide whether you’d prefer us to temporarily stop collection action, including stopping the addition of fees and interest, during this time or extend your repayment terms.

- **If you have debt related to VA benefits,** please contact the VA Debt Management Center at 800-827-0648 to make arrangements. We’re here Monday through Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. ET.
- **If you have debt related to VA health care,** please contact the Health Resource Center at 888-827-4817 to make arrangements. Be sure to have your account number ready.

#### 42. What if I'm having trouble paying my VA-backed home loan during this time?

If you’re experiencing financial hardship directly or indirectly caused by COVID-19, you can request forbearance from your mortgage company. This allows you to delay payments on your loan for a period of time. 

To request forbearance, contact the mortgage company that collects your payments. <br>

[Learn more about how we can help you avoid foreclosure](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/trouble-making-payments/)

#### 43. Will I still have to pay my VA copays during the pandemic?

As of April 6, 2020, we’ve stopped sending monthly copay billing statements for all Veterans. This means you won’t receive a bill for any copays during this time. Please check back regularly for updates.

#### 44. What if I've been diagnosed with COVID-19 and need immediate action on my VA appeal?

The Board of Veterans' Appeals will offer you a priority review to move your appeal to the front of the line. This is called “Advanced on the Board of Veterans’ Appeals Docket” (or AOD). <br>

[Find out how to file for AOD and required documents](https://www.bva.va.gov/CustomerService.asp) <br>

[Check your VA claim or appeal status online](https://www.va.gov/claim-or-appeal-status/)

#### 45. How do I get help if I'm homeless or at risk of becoming homeless?

We offer many programs and services that may help—including free health care and, in some cases, free limited dental care. We can also help you connect with resources in your community, like homeless shelters or faith-based organizations.

**Find the support you need:**

- **Call the National Call Center for Homeless Veterans** at 877-424-3838 for help 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You’ll talk privately with a trained VA counselor for free.
- **Contact your nearest VA medical center** and ask to talk with a VA social worker. If you're a female Veteran, ask for the Women Veterans Program Manager.
