##### For scheduled procedures

If you have a non-urgent elective procedure scheduled, we may contact you to cancel or reschedule for a later date. Urgent and emergent procedues will continue as scheduled.

We recommend using telehealth to visit your provider by phone or video.

**To change your appointment to a telehealth visit, sign in online to:**

- [Request a telehealth appointment online]((https:/*www.va.gov/health-care/schedule-view-va-appointments/) for some types of appointments

Once your provider schedules a telehealth appointment, you’ll receive a link to VA Video Connect (or another approved video meeting tool).
