# Goal of user testing

To find out whether users prefer a bot that presents itself as a helpful personal assistant for the Veteran, or one that VA presents as a tool the Veteran can use. I'm particularly interested in understanding if the more personal nature of the first person bot feels warm and inviting, or whether it feels annoying and offputting, particularly given that it's coming from a government organization people may have complex feelings about and the critical and serious nature of the topic.

## Version 1: First person bot (ie, the bot is speaking as an "individual" with a personal tone)

### Intro

[Good morning/Good afternoon/Good evening], [NAME].

I'm here as VA's virtual assistant to help answer your questions about the coronavirus COVID-19 and VA benefits and services. If I can't answer all your questions, I'll help you connect to a call center representative.

**If you or someone else has any of these emergency warning signs of COVID-19, please call 911 to get medical care right away:**
- Trouble breathing
- Persistent (continuing) pain or pressure in the chest
- Bluish lips or face
- New confusion (suddenly feeling confused)
- Inability to arouse (trouble waking up or staying awake)
