# COVID-19 Chatbots Assessment
## Summary
The majority of COVID-19 specific chatbots are presented in a conversational UI with the bot asking a question and providing predefined responses for users to select (example: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/index.html)). Some chatbots are more advanced and allow users to enter free text questions at any point (see [Intermountain health](https://intermountainhealthcare.org/covid19-coronavirus/covid19-symptom-checker/) powered by [GYANT](https://gyant.com/)). Some organizations deviate from the conversational UI pattern by using a step-by-step question and answer format with a single question per page (see [NHS](https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19)). The information and types of questions in each solution appear to be similar. Some solutions are specific to symptom checking while others include more general FAQs about COVID-19. NHS deviates the most in language and tone by more thoroughly describing symptoms and providing examples when asking questions.
